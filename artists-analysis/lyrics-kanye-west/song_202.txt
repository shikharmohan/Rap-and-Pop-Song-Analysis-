(Hey Mama)
I wanna scream so loud for you
'Cuz I'm so proud of you
And let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool but I promise you I'm goin' back to school
And I appreciate what you allowed for me
And I just want you to be proud of me
(Hey Mama)
I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine I'm finna let it shine
I'm finna take ya'll back to them better times
I'm finna talk about my mama if ya'll don't mind
I was three years old, when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up somethin' that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me trainin' wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give me anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me your curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that, Mommy, can't you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
'Cuz a nigga cheatin, tellin' you lies
Then I started to cry as we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said, "Mommy, I'ma love you till you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'ma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford"
See you're, unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that's makin' loot
A livin' legend too, just look at what heaven do
Send us a angel and I thank you, Mama
(Hey Mama)
I wanna scream so loud for you
'Cuz I'm so proud of you
And let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school
And I appreciate what you allowed for me
And I just want you to be proud of me
(Hey Mama)
Forrest Gump mama said, "Life is like a box of chocolates"
My mama told me, "Go to school, get your doctorate
Somethin' to fall back on, you could profit with"
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get
Things I gotta do just to prove to you
You was gettin' through, can the choir please
Give me a verse of 'You Are So Beautiful To Me'?
Can't you see you're like a book of poetry?
Maya Angelou, Nicky Giovanni
Turn one page and there's my mommy
Come on, Mommy, just dance wit me
Let the whole world see your dancin' feet
Now when I say, "Hey", ya'll say, "Mama"
Now everybody answer me, c'mon
(Hey Mama)
I wanna scream so loud for you
'Cuz I'm so proud of you
And let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool but I promise you I'm goin' back to school
And I appreciate what you allowed for me
And I just want you to be proud of me
(Hey Mama)
I guess it also depends though, if my ends low
Second they get up you gon' get that Benzo
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let ya friends know
Tell your job you gotta fake 'em out
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out
To a restaurant, upper echelon
I'ma get you a Jag, whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of S-type, Donda West like?
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It don't gotta be Mother's Day or your birthday
For me to just call and say, "Mama"
(Hey Mama)
I wanna scream so loud for you
'Cuz I'm so proud of you
And let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey Mama)
You know I love you so and I'd never let you go
I wrote this song just so you know
No matter where you go, my love is true
