Uh, uh, uh
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Wake up, Mr. West, Mr. West, Mr. Fresh
Mr. By-his-self-he-so-impressed
I mean, damn, did you even see the test?
You got D's mother, D's, Rosie Perez
And yes, barely pass any and every class
Lookin' at every a**, cheated on every test
I guess this is my dissertation
Homie, this sh** is basic, welcome to Graduation
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning, on this day we become legendary
Everything we dreamed of
I'm like the fly Malcolm X, buy any jeans necessary
Detroit red cleaned up
From the streets of the league, from a ef to a ki
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets
From the moments of pain look how far we done came
Haters sayin' you changed, now you doin' your thang
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning, look at the valedictorian
Scared of the future while I hop in the Delorean
Scared to face the world, complacent career student
Some people graduate, but we still stupid
They tell you read this, eat this, don't look around
Just peep this, preach us, teach us, Jesus
Okay, look up now, they done stole your streetness
After all of that, you receive this
Good morning hustlers, that's if you're still livin'
Get on down every time that we hear them
Good morning hustlers, that's if you're still livin'
Get on down every time that we hear them
Good morning hustlers, that's if you're still livin'
Get on down every time that we hear them
Good morning hustlers, that's if you're still livin'
Get on down
Get on down
Get, get on down
Get on down
Get, get on down
