Hey Jimmy, where you goin'? I don't know where I'm going
My dad died, and uh, he left me his degrees
My Mom would always say, "Dad, why don't you work?"
But he just kept learning
All the other kids parents were working
And saving up money for school and I was actually in school
All while my dad was in school, he even
He was so greedy with degrees, he took my degree
And now I'm just glad he left me these
Because all the regular homeless people
Have newspapers and look what I have
These are documented, my father left them to me
And I'm gonna leave them to my kids
I'm gonna learn too, I'm gonna be super smart
So I too can die without money but I'll gonna be
The smartest dead guy, who has that?
