Why would she make calls out the blue?
Now I'm awake sleep isn't new
Hey, hey, hey, hey, don't say you will unless you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey, don't say you will then play you will
I pray you will
Misses so fly crash lands in my room
Can't waste no time she might leave soon
Hey, hey, hey, hey, don't say you will, you do
Hey, hey, hey, hey, don't say you will, one day you will
I pray you will
When I grab your neck I touch your soul
Take off your cool then lose control
Hey, hey, hey, hey, don't say you will, you will, you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey, don't say you will if you will
I pray you will
I wish this song would really come true
I admit I still fantasize about you, about you
Hey, hey, hey, hey, don't say you will, you will, you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey, please say, you will for real
I pray you will
