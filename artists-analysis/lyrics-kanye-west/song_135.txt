Why are you so paranoid?
Don't be so paranoid
Don't be so
Baby, don't worry 'bout it
Hey there, don't even think about it
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
Tell me right now
You really wanna spend your whole life alone?
A little timeout might do you good
Might do us good 'fore we be done for good
'Cause I can make it good, I can make it hood
I can make you come, I could make you go
I can make it high, I can make it fly
Make you touch the sky, hey maybe so
All the time you be up in mine
Checking through my cell phone, baby no
You wanna kill the vibe on another night?
Here's another fight, oh! Here we go
Baby, don't worry 'bout it
Lady, we'll go out to the floor
Anyway, they don't know you like I do
They'll never know you
Anyway, they don't know you like I do
They'll never know you
All of the time you wanna complain about the nights alone
So now you're here with me, show some gratitude
Leave the attitude way back at home
Yeah, you see 'em look, baby let 'em look
Give you cold looks 'cause we look cold
Yeah, you heard about all the word of mouth
Don't worry about what we can't control
All the talk in the world, lost in the world
'Til you finally let that thing go
You wanna check into the Heartbreak Hotel
But sorry we're closed
Baby, don't worry 'bout it
Baby, we'll go out to the floor
Anyway, they don't know you like I do
They'll never know you
Anyway, they don't know you like I do
They'll never know you
Baby, don't worry 'bout it
Lady, don't even think about it
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry 'bout the wrong things
Anyway, they don't know you like I do
They'll never know you
Anyway, they don't know you like I do
They'll never know you
Anyway, they don't know you like I do
They'll never know you
Anyway, they don't know you like I do
They'll never know you
