Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
She said she wants some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
A little Anita, will definitely set this party off right
(Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be)
(Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well, well, well, well, well)
She said she want some 'Ready for the Worldome, New Edition'
Some Minnie Ripperton and definitely set this party off right

I told her to drive over in your new whip
Bring some friends you cool with
I'mma bring da cool whip, then I want you to strip
See you is my new chick, so we get our grind on
She be grabbin', callin' me Biggie like Shine home
Man I swear she fine homes, why she always lying though
Tellin' me them diamonds when she know they rhinestones
She got a light skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
Got a dark skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
I play 'Ready for the World' she was ready for some action
My dawg said you ain't no freak, so you got to prove my man wrong
I'mma play this Vandross, you gon' take your pants off
I'mma play this Gladys Knight, me and you gon' get right
She said she wants some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross

Got you lookin' at the gliss at my hands and wrists
While I'm layin' back smokin' on my canibus
When it come to rockin' the rhythm like Marvin and Luther
I can tell you ain't no messin' with Kanman and Twist
From the Chi and I be sippin' Hennessey
Play some R&B;, Tryina smoke a B
Lookin' properly, feelin' on a G? and always
(Well, well, well, well, well)
Come with me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne
You ain't know Twista can work it like the Whispers
Hit the stop light, get into some Isaac
The rims still moving so I'm bumping a little spinners
While I'm smokin' on a B, dippin' through the streets
Bumpin' R&B; and I got to leave something to the 23's? And I do it
(Well, well, well, well, well)
When my earth and the wind smoke a fire
Let me when get your sheets wet listening to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze for maze, fulfilling our every temptation
Slow jamming having deep sex
You ready for the world girl, come on over make me touch
You all over your body baby don't say no to me
An every moment you controllin' me I'm lovin' the way
You be holding me when I be listening to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend your ass, you be bumpin'
Teddy Pendergrass, I'da hit it from the back to the melody to roll it slow
Now I gotta go up in it fast, but I'mma finish last
No matter how much of a thug you see
I still spit it like it's R&B;, so to the club with me
And with some Luther come on and hope you finna
And stilla be in love with me
She said she wants some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross

Baby drop another slow jam and all us lovers need hold hands
And if you ain't got no man hop up on my bro hem
I keep it pimpin' like an old man, you gots to roll with the plan
'Cause after that then I take it to the dome
Then I got to bone, stay up in the zone
Got to get you home, gotta run up on and I do it
(Well, well, well, well, well)
Baby drop another slow jam and all us lovers need hold hands

I keep it pimpin' like an old man, you gots to roll with the plan
'Cause after that then I take you to my home
And we could get it on, disconnect the phone
Just to get you goin', tryna make you moan and I do it
(Well, well, well, well, well)
