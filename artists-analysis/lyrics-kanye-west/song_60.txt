Playing a forty five
Sitting next to you
Thinking of a fantasy
Wishing it come true
Stratosphere of love
Waiting up above
Take me by the hand
And let's go.......
Soaring to the sky
Rolling on the clouds
Dancing in the heavens
Romancing under stars
Two starry eyed lovers
Whispering sweet delights
Sharing souls forever
Touching moonlight
Hold me in your arms
Fill me with your charms
Such an endless flight
All through the night
Soaring to the sky
Rolling on the clouds
Dancing in the heavens
Romancing under stars
Embracing one another
Filling up our hearts
Turning up the passion
Yearning for the sparks
Never let me go
We can last forever
Always by my side
You and me together
Soaring to the sky
Rolling on the clouds
Dancing in the heavens
Romancing under stars
Teasing one another
Stirring up the fire
Building up the heat
Loving with desire
Playing a forty five
Sitting next to you
Thinking of a fantasy
Wishing it come true
Playing a forty five
Sitting next to you
Thinking of a fantasy
Wishing it come true...... (to fade)
