I'm up in the woods,
I'm down on my mind,
I'm building a still
To slow down a time,
I'm up in the woods,
I'm down on my mind,
I'm building a still,
To slow down a time,
I'm up in the woods,
I'm down on my line,
I'm building a city,
Down the time,
I'm lost in the world,
I'm down my whole life,
I'm building a city,
And im down for the night,
Down for the night
says shes down for the night,
I'm never alone,
Down the time,
I'm lost in the world,
I'm down my whole life,
I'm new to the city,
Down for the night x3
Your my devil,your my angel
Your my heaven, your my hell,
You're my now, you're my forever,
You're my freedom, your my jail,
You're my lies your my truth,
You're my war you're my truce
Your my questions your my proof
Your my stress and your my masseuse  
Mama say mama say mama cu-san
Lost in this plastic life,
Let's break out of this fake ass party,
And turn this into a classic night,
If we die in each others arms,
still get layed in that afterlife,
if we die in each others arms,
still get layed, yea
(Chorus In the background)
I'm up in the woods,(background)
Run from the lights,
I'm down on my mind,(background)
Im from the night,
Run for your life,
I'm new in the city,(together)
Down for the nightx3
I'm lost in the world,
I'm down my whole life,
Im new in the city,
but im down for the night,
Down for the night [x3]
Eh Eh Ehh [x5]
Who will survive in America?[x4]
I'm lost in the world,
I'm down my whole life. ,
I'm new to the city,
Down for the night,
I'm lost in the world,
I'm down my whole life,
Im new to the city,
but im down for the night,
Down for the night [x3]

Heh wa uh [x5]

Us Living How We Do On The Side Now,
And the new words of hell is revolution,
people don't even want to hear the preachers spill or squeal,
because gods hoard has been thoroughly peaked
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey,
the Youngsters who were programmed to continue fucking up,
woke up one night diggin far and reveal Thinking Paul revere and mat turner as the good guys
America stripped from bed and we have not all yet closed our eyes,
The signs of truth were tattooed across our authentic vagina,
We learned to our amazement the untold tale of scandal,
2 long centuries burried in a rusty altar hosed down daily with gagging perfume,
America was a bastard a illegitimate daughter of the mother country whose legs were spread around the world and a rape as known as freedom,
Democracy liberty and justice were code words, for the (bubbling x4)
In the mother countries crotch,
What does Webster say about soul?
All I want is a good home and a wife and kids,
And some food to feed them every night.
After all is said and done,
Build a new route to china if they'll have you
Who will survive in America? [x5]
