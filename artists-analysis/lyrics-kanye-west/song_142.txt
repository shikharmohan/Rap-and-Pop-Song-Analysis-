Are you gonna be
Say that you're gonna be
She said she wants some Marvin Gaye
Some Luther Vandross, a little Anita
Will definitely set this party off right
She said she want some 'Ready for the world'
Some New Edition, some Minnie Ripperton
Will definitely set this party off right
I told her to drop over in your new whip, bring some friends you cool with
I'mma bring da cool whip, then I want you to strip
See you is my new chick, so we get our grind on
She be grabbin', callin' me Biggie like Shyne home
Man I swear she fine homes, why she always lying though
Tellin' me them diamonds, when she know they rhinestones
She got a light skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
Got a dark skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
I played, 'Ready for the world', she was ready for some action
My dawg said you ain't no freak, so you 'bout to prove my man wrong
I'mma play this Vandross, you gon' take your pants off
I'mma play this Gladys Knight, me and you gon' get right
She said she wants some Marvin Gaye
Some Luther Vandross, a little Anita
Will definitely set this party off right
She said she want some 'Ready for the world'
Some New Edition, some Minnie Ripperton
Will definitely set this party off right
I got you lookin' at the glass at my hands and wrists
While I'm layin' back and smokin' on my canibus
When it come to rockin' the rhythm like Marvin and Luther
I can tell you ain't no messin' with Kan-man and Twist
From the Chi and I be sippin' Hennessey
Play some R & B tryina smoke a B
Lookin' properly feelin' on a G and always
Come with me and sip on some heavenly champagne
You ain't know Twista can work it like the Whispers
Hit the stop light, get into some Isaac
The rims still moving so I'm bumping a little spinners
While I'm smokin' on a B, dippin' through the streets
Bumpin' R&B; and I got to leave on the 23's and I do it
When my earth and the wind smoke a fire
Let me get your sheets wet listening to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze for maze
Fulfilling your every temptation slow jamin' having deep sex
You ready for the world girl, come on over make me touch you
All over your body baby don't say no to me
An' every no to me, controllin' me
I'm lovin' the way you be holding me when I be listening to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend your ass
You be bumpin' Teddy Pendergrass
I'da hit it from the back to the melody to roll it slow
Now I gotta go up in it fast, but I'mma finish last
No matter how much of a thug you see
I still spit it like it's R&B;, come the club with me
And when some Luther come on I hope you filla me
And stilla be in love with me
She said she wants some Marvin Gaye
Some Luther Vandross, a little Anita
Will definitely set this party off right
She said she want some 'Ready for the world'
Some New Edition, some Minnie Ripperton
Will definitely set this party off right
Baby, drop another slow jam
And all us lovers need hold hands
And if you ain't got no man, hop up on my brougham
I keep it pimpin' like an old man, you gots to roll with the plan
'Cuz after that then I take it to the dome
Then I got to bone, stay up in the zone
Got to get you home, gotta run up on
And I do it
Baby, drop another slow jam
And all us lovers need hold hands
And if you ain't got no man, hop up on my brougham
I keep it pimpin' like an old man, you gots to roll with the plan
'Cuz if not that then, I take you to my home
And we could get it on disconnect the phone
Tryina to get you goin', tryina make you moan
And I do it
