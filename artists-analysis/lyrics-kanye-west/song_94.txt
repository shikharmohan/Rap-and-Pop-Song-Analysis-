Yo, uh, uh c'mon
I've been so lonely girl, I've been so sad and down
Couldn't understand why haters joked around
I wanted to be free with other creatures like me
And now I got my wish, cause i know that I'm a gay fish (gay fish)
(Gay fish Yo) mother fuckin' gay fish
(I'm a fish yo) goin' on a gay fish
(It's alright girl) makin' love to other gay fish
All those lonely nights at the grocery store
In the frozen fish aisle feelin' like a whore 
Cause I wasn't being true 
Even though everyone said that I had to make a switch
(Gay fish) now I know that I'm a gay fish (gay fish)
(Gay fish Yo) mother fuckin' gay fish
(I'm a fish yo) Goin' on a gay fish
(Now I'm where i belong girl) makin' love to other gay fish
I used to be scared, denying who I was
Acting straight but then going out to the gay fish clubs
Dancing with the Marlins making out with the all the Snappers
I'd take a Salmon home and work that Coddle Fin for hours
But now I'm out and I'm free to love what I want
Be it Yellow Fin or Bass or them trout in Vermont
I slapped that Holland ass, make that Grouper butt shake
I'll come to your house and have an orgy in your motherfuckin' fish tank (fish tank, fish tank)
Mother fuckin' gay fish
(I'm a fish yo) Goin' on a gay fish
(Yeah now I'm where i belong girl) makin' love to other gay fish
I really get around I'm the slut of the sea
When i say I've got crabs I mean it literally
I was eating dinner and just had to go down on that Mackerel on the dish
Cause I'm the gayest of the gay fish (gay fish)
Mother fuckin' gay fish
(I'm a fish yo) Goin' on a gay fish
Yeah now I'm where i belong girl
But I gotta settle down I can't be a whore
I ain't gonna just sleep with any fish no more
I've found me a lover, a brother who's a cross-dressing Pike named Trish
And together we are gay fish (gay fish)
(Gay fish yo) motherfuckin' gay fish
(I'm a fish yo) goin' on a gay fish
(Yeah, now I'm where i belong girl) makin' love to other gay fish
(Gay fish, gay fish, gay fish, gay fish, gay fish, gay fish...)
