You motherfuckers better do your job and roll up
And watch how we roll up and
I can't control it, can't hold it, it's so nuts
I take a sip of that n'gak, I wanna fuck
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
But really what's amazing is how I keep it blazing
Towel under the door, I'm smokin' to the Days Inn
Puff, puff then pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hypnotic for Henny, now nigga that's a chaser
Turn nothin' to something now pimpin' that's the Savior
Best things are green now pimpin' get your paper
High off the ground, our status skyscraper
Cool off thinkin' we local, come on homie, we major
We major?
Come on, homie, we major
We major?
Come on, homie, we major
We major?
Come on, homie, we major
We major?
Come on
Feeling better than some head on a Sunday afternoon
Better than a chick that say yes to soon
Until you have a daughter, that's what I call karma
And you pray to God she don't grow breasts too soon
Projects to' up, gang signs is thrown up
Niggas hats broke off that's how we grow up
Why else you think shorty's write rhymes just to blow up?
Get they first car and then IRS show up
He ain't never had shit but he had that nine
Nigga come through flickin' and he had that shine
Put two and two together in a little bad weather
Gon' be a whole family on that funeral line
Ask the reverend was the strip club cool
If my tips help send a pretty girl through school
That's all I want like wino's want they good whiskey
I ain't in the Klan, but I brought my hood with me
You motherfuckers better do your job and roll up
And watch how we roll up and
I can't control it, can't hold it, it's so nuts
I take a sip of that n'gak, I wanna fuck
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
But really what's amazing is how I keep it blazing
Towel under the door, I'm smokin' to the Days Inn
Puff, puff then pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hypnotic for Henny, now nigga that's a chaser
Turn nothin' to something now pimpin' that's the Savior
Best things are green now pimpin' get your paper
High off the ground, our status skyscraper
Cool off thinkin' we local, come on homie, we major
We major?
Come on, homie, we major
We major?
Come on, homie, we major
We major?
Come on, homie, we major
We major?
Come on, homie, we major
I heard the beat and I ain't know what to write
First line, should it be about the hoes or the ice?
4-4's or Black Christ? Both flows would be nice
Rap about big paper or the black man plight
At the studio console asked my man to the right
What this verse sound like, should I freestyle or write?
He said, "Nas, what the fans want is 'Illmatic', 'Stillmatic'"
Picked up the pad and pencil and jotted what I feel
Been like 12 years since a nigga first signed
Now I'm a free agent and I'm thinking it's time
To build my very own Motown
'Cuz rappers be deprived of executive 9 to 5s
And it hurts to see these companies be stealing the life
And I love to give my blood sweat and tears to the mic
So y'all copped the LPs and y'all fiends got dealt
I'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony where King got killed
I survived the livest niggas around
Lasting longer than more than half of you clowns
Look, I used to cook before I had the game took
Either way my change came like Sam Cooke
Feeling better than I ever felt before today
Like better late than never it's orientation
Still we can make it better throwing all your cares away
You motherfuckers better do your job and roll up
And watch how we roll up and
I can't control it, can't hold it, it's so nuts
I take a sip of that n'gak, I wanna fuck
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
But really what's amazing is how I keep it blazing
Towel under the door, I'm smokin' to the Days Inn
Puff, puff then pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hypnotic for Henny, now nigga that's a chaser
Turn nothin' to something now pimpin' that's the Savior
Best things are green now pimpin' get your paper
High off the ground, our status skyscraper
Cool off thinkin' we local, come on homie, we major
We major?
Come on, homie, we major
We major?
Come on, homie, we major
We major?
Come on, homie, we major
We major?
Feeling better than I ever felt before today
Like better late than never it's orientation
Still we can make it better throwing all your cares away
Can I talk my shit again? Can I talk my shit again?
I can't believe I'm back up in this mu'fukka
I'ma be late tho'
I figga out what I'm finna wear, yeah
The Roc is definitely in the building
Good music def in the building
I gotta say what's up to Tony Williams
On the vocals, fiends rock good music don't you agree
Don't you agree?
And John Brion on the keys right now
And Warren Cambele on the keys right now
So they asked me, why you call it late registration man?
'Cause we taking these motherfuckers back to school
And if you know this part, feel free to sing along
Feeling better than I ever felt before today
Like better late than never it's orientation
Still we can make it better throwing all your cares away
You can't do what we do baby
You can't do what we do baby
You can't do what we do baby
Yeah
