Yeah, you know what this is
It's a celebration, bitches
Grab a drink, grab a glass
After that I grab yo' ass
Why you actin' all shy and all?
Why is y'all lyin' for?
I never did this before, stop that
What, you want some Petron?
I got that
I mean, I promise y'all, you fine and all
And your girlfriend, she kinda raw
But she not like you
No, she not like you
Right now, I need you to mute all the monologue
All that talkin is gon' give me a Tylenol
You put a nigga to sleep, I'm tired of y'all
Right now, the Louis Vuitton don is signing off
But, I just thought you should know
We hit the liquor store, got some Cris and some Mo
And we about to let it flow
Had some problems before but see we let 'em go
Got an ounce of that dro and we about to let it blow
Yeah, you know what this is
It's a celebration, bitches
Grab a drink, grab a glass
After that, I grab yo' ass
See, you know my style, I'm very wild
And I vow that my child will be well endowed
Like his daddy
And tell him that your mama had a fattie
He looked up at me said
"Daddy, that's the reason why you had me?"
Yep, we was praticin'
Till one day your ass bust through the packagin'
You know what though? You my favorite accident
So go 'head, pop some Cristal
For my newborn child 'cuz now y'all
Know what this is
It's a celebration, bitches
Grab a drink, grab a glass
After that, I grab yo' ass
But, I just thought you should know
We hit the liquor store, got some Cris and some Mo
And we about to let it flow
Had some problems before but see we let 'em go
Got an ounce of that dro and we about to let it blow
Ho, ho, we lookin' for some, ho, ho, ha
