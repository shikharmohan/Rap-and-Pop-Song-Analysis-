(Kanye)
I'm in love with you
But the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me all the way home
So you never know
Never, never know
Never know enough
Til it's over love
I'm not lovin' you
Way I wanted to
What I had to do
Had to run from you
I'm in love with you
But the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me all the way home
So I keep in mind
When I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home
In the danger zone
How many times did I tell you
'fore it finally got through
You lose, you lose
How many times did I tell you
'fore it finally got through
You lose, you lose
(LMFAO)
Lmfao rock the beat and rock the show
move your feet on to the floor 
start to freak and drink some more
Im in love with you 
but the love is gone it aint over baby
cause we still can bone
I see that day you left me
for another dude and now your heart is, empty feeling so confused.
now you want me back trying to re -attach begging please on your knees
trying to suck me back
but you done broke my heart into a million pieces
i should of seen it coming , wish i had telekinesis 
i said you broke my heart into a million pieces 
i cant love you but i can fuck you till you call me jesus
Im in love with you but it aint the same
girl i sip the goose and that aint gon' change
you telling me im doing wrong
well lock me up, so im gone
i love the party (love the party)
love the club (love the club)
i want your body (i want your body)
not your love 
girl you know my love is real (love is real)
but you cant control me 
baby, you know just how i feel (just how i feel)
so you cant control me......Me x7

girl you know my love is real (love is real)
but you cant control me
baby, you know just how i feel (just how i feel)
so you cant control me baby  x2
