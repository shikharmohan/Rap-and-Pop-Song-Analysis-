You keep it going man, you keep those books rolling
You pick up all those books that your going to read
And not remember and you roll, man
You get that a sociate degree, okay
Then you get your bachelors, then you get your masters
Then you get your master's masters
Then you get your doctrine, you go, man
And then when everybody says quit
You show them those degrees, man
When everybody says, "Hey
You're not working, you're not making any money"
You say, "You look at my degrees and you look at my life
Yeah, I'm fifty two, so what, hate all you want
But I'm smart, I'm so smart, and I'm in school
These guys are out here making money all these ways
And I'm spendin' mine to be smart, you know why?
Because when I die, buddy, you know
What's going to keep me warm, that's right, those degrees"
