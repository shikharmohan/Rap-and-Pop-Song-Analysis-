yeah
just a little bit
just a little bit
life styles of the rich and famous
bought a big house and a whole lot of ranges
a fresh new couch and a whole lot of trainers
a closset full of clothes and some brand new dangers
and some mexican floral arrangers
a great big tv that'll entertain us
some colourful commissions from some high paid painters
someone to take the rap so i stay stainless
a new relationship with a banker and
two pinky rings for my manicured fingers
a trained german shepard that barks when its angered
  to watch my possesions and look out for strangers and
a 50ft yaht with an anchor a young super model who shall remain nameless
the ups and the downs
the sames and the changes
all the money in the world dont make it painless
but they love it and they love it
CHORUS (Tom Yorke)
The more you try to erase me
The more, the more
The more that I appear
Oh the more, the more
The more you try the eraser
The more, the more
The more that you appear
(Kanye)
lifestyles of the broke an famous
let you know how crazy this game is
look at all the new beautiful faces
at home supermodels myspaces
long for the shot on the tv screen
american idol never seen these dreams
just last week they wanna see ID
now they got you in VIP
huh?
how many people almost famous
you almost remember what there name is
like hey didnt you play in
no i couldnt be quit playing
and trying to keep that balance
after MTV thats a real world challenge
back on that train
never to be heard from again
but they love it and they love it
CHORUS (Tom Yorke)
The more you try to erase me
The more, the more
The more that I appear
Oh the more, the more
The more you try the eraser
The more, the more
The more that you appear
(pharrell)
g-r-i-p-p-i-n-p-i-n-e spell it bitch come on thats me
i bring a burning sensation to the urban eye
like an eye drop of turpentine
you can listen to the serpant fine
 but the earth got gas once it burps its fine
some around me they talk about degrees
not ghg's
how to cook a quater ki
talking all nazel he aint over that cold
no glove, scrub, man he just over that stove
perfect paradigm
wrong place wrong time
should have been Pfizer
glaxosmithkline
number one chemist
look at it no blemish
egg shell off white like a dupont finish
young dumb high strung
who can handle us
I wonder how Gods gunna paint todays canvas'
coz who knew that day
that man would just
go to VA with a tec and spray campuses
what a way to see the cover of Time
I know that nigga wish he was standing in line
to see it
as if he didnt do it
but they love it and they love it
CHORUS (Tom Yorke)
The more you try to erase me
The more, the more
The more that I appear
Oh the more, the more
The more you try the eraser
The more, the more
The more that you appear
