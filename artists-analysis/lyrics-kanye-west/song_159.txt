Kanye, can I talk to you for a minute?
Me and the other faculty members
Was wonderin' could you do a little some, somethin' beautiful
Somethin' that the kids is gonna love when they hear it
That is gonna make them start jumpin' up and down
And sharin' candy and stuff
Think you could probably do somethin'
For the kids for graduation to sing?
