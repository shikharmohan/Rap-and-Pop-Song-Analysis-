Lots change about necessities that people seek without regard
To where they are, the human heart is curious above all this
Lots things to know, you eyes about the music make me see the light

Don't tell me you sing, you about to get a deal
You drunk and hot girls
Aaa, aaa, aa, aa, aa, that's how the fuck you sound
