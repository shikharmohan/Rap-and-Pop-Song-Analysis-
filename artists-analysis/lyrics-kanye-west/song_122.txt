Yeah, DC, Stand up for your boy Ka Ree
I go by the name of Kanye Tutter
the rock is in the building
and as far as I'm concern we about to bring that real soul back to the game
John Legend on the backgrounds by the way
let's go 
From what I hear Kanye is killing the game very bad
My girl rocking the little lamb that mary had
a little bit of dolsic style(?) makes the most it style
I'm versatile I'm the post it child
getting cheese so I'm suppose to smile (get it)
we makin hits like sosa now hit it
and i hate when girls acting boogie as hell 
and I already seen them naked like lu kang trail
If I talk to people like they stupid as hell
do that mean god gone make my people stupid as hell
do that mean god gone make my kids be stupid as well

It was so soulful Man
It's so soulful Man
It's so soulful man
and right here is where it feels like soul food man
Look My mommy don't be playing, cause she know I got my game in tact
I spit them lines that make a rapper have a brain attack
and chickens know I'm gonna do it the way I'm gonna do it.
and miss communication no we never run into it
I got chicks like Simone and Cala
stay with lip gloss and fitty bag beside her
and your girl said you aint ready for me
I'm in love so mommy got me singing Tina Marie

Yo, I'm a worry about the trade then bore then try and trade it all
I'd rather catch up on my paper and invade the mall
you sore losers picked the wrong guy to take the fall
I probably trade in the fall what they made in the fall
went from a never quite was to an overnight was
cause the way I flip metaphor nobody quite does
by the time I leave the club I'm wearing a public arms
cause he must have been a pro the way see the pros and cons
they callin this the army 
money boys are we say jay b hopping down when I'm  trying do my laundry
but I aint even sorry the way I get my dough
