One hand in the air
If you don't really care
Two hands in the air
If you don't really care
It's like that sometimes
I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes
This shit ridiculous
One hand in the air
If you don't really care
Middle Finger in the air
If you don't really care
It's like that sometimes man ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous
[Kanye]
I'm so appalled spalding ball,
Baldin Donald Trump, talkin dollars from ya'll
Baby your fired, your girlfriend hired
But if you don't mind I'mma keep you on call
We above the law, we don't give a fuck bout ya'll
I got dogs that'll chew a fuckin whole through the wall
But since they all love us, I need more rubbers
And If i dont use rubbers, need more covers
Housekeeping, I mean goddamn
One time, let it be a bad bitch sweepin
That know we get O's like cheerios
That know because they seen us in the videos
That know the day that you play me
Will be the same day MTV play videos
That was a little joke, voila
Praises due to the most high Allah
Praises due to the most fly Prada
Baby I'm magic ta-da
Address me as your highness, high as united
Thirty thousand feet up and you are not invited
niggas be writin bullshit like they gotta work
niggas is goin through real shit man they outta work
That's why another goddamn dance track gotta hurt
That's why I rather spit somethin that gotta purp
Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean the shit is fuckin ridiculous, fuckin ridiculous
I mean the shit is fuckin ridiculous...
5 star dishes
Different exotic fishes
Man this shit if fuckin riculous, fuckin ridicolous
[Jay-Z]
How should I begin this
I'm just so offended
How am I even mentioned by all these fuckin beginners?
I'm so appalled
I might buy the mall
Just to show niggas how much more I have in store
I'm fresher than you all
So I don't have to pause
All of yall can suck my balls through my draws
Dark knight feelin'
Die you be a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villan
I went from the favorite
To the most hated
But would you rather be underpaid or overrated?
Moral victories is for minor league coaches
And 'ye already told you we major you cockroaches
Show me where the boats is
Ferrari testarossas
The hammer went and broke so you know I'm more focused
I lost 30 mill so spent another 30
Cause unlike hammer 30 million can't hurt me
Fucking insane
The fuck am I saying
Not only am I fly
I'm fucking not Playin
All these little bitches
Too big for their riches
Burning their little bridges
Fucking ridiculous
Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean the shit is fuckin ridiculous, fuckin ridiculous
I mean the shit is fuckin ridiculous...
5 star dishes
Different exotic fishes
Man this shit if fuckin riculous, fuckin ridicolous
[Pusha T]
Success is what you make it
Take it how it come
A half a mill in 20's like a billion where I'm from
An arrogant drug dealer the legend I've become
CNN said I'd be dead by 21
Blackjack I just pulled in Aces
You looking at the king and his face
Everything I dream motherfuckers Im watchin it take shape
While to you I'm just the young rich nigga that lacks faith
Range rove leather roof, love war fuck a truce
Still move a bird like I'm in bed with mother goose
Them hoes comin in a baker's dozen
Claiming they was wit me when they know they really wasn't
I keep the city's best never said she was the brightest
So if you had her too it don't effect me in the slightest
I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance
So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness
I speak the gospel, hostile
Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils
Paranoid mind I'm still under the watchful
Eye of the law, aspire for more
Those kilo's came we give you bobby brown jaw
Flaws ain't flaws when it's you that makes the call
Flow similar to the legends of the falls
Spillin I own you all
Yeh!
Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean the shit is fuckin ridiculous, fuckin ridiculous
I mean the shit is fuckin ridiculous...
5 star dishes
Different exotic fishes
Man this shit if fuckin riculous, fuckin ridicolous
[Cyhi the Prince]
Huh, I am so outrageous
I wear my pride on my sleeve like a bracelet
If god had an ipod I'd be on his playlist
My phrases amazing, the faces and places the favourite
My cup over runeth with hundreths
Dummy damn its hard not for me to waste it
The new commandment
Though should not hate kid
My movement is like the Civil Rights I'm Ralph David
Abernathy, so call my lady rosa parks
I ain't nothing like those niggas baby those are marks
I met this girl on valentines day
Fucked her in may
She found out about april
So she chose to march
Ha
Damn another broken heart
I keep bitches by them two's nigga, Noah's ark
I got a 7 on me
I call my dro Lamar
Plus a Trojan in my pocket, Matt Leinart
G-A-T in the path finder
Cause you haters got PHD's
Yall just some major haters and some math minors
Tiger woods don't make me grab iron
[RZA]
Champagne wishes and thirty white bitches
You know this shit is fuckin ridiculous, fuckin ridiculous
You know this shit is fuckin ridiculous...
Calls from the Mrs.
Infers from the mistress
You kno that shit is fuckin ridiculous, fuckin ridiculous
You know this shit is fuckin ridiculous...
fuckin ridiculous

fuckin ridiculous
One hand in the air
If you don't really care
Two hands in the air
If you don't really care
It's like that sometimes
I mean ridiculous

This shit ridiculous
One hand in the air
If you don't really care
Middle Finger in the air
If you don't really care
It's like that sometimes man ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous
Huh!
