Diamonds are forever
They won't leave in the night
Have no fear that they might desert me
(Diamonds are forever, forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
(Diamonds are forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
(Forever and ever)
Forever ever, forever ever, ever ever
Ever ever, ever ever, ever ever, ever ever
Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic, Vegas on acid
Seen through Yves Saint Laurent glasses
And I realize that I've arrived
'Cuz it took more than a magazine to kill my vibe
Does he write his own rhymes, just sort of
I think 'em, that mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask, "If we talk about classics do my name get brought up?"
I remember I couldn't afford
A Ford Escort or even a 4 track recorder
So it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop
Top Porsche spoil yourself, that's important
If you a stripper named Porsche and you get tips from any man
Then your fat friend, her nickname is Minivan
Excuse me, that's just the Henney man
I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop, I can't because
(Diamonds are forever, forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
(Diamonds are forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
(Forever and ever)
Forever ever, forever ever, ever ever
Ever ever, ever ever, ever ever, ever ever
I was sick about awards, couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed and kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys try talk some sense in him
Thirty minutes later seen there's no convincin' him
What more could you ask for, the international asshole
Who complains about what he is owed
And throw a tantrum like he is 3 years old
You gotta love it tho somebody still speak from his soul
And wouldn't change by the chains or the game or the fame
When he came in the game he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
It's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say Kayne
Got family in the D, Kin Folk from Motown
Back in the chi them folks ain't from Motown
Life movin' too fast I need to slow down
Girl ain't gimme no ass, she need to go down
My father Ben said I need Jesus so he took me to church
  (Diamonds are forever, forever, forever)
And let the water wash over my Caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
  (Diamonds are forever, forever, forever)
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you could call, you got a message then leave it
  (Forever and ever)
The Roc stand tall or you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yeah, the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust gets swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit it sound like the best of
A and R's lookin' like, "Pshh, we messed up"
Grammy night, damn right we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle till we got messed up
In the studio where Really Doe, yeah he next up
People askin' me, "Is I'm gon' give my chain back?"
That'd be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog, "Yo where dame at?"
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
Wassup wit you and Jay man, are y'all okay man?
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
R-r-right here stands a man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands
(Diamonds are forever, forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
(Diamonds are forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
(Forever and ever)
Forever ever, forever ever, ever ever
Ever ever, ever ever, ever ever, ever ever
Ever ever, ever ever, ever ever
Diamonds are forever, forever, forever
Diamonds are forever, forever, forever
Forever
