Ayyo, good morning, America, good morning to Erica
Who gave me good *** while watching good morning America
And good day, New York, have a good day in court
My homies drive around the hood and that's a good place to start
I never liked the goodbyes, always caught a good vibe
Always had a good time, could always spot a good guy
From a good guy, look alive, look alive, look or try
You know that old saying what they say about good guys
I guess that's why I went bad, needed all my chicks bad
Fiends needed it bad, started hittin' liqs' bad
Had to get that work off before that s*** went bad
If not, it gets bad and things will only get bad
So now I'm getting bad skin and I got that badge and
Tellin' me them bastards don't catch a bad break
Caught a bad rate on whip with bad brakes
I'm caught up in these bad ways havin' a bad day
So now the game's ugly and my pain's ugly
And my chain's ugly, things became ugly [Incomprehensible]
Got a stain and its musty, wakin' up looking crusty
And miss thang who's ugly is sayin' to me, "Don't touch me"
I went from pretty Willie to pretty silly
But I'm still pretty gully so you know thin's will still get pretty ugly
And this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
B.I.G. said get ya money ain't no telling they gon' love me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
When your money get funny and them days ain't sunny
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
*** give pounds and hug me, know they really wanna slug me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
And this is for the hood, you got to love me
Good morning to ummm, I don't remember your name
But I remember the brain, here go a fare for the train and
Good morning to Chi-Town, where my *** ride down
And bust clowns and look for some bust downs to bust down
Yeah, she ain't got a car she on the bus now
But her gear is bangin', she one of us now
I wanted badly to bone 'cuz she was bad to the bone
She from a batter home, she mad when she at home
So I gave her my number to beep off, she wanted to take a week off
Bustin' scary movie ***, I had to get the freak off
The new Tom Cruise, took the Moulin Rouge on a too long cruise
She said, "I ain't ***  you with them two long shoes"
And I get bougie in a grape poupon mood
So I'ma act cheap in a coupon mood
She said, "Ye' you don't love me?"
I told her it was good, it's too bad, yeah ugly
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
B.I.G. said, get ya money, ain't no telling they gon' love me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
And this for the hood, you got to love me
Ayyo, good morning to Queens, the North side of my scene
And when it comes down to it, I'm a ride for my team
See it's a beautiful life but the bills will make it ugly
And the beauty of life is when you're forced to make it ugly
Had a beautiful night 'til a storm done made it ugly
And a beautiful wife, now we divorcing and it's ugly
Now my mind state is ugly, my blind dates are ugly
And I'm ready to turn it up in these streets and make it ugly
Used to sit in Mr. Uglies with these sisters that was ugly
And these *** used to bug me to the point it made me ugly
And say things that was ugly and lead a ball abruptly
But I took it all back 'cuz God don't like ugly
Now I'm curbin' my bad words, they say that the bad burn
I left it on bad terms with a chic with a bad perm
Whose case took a bad turn and face caught a bad burn
And took the news bad when they said, she had bad germs
The bad thing about it was she was bad and 'bout it
But you know what smelled bad so I had to get up out it
So now we got bad blood, her son is a bad blood
But it happens in the hood when you inherit that bad blood
And once it get bad, it be bad for good
And that's bad meaning bad, not bad meaning good
But I greet it as good when you leave with the good
It's all good in the hood, got called good 'cuz it's good
Now I'm havin' some good nights, livin' this good life
Got me a good girl that I'ma make me a good wife
So I'm good to go and I'm good where I go
Come on, man got good aim and that's a good thing to know
And he came home for good, off of good behavior
Spittin' that good game so what's good with this paper?
And this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
Ayyo, we showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
B.I.G. said get ya money, ain't no telling they gon' love me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
When your money get funny and them days ain't sunny
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
***  give pounds and hug me, know they really wanna slug me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
And this for the hood, you got to love me
