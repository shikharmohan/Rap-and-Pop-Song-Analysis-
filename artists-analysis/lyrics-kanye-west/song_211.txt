I'm so appalled spalding ball, ballin
Donald Trump, talkin dollars from ya'll
Baby you're fired, your girlfriend's hired
But if you don't mind I'mma keep you on call
We above the law, we don't give a fuck bout ya'll
I got dogs that'll chew a fuckin whole through the wall
But since they all love us, I need more rubbers
And I don't use rubbers, need more covers
Housekeeping, I mean goddamn
One time, let it be a bad bitch sweepin
That know we get O's like Cheerios
That know because they seen us in the videos
That know the day that you play me
Will be the same day MTV play videos
That was a little joke, walla
Praises do to the most high Allah
Praises do to the most fly Prada
Baby I'm magic ta-da
Address me as your heiness, high as united
Thirty thousand feet up and you are not invited
Niggas be writin bullshit like they gotta work
Niggas is goin through real shit man they outta work
That's why I never goddamn dance track that'll hurt
That's why I rather spit somethin that gotta purp
Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean the shit is fuckin ridiculous, fuckin ridiculous
I mean the shit is fuckin ridiculous...
Fuckin ridiculous, I mean the shit is fuckin ridiculous
My name on the high lines, writtin cross the sky lines
Lookin at my Rollie, muthafucka it's my time
By the way, where's the waiter at with the mai tais?
We the black dynasty these the days of our lives
Hatin from the sidelines, givin you the guidelines
