'Bout the baddest girl I ever seen
Straight up outta movie scene
Who knew she was a drama queen?
That'll turn my life to Stephen King's
Up late night like she on patrol
Checking everything like I'm on parole
I told her it's some things she don't need to know
She never let it go, oh
Okay okay, okay okay, you will never stop it now
You never stop it now
Okay, okay okay, you will never stop it now
You need to drop it now, drop it, drop it
'Cause I don't want no robocop
You movin' like a robocop
When did you become a robocop?
No, I don't need a robocop
Just looking at your history
You're like the girl from Misery
She said, she ain't take it to this degree
Well, let's agree to disagree
Shorty kind crazy but it turned me on
Keep it up enough to keep it going on
I told her it's some things she don't need to know
She never let it go, oh
Okay okay, okay okay, you will never stop it now
You never stop it now
Okay, okay okay, you will never stop it now
You need to drop it now, drop it, drop it
'Cause I don't want no robocop
You movin' like a robocop
When did you become a robocop?
Somebody please make her stop
Stop, drop, roll, pop, b****, I'm cold, hot
Ain't used to be in tow, stop, so I can never be your robot
Fast or slow, you could stay, you could go
Na, na, now that you know, na, na, now that you know
Yeah, I had her before, but that happened before
You get mad when you know, so jus' don't ask me no more
Okay, okay, okay, ah, ah
It ain't okay, okay, okay, ah
You spoilt little L.A. girl, you're just an L.A. girl
You spoilt little L.A. girl, you're just an L.A. girl
You spoilt little L.A. girl, you're just an L.A. girl
(You need to stop it now)
You spoilt little L.A. girl, you're just an L.A. girl
(You need to stop it now)
Oh, you're kidding me, you must be joking or you are smoking
Oh, oh, you're kidding me, oh, you're kidding me
Ha, ha, that was a good one, your first good one in a while
Your first good one in a while, you need to stop it now
You need to stop it now, oh, you need to stop it now
