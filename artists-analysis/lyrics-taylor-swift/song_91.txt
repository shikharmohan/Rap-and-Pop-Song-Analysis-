I walk in the room thereÃÂ¢€s a beautiful sunshine ray
Across the room
Then I hear the phone ring walk to it and I donÃÂ¢€t what to say
Hello, Good day
But what I do know, it that tonight is gonna be the night, when
Chorus:
He says I love you and I really care about you
When, He says heÃÂ¢€ll hold me in his arms when IÃÂ¢€m afraid
When, IÃÂ¢€ll say, Oh, IÃÂ¢€ll say I love him too
And, I care about you, yeah this ainÃÂ¢€t no charade. 
Then heÃÂ¢€ll drive me home listeninÃÂ¢€ to the radio
Then, He says he really loves me too and do anything
Oh, I walk through the door thereÃÂ¢€s a beautiful moonlight shine
Across the room
I crawl into bed thinkinÃÂ¢€ what I did today
With him
But what I do know, is that, I love him too.  
And the next time I see, him walking down the street (down the street)
IÃÂ¢€ll think about this time, that was as beautiful sunshine.
Oh!
Chorus:
He says I love you and I care about you
Yeah, He says heÃÂ¢€ll hold in his arms when IÃÂ¢€m afraid.
And IÃÂ¢€ll say, I love you too, yeah, I love you
Oh, IÃÂ¢€ll say, I care about you, yeah this aint no charade
Then heÃÂ¢€ll drive me home, listeninÃÂ¢€ to the radio
Then, He says, he really loves me and heÃÂ¢€ll do anything
Bridge:
I look in his brown eyes
And I see a surprise
ItÃÂ¢€s like a present that you open
Oh, and do know oh do you know
What that surprise is?
ItÃÂ¢€s love.  
And the next time I see him walkinÃÂ¢€ down the streets in his old white t-shirt, IÃÂ¢€ll always remember, this time, that was a beautiful as sunshine.  
Ohhh ohhh ohhhh sunshine
Ohhhh ohhh ohhh sunshiiiiine
Sunshine sun sun sunshine
Was as beautiful as sunshine.
