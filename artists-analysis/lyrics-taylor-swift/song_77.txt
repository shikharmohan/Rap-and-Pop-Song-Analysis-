The way you move is like a full on rainstrom
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless that should send me running
But I kind of know that I won't get far 
And You stood there in front of me
Just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see 
What I was thinking of 
[Chorus] Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain 
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby , as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around 
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile
My mind forgets to remind me, you're a bad idea
You touch me once, and it's really something
You find I'm even then you imagined I would be 
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world, but with you I know it's no good 
And i could wait patiently
But i really wish you would
[Chorus] Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile 
Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile 
I run my fingers through your hair
And watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me 
It's just strong enough to make you feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow 
I'm captivated by you baby, like a fireworks show
[Chorus] Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby 
As the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile 
And the sparks fly
Oh baby smile, and the sparks fly
