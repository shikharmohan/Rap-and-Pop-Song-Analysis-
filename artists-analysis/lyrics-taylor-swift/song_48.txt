I bet you lie awake at night trying to make up your sweet mind 
Wonderin if you'll ever find just what you want 
A hometown number one 
Or a California loaded gun
But you'll only get one 
That's what you thought 
And here's what you got
I could be your favorite blue jeans 
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer 
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little out of reach 
Or the girl living next door
I'll be your angel giving up her wings 
If that's what you need 
I'd give everything to be your anything 
Be your anything
If you want hard to get 
If you want
All you have to do is let me know
If you want a bumby ride 
Or someone with a softer side 
Either one will be alright 
Just let me know
Cause this is how it goes 
I could be your favorite blue jeans 
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer 
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little out of reach 
Or the girl living next door
I'll be your angel giving up her wings 
If that's what you need 
I'd give everything to be your anything 
It's not like I'm giving up who i am for you
But with someone like you it's so easy to do
I could be your favorite blue jeans 
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer 
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little out of reach 
Or the girl living next door
I'll be your angel giving up her wings 
If that's what you need 
That's what you need 
I could be your favorite blue jeans 
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer 
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little out of reach 
Or the girl living next door
I'll be your angel giving up her wings 
If that's what you need 
I'd give everything to be your anything
