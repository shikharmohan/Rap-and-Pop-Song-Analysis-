In the heat of the fight, I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying, trying to make me stay
I said this time I've had enough
And you've called a hundred times, but I'm not picking up
'Cause I'm so mad, I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer
I said leave, but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
And don't you leave, 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door
Me and my stupid pride, sitting here alone
Going through the photographs, staring at the phone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door and all the things that I misread
So baby, if you know everything, tell me why you couldn't see
When I left, I wanted you to chase after me
I said leave, but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
And don't you leave, 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door
And I scream out the window I can't even look at you, I don't need you
But I do, I do, I do
I'll say there's nothing you can say to make this right again
I mean it, I mean it, what I mean is
I said leave, but baby all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
And don't you leave, 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door
With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess
After everything and that little black dress
After everything, I must confess
I need you
