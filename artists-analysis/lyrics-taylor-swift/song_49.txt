He is sensible and so incredible
and all my single friends are jealous
he says everything I need to hear and it's like
i couldn't ask for anything better
he opens up my door and i get into his car
and he says you look beautiful tonight
and i feel perfectly fine
but i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
and it's 2am and i'm cursing your name
you're so in love that you act insane
and that's the way I loved you
breakin' down and coming undone
it's a roller coaster kinda rush
and I never knew I could feel that much
and that's the way I loved you
he respects my space
and never makes me wait
and he calls me exactly when he says he will
he's close to my mother
talks business with my father
he's charming and endearing
and I'm comfortable
but i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
and it's 2am and i'm cursing your name
you're so in love that you act insane
and that's the way I loved you
breakin' down and coming undone
it's a roller coaster kinda rush
and I never knew I could feel that much
and that's the way I loved you
he can't see the smile I'm faking
and my heart's not breaking
cause I'm not feeling anything at all
and we were wild and crazy
just so frustrating intoxicating 
complicated, got away by some mistake and now
but i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
and it's 2am and i'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
and that's the way I loved you
breakin' down and coming undone
it's a roller coaster kinda rush
and I never knew I could feel that much
and that's the way I loved you oh, oh
and that's the way I loved you oh, oh
never knew I could feel that much
and that's the way I loved you
