Any day now
They're talking war
I can see the light that's in your eyes
They're not talkin
A week or two
Oh daddy can I go with you
Oh daddy can I go with you
You pack a suitcase
And take a picture from the wall
I always knew this time would come
When I ask how long
You think you're gonna be 
You say "Eh, this crazy world's come undone"
Summer's over
And leaves begin to fall
And another winter's on the way
I knew I wasn't gonna take this very well
But I'd give everything to have you here today
Everyday now
They're talking war
I know this time has been 
Like its never been before
We're not talking
About a week or two
Oh daddy can I go with you
Oh daddy can I go with you
Oh daddy can I go with you
