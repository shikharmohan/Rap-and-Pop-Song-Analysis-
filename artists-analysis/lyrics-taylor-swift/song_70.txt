I never saw it coming
the look in your eyes, showed me no surprise
you walked me to the front door and said
I love you and I'd never break your heart
you were so perfect 
you really lead me on
and gave me everything i ever wanted
(Chorus:)
Going out for dinner every night 
Cuddling while were watching our favorite movies 
going out to the football games
and then talking till sunrise
you gave me this and put me down 
I really thought we would improve
but you were the one, the one 
that i fell for
(Chorus)
You were the one 
that lead me on 
so here i go 
i hope shes worth it 
(Chorus)
Oh Oh Oh  
You were unperfect
