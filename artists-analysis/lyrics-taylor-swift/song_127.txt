I've never gone with the wind
Just let it flow
Let it take me where it wants to go
Till you open the door
There's so much more
I've never seen it before
I was trying to fly
But I couldn't find wings
Then you came along
And you changed everything
You lift my feet off the ground
Spin me around 
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I
I'm lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, 
Crazier, crazier
Watched from a distance as you
Made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know
How that would feel
And you made it so real
You showed me something that I couldn't see
Opened my eyes and you made me believe
You lift my feet off the ground
Spin me around 
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I
I'm lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, 
Crazier, crazier, oh
Baby, you showed me what living is for
I don't want to hide anymore
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around 
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I
I'm lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, 
Crazier, crazier
Crazier, crazier
