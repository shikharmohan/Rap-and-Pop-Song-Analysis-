Wish I had concentrated.
They said love was complicated, but it's something I just fell into.
And it was overrated, but just look what I created.
I came out alive, but I'm black and blue.
Before you ask me if I'm alright think about what I have to do...
Wake-up and smell the break up.
Fix my heart, put on my make-up.
Another mess I didn't plan.
And I'll bet you thought you beat me.
Wish you could only see I got an "I Heart ?" written on the back of my hand.
I'd be fine if you just walked by,
but you had to talk about why you were wrong and I was right.
But I can't believe you made me sit at home, cry like a baby, wait right by the phone every night.
And now you ask about you and I, there's no you and I,
remember what you put me through I had to...
Wake-up and smell the break up.
Fix my heart, put on my make-up.
Another mess I didn't plan.
And I'll bet you thought you beat me.
Wish you could only see I got an "I Heart ?" written on the back of my hand.
And when you're home all alone at night,
you'll still wonder why you took everything I had, oh baby. 
I haven't thought about you and I, there's no you and I, and I know someday you will...
Wake-up and smell the break up.
Realize that we won't make up.
It didn't go the way you planned.
And you'll know you didn't beat me 
when you look down and see I got an "I Heart ?" written on the back of my hand.
Written on the back of my hand.
An "I heart ?".
Written on the back of my hand...
