Its too late baby
Theres no turning around
I got my hands in my pocket
And my head in the clouds
This is how I do
When I think about you
I never thought that you could break me apart
I keep a sinister smile and a whole in my heart
You wanna get inside
Then you can get in line
But not this time
Cuz you caught me off guard
Now I'm running and screaming
Will you be my hero
And I'll be your heroine
Do you know that your love
Is the sweetest sin
Oh ooh oh ooh
oh oh yeah
Oh ooh oh ooh
oh oh oh
oh ooh oh ooh 
oh oh yeah
