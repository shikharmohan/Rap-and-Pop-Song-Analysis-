Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behid your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
But sometimes we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need
And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you
And I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well it drives me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying to let you know
That what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you
Just a small town boy and girl
Living in a crazy world
Trying to figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
My secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all nobody gets me like you do
And you know everything thing about me
You say that you can't live without me
And I'm only up when you're not down 
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground 
It's like no matter what I do 
Well it drives me crazy half the time 
The other half I'm only trying to let you know 
That what I feel is true 
And I'm only me when I'm with you
When I'm with anybody else
It's so hard to be myself
And only you cant tell
And I'm only up when you're not down 
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground 
It's like no matter what I do 
Well it drives me crazy half the time 
The other half I'm only trying to let you know 
That what I feel is true 
And I'm only me when I'm with you
With you
Oh oh oh
Yeah
