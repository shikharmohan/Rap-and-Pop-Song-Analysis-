You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel somethin'
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted
Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away
No use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sittin' here thinkin' it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you
You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there lovin' you and washed them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you
Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away
No use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sittin' here thinkin' it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you
You never did give a damn thing, honey
But I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody
If I died, died for you, died for you
Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending give to a perfect day
Every smile you fake is so condescending
Counted all the scars you made
Now that I'm sittin her thinkin' it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you
