Elevator buttons and morning air,
Strangers silence makes me wanna take the stairs.
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares,
But right now my time is theirs.
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves. 
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you.
(Chorus)
So don't you worry your pretty little mind,
People throw rocks at things that shine
and life makes love look hard.
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours.
You never know what people have up their sleeves,
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me.
Lurking in the shadows with their lipgloss smiles,
But I don't care.
Cause right now you're mine. 
And you'll say
(Chorus)
Don't you worry your pretty little mind,
People throw rocks at things that shine
and life makes love look hard.
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours.
And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong and
Your hands are tough but they are where mine belong in.
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you.
Cause I love the gap between your teeth
and I love the riddles that you speak.
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
Cause my heart is yours.
(Chorus)
So don't your worry your pretty little mind,
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard.
Don't worry your pretty little mind,
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours
The stakes are high, the water's rough 
But this love is ours.
