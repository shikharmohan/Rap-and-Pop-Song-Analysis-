(talking)
wow its been at least 5 years since I've seen her. pfft its hard to believe
(start singing)
I cant believe its been that long, why didnt your call, why didnt you write. was it cause of him or was it just cause you dont love me anymore. you could have found some way o contact me.
(chorus)
But i know its not my falt 
once hes gone i know you'll start to come around
i know its his fault now, you should have told me sooner, i wouldnt have had to live my life this way
(sing softly)
Now that he's gone will i get to see you again
at least hear your voice again
I think its gonna workout this time around
we can be a family again not like before is gonna e different,
were gonna do lots of stuff togeather i think its gonna work out this time around not like before
(chorus)
but i know its not my fault 
once he's gone i know youll start to come around
i know its his fault now, you should have told me sooner I wouldnt have had to live my life this way cause i know its not my fault now
