I used to think that one day we'd tell the story of us,
And how we met 
And how the sparks flew instantly
And people would say they're the lucky ones 
I used to know my place was the spot next to you,
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on
Oh, a simple complication,
Miscommunications lead to a fallout,
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah
And I don't know what to say since a twist of fate,
When it all broke down
And the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now
Next chapter
How did we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes
And trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should have held me
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending,
Why are we pretending this is nothing? 
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud.
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah
And I don't know what to say since a twist of fate,
When it all broke down
And the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now
This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you said you'd rather love than fight
So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah
And I don't know what to say since a twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now
Now, now, now
And were not speaking,
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you
Like it's killing me?
And I don't know what to say since a twist of fate,
'Cause were going down
And the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now
The End
