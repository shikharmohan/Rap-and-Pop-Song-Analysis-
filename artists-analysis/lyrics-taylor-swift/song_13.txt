You're little hands wrapped around my finger
And, it's so quiet in the world tonight
You're little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming 
So, I tuck you in
Turn on your favorite night light
To you, everything's funny
You got nothing to regret
I'd give all I had, honey
If you could stay like that 
Oh, darling don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up 
Just stay this little 
Oh, darling don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up 
It can stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you, won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you 
Just try to never grow up, and never grow up 
You're in the car on the way to the movies
And, you're mortified
You're mom's dropping you off
At, fourteen there's just so much you can't do 
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
But, don't make her drop you off around the block 
Remember that she's getting older too 
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your PJ's getting ready for school
Oh, darling don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up 
Just stay this little 
Oh, darling don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up 
It can stay this simple
And no one's ever burned you 
Nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to 
Just try to never grow up 
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad get's home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said 
And all you're little brothers favorite songs 
I just realized everything I had is someday gonna be gone 
So, here I am in my new apartment 
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be 
So, I tucked myself in and turned my night light on 
Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up 
Oh, I don't wanna grow up 
Wish I'd never grown up 
Could still be little 
Oh, I don't wanna grow up 
Wish I'd never grown up 
It could still be simple 
Oh, darling don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up 
Just stay this little 
Oh, darling don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up 
It can stay this simple
 Won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And even you want to 
Please, try to never grow up 
Oh, whoa 
Don't you ever grow up 
Oh, whoa 
Never grow up 
Just never grow up
