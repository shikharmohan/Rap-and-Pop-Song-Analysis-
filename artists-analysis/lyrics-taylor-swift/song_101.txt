Your on the phone
With your girlfriend she's upset
She's going on about something that you said
She doesnt get your humor like I do
I'm in the room 
Its a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesnt like
And she'll never know your story like I do
'Coz she wears short skirts
I wear t-shirts
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what your looking for 
Has been here the whole time  
If you could see that 
I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along
So why cant you seeeeeeeee 
You belong with meeeeeee
You belong with me
Walk in the streets 
With you and your worn-out jeans
I cant help thinking this is how  it ought to be
Laughing on the park bench thinkin' to myself
Hey isn't this eaaaaaasyyyyy
And you've got a smile 
That could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while 
Since she brought you down
You say your fine
I know your better than that
Hey what your doing with a girl like that
Yeah she wears high heels
I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain
And I'm on the bleachers 
Dreaming 'bout the day 
When you wake up and find
That what your looking  for
Has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you seeeeeeee
You belong with meeeeeeeeeeeee
Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not of known
Babyyyyyyyyy you belong with meeeeeee
You belong with meeeee
Ooooooh I remember you drive into my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one that makes you laugh
When you know 'bout to cry
I know your favourite song
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong 
Think I know its with mee
Cant you see that I'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along 
So why cant you seeeeee 
You belong with meeeeeeee
Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not of known
Babyyyyy you belong with meee 
You belong with me
You belong with me
 
Have you ever thought just maybeeee
You belong with meeee
You belong with me
