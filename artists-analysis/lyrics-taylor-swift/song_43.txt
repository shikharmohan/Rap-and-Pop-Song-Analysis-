Here you are now, fresh from your wars
Back from the edge of time
And all that you were, stripped to the bone
I thought you'ÃÂ­d want to know
When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong into my arms
Breathless
Lay down your guns, too weak to run
Nothing can harm you here
Your precious heart, broken and scarred
Somehow you made it through
I only ask that you won't go again
When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong into my arms
Breathless, oh, breathless
So glad to see you smiling
So good to hear your laugh
I think that you've found you
Even missed yourself
I'm only asking this because
I think that truth be told
Oh, you'll never go again
Again
When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong into my arms
Breathless, breathless
