She said, 'I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky, the pretty lights'
'And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love
And our momma smiled and rolled their eyes'
And said, 'Oh, my, my, my'
Take me back to the house in the backyard trees
Said you would beat me up, you were bigger then me
You never did, you never did
Take me back when our world was one lot bad
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids, you and I, oh, my, my, my, my
Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we really fall in love
And our momma smiled and rolled their eyes
And said, 'Oh, my, my, my'
Take me back to the creek that's reaching dark
Two A.M, riding in your truck
Yet all I need is here next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
Slamming our doors instead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside 'til the morning light, oh, my, my, my, my
A few years ago when comin' around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
Then you looked at me, got down on one knee
Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came and our mommas cried
You said, 'I do' and I did too
Take me home when we met so many years before
Where we rock our babies on the very front porch
After all this time, you and I
When I'll be 87 you'll be 89
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky, oh, my, my, my
