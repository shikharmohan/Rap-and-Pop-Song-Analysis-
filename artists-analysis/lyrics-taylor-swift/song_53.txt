Spoken:
Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Ha, time for a little revenge
The story starts when it was hot
And it was summer
And I had it all
I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along
Got him alone
And let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say sabotage
I never saw it coming
Wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated
Just who I was dealing with
She had to know
The pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated
Just who she was stealing from
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does 
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
On the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind 
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better
Than revenge (revenge), ha
She looks at life like it's a party
And she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend
And she's so over it
I think her ever present frown
Is a little troubling
And she thinks I'm psycho
'Cause I like to rhyme her name with things, but
Sophistication isn't what you wear
Or who you know
Or pushing people down
To get you where you wanna go
Oh they didn't teach you that in prep school
So it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses
Gives you dignity
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does 
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
On the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind 
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better
Than revenge, ha ha
I'm just another thing
For you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him
But haven't you heard?
I'm just another thing
For you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him
But I always get the last word
Whoa
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does 
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
On the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind 
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better
Than revenge
And do you still feel like
You know what you're doing,
Cause I don't think you do
Oh
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing
I don't think you do
I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause
C'mon show me how much better you are
See you deserve some applause
Cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you can say sabotage
