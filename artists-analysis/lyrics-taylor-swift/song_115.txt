they donÃÂ¢€t think      our love will last. 
they say weÃÂ¢€re moving       much  to fast
just because our love is new. 
 doesnÃÂ¢€t mean it canÃÂ¢€t be true.
our love is young and so are we,
i love you and you love me,
but they donÃÂ¢€t believe us, 
causeÃÂ¢€ they donÃÂ¢€t know us, 
they donÃÂ¢€t know us we can see,
they wonÃÂ¢€t listen  to you and me,
instead of trying to change our plans,
why not give us a helping hand.
just like Juliette loved romeo,
sometimes others donÃÂ¢€t always know.
but they wonÃÂ¢€t help  us, 
cause they donÃÂ¢€t know us.
     chorus
why not give us a chance and see,
just how true our love can be,
they know you and they know me,
but they donÃÂ¢€t know us,
            . (music  turnaround)
they say  weÃÂ¢€re young  and love is blind,
we should give this some more time,
did they forget they were young like us,         
all we ask is a little trust.
we love each other canÃÂ¢€t they see
 isnÃÂ¢€t that the way itÃÂ¢€s supposed to be.
they know you --and they know me,
but they donÃÂ¢€ know us,
  music  intro
i hope  soon your folks and mine,
will get together and take the time,
and get to know us,
 really get to know us.
  why not give us a chance ÃÂ¢€  and  see
just how strong our love can  be.
they know you,    and they know me,
but they donÃÂ¢€t know us. 
  ooh     woo a  woo  owho  yeah 
they donÃÂ¢€t know us thatÃÂ¢€s for sure , 
weÃÂ¢€re not their   little children anymore.
just because our love is new,
doesnÃÂ¢€t mean   it canÃÂ¢€t be  true
why not give us a chance and see,
how true love is suppose to be,
they know you  and they know me,
but they donÃÂ¢€t know us..
yes they know you and they know me,
but they just  donÃÂ¢€t know us,
