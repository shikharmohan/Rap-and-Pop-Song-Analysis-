Let's watch the tide chase the waves onto the sand
I wonder if a broken heart feel the warmth on my hand
Don't wonder how a piece of driftwood could see more through his lifetime
Let's walk away the past through the smokey black nights
I've seen a million things
spoke a million words
now i only want to speak to you
Waiting for the words
counting every bird
there's nothing i'd rather do
on smokey black nights
Still through the haze i can make out constellations
I'll make one of you and me as we sit in the sand
And i saw that sunset gleamin as my eyes went wild
Let's walk away the past through the smokey black nights
I've played a thousand songs
sang a thousand words
now i only want to sing to you
Waited on a wire
starin at the fire
there's nothing i'd rather do
on the smokey black nights
Yeah
I've walked a thousand miles
smiled a thousand smiles
Now I only smile when I'm with you
Waiting for the words
counting every bird
there's nothing i'd rather do
on the smokey black nights
So walk with me
As the sweet wind dances
I'm writing a song for you and me
On the smokey black nights
