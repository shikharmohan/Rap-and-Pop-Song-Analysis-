We were both young when i first saw you
    I close my eyes
    and the flashback starts
    I'm standing there
    on a balcony in summer air
    See the lights,
    See the  party the ball gowns
    I see you make your way through the crowd
    and say hello
    little did I know
    That you were romeo you were throwing pebbles
    and my daddy said stay away from juliet
    and I was crying on the staircase
    begging you please don't go, and I said
    Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
    I'll be waiting all theres left to do is run
    you'll be the prince and i'll be the princess
    its a love story baby just say yes
    so i sneak out to the garden to see you
    we keep quiet because we're dead if they know
    so close your eyes
    lets escape this town for a little while
    cause you were romeo i was a scarlet letter
    and my daddy said stay away from juliet
    but you were everything to me
    and i was begging you please don't go and i said
    romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
    i'll be waiting all theres left to do is run
    you be the prince and i'll be the princess
    its a love story baby just say yes
    romeo save me, they try to tell me how to feel
    this love is difficult, but its real
    don't be afraid we'll make it out of this mess
    its a love story baby just say yes,
    Oh, oh
    I got tired of waiting
    wondering if you were ever coming around
    my faith in you was fading
    when i met you on the outskirts of town, and I said
    romeo save me i've been feeling so alone
    i keep waiting for you but you never come
    is this in my head, i don't know what to think
    he knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said
    marry me juliet you'll never have to be alone
    i love you and thats all I really know
    i talked to your dad go pick out a white dress
    its a love story baby just say yes
    oh, oh, 
    we were both young when i first saw you
