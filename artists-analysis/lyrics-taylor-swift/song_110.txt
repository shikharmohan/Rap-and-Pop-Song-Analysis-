You wake up, it's raining and it's Monday
Looks like one of those rough days
Time's up, you're late again, so get out the door
Sometimes you feel like running
Find a whole new life and jump in
Let go, get up and hit the dance floor
But when the lights go down it's the ending of the show
And you're feeling like you've got nowhere to go
Don't you know?
You can change your hair and you can change your clothes
You can change your mind, that's just the way it goes
You can say goodbye and you can say hello
But you'll always find your way back home
You can change your style, you can change your jeans
You can learn to fly and you can chase your dreams
You can laugh and cry but everybody knows
You'll always find your way back home
Your best friends, your little hometown
Are waiting up wherever you go now
You know that you can always turn around
Cause this world is big and it's crazy
And this girl is thinking that maybe
This life is what some people dream about
Cause when I'm feeling down and I'm all alone
I've always got a place where I can go
Cause I know
You can change your hair and you can change your clothes
You can change your mind, that's just the way it goes
You can say goodbye and you can say hello
But you'll always find your way back home
You can change your style, you can change your jeans
You can learn to fly and you can chase your dreams
You can laugh and cry but everybody knows
You'll always find your way back home
Where they know exactly who you are
Where the real you is the superstar
You know it's never too far away
You can change your hair and you can change your clothes
You can change your mind, that's just the way it goes
You can say goodbye and you can say hello
But you'll always find your way back
You can change your hair and you can change your clothes
You can change your mind, that's just the way it goes
You can say goodbye, you can say hello
But you'll always find your way back home
You can change your style, you can change your jeans
You can learn to fly and you can chase your dreams
You can laugh and cry but everybody knows
You'll always find your way back home
You'll always find your way back home
You'll always find your way back home
