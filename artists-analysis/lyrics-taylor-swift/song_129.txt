I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your war path
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind tryin' to get it back
Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you
It's all right, just wait and see
Your strangled lights are still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not what you've been
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent
Did some things you can't speak of
But at night you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then
Wasn't it easier in your firefly catchin' days
With everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful runnin' wild till you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you
It's all right, just wait and see
Your stranged lights are still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not what you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up too
Minds change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never to late to
Be brand new
It's all right, just wait and see
Your strangled lights are still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not what you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent
Lost your balance on a tightrope
It's never too late to get it back
