This melody is what your love means to me
I love you so much babe can't  you see
it is like a rainbow after the thunderstorm
your love aways kept me safe and warm,
You had to walk through that open door
I suddenly fell down to the floor
it hurt so much to live without you
I tried not to think about you
You were more than I ever had
my love for you still makes me glad
So please come back we could start anew
no more sitting around feeling blue
So come on, it wil be just me and you
Don't hesitate
It would be great 
it's not too late
lets celebrate!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
