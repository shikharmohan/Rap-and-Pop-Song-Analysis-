She acts like shes 5 years old
since its cold shes got her big coat on
I hear people laugh at her
i look up bored
and she cries and runs
We star throwing stuff at her and she tries to hide
this starts to get old
She hugs her legs
and we put her to sleep
im forced to take her home
And shes stupid to know why the trees change in the fall.
And i know that she is scared
of every little thing and all
She thinks snow whites house very near how dumb
but i know we had the worst day
ever today.
she starts acting like shes 13 and thinks everyone is mean
She starts crying
And i push her away
and cut her with my keys
and she starts to drive and drive until she found a town far enough away
And she sulks and walks and  tries to forget all our names
And she know if shes ever going to finish school
And she knows shell never laugh
cause we shrunk and she grew
she dont know how lng itll take to feel okay
but she knows she had the wors day ever today
She had a bullying father
She thought she was getting stronger
Her mom beats up her little brother
inside and out hes more popular than she is
She grew up in an ugly house
and had no space to run
and she had the worst days with me
there was a video i found from back when we were three
she was trying to paint in the kitchen and she was talking to me
it was the age of teasing and bullying and throwing eggs at her window
And her dad was super dumb 
and i was the most handsome boy
in the whole wide world
and now she knows why
all the trees change in the fall
and she knows i was never on her side
and always said she was wrong
and she hates me
for giving her the evil eyes
and making her feel like 
she could shine
and i dont know if she knew
so im taking this chance to say 
that i always have the worst days
when im with you.
