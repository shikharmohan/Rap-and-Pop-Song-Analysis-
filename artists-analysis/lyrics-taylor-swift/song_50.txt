one, two, three, four,
Before I know it, IÃÂ¢€m out the door
Five, six, seven, eight,
Oh, why, didnÃÂ¢€t I, wait?
Nine and ten, 
I sure do regret, then
Chorus:
Oh wait! 
For another chance
You need,
To take a risk
So hey,
Just wait!  Before it is too late,
Just take, a chance
So tell, me why,
It takes me time,
To wonder how,
How I got this far
But why, didnÃÂ¢€t I wait?
There was a chance, I needed to take!
Chorus:
Oh wait!
For another chance,
you need,
to take a little risk
So hey!
Just wait! Before itÃÂ¢€s too late
Just take, a chance
Bridge:
So imagine, what it would be like,
If we never took risks,
or we never had a chance
to
live
La la la la, la la la la la la, la la la la, la la la la ohh oh
Chorus:
Oh wait! 
For another chance
You need,
To take a risk
So hey,
Just wait!  Before it is too late,
Just take, a chance 
Ohh oh
