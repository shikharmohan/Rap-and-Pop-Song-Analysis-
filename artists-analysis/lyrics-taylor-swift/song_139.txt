hey
don't write yourself off yet
it's only in your head you feel left out or looked down on
just try your best
try everything you can
don't you worry what they tell themselves when you're away
it just takes some time
little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
everything everything will be just fine
everything everything will be all right, all right
hey you know they're all the same
you know you're doing better on your own, so don't buy in
live right now
just be yourself
it doesn't matter if it's good enough, for someone else
it just takes some time
little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
everything everything will be just fine
everything everything will be all right, all right (x2)
hey - don't write yourself off yet
it's only in your head you feel left out or looked down on
just do your best
do everything you can
don't you worry what their bitter hearts are gonna say
it just takes some time
little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
everything everything will be just fine, everything everything will be all right.
