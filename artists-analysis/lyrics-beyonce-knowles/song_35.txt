I'm so in love, I'm still in love
I never met love quite before
until I saw your face
and watching stars
without you my soul cries
my heathing heart is full of pain
when we're apart... the aching
[chorus]
I'm kissing you, oooh
I'm kissing you, oooh
your my father, you are my soldier,
you protect me, boy you save me, your my best friend, you're my husband
you are my doctor, counselor, provider, professor, my everything 
and I love you, I love you, I love you, yes I love you I..
I need you, I need you, I need you, I can't live without you
I trust you, I trust you with every ounce of me
just teach me, boy teach me,just take me
When we make love I can feel all your spirits deep inside of me yeahh
baby you're so pure
[chorus]
I'm kissing you, forever and ever and ever
I love kissing you (kissing you, kissing you, kissing you)
I love, everything about you baby
It's been so many years since we fell in love
we've got something special baby
we can cry together
we can grow together
be ourselves together
and I love you, more than music
Yes I love you, more than music
I rather be kissing you, oooh
I'm kissing you, oooh
kissing you
