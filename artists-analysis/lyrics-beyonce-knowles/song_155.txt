Shawty, what your name is?
Them hustlas keep on talkin'
They like the way I'm walkin'
You saying that you want me
So press record, I'll let you film me
On your video phone, make a cameo
Tape me on your video phone, I can handle you
Watch me on your video phone, on your video, video
If you want me, you can watch me on your video phone
I love how you approach me
Fresh white with your pants hangin' grown man low
Everything you sayin' soundin' good to me
No need to convince me anymore
Swag up, it's bright, one blade, it's tight
And I smell your cologne in the air
Baby you doin' something right
You just canceled every other man here
You say you like my bag and the color of my nails
You can see that I got it goin' on
I wanna make sure you remember me
So I'ma leave my number on your video phone
I got no time for frontin'
I know just what I'm wantin'
If it's gonna be you and me
When I call, they better see me on your video screen
Them hustlas keep on talkin'
They like the way I'm walkin'
You saying that you want me
So press record, I'll let you film me
On your video phone, make a cameo
Tape me on your video phone, I can handle you
Watch me on your video phone, on your video, video
If you want me, you can watch me on your video phone
You a cutie
You should let me put you in my movies
Do shoot into a star of your own hit song
We can shoot the video right here on my cellphone
I never seen a smile so pretty
I need to know I'll always have you wit' me
So take your picture on my video phone
You can pick your own song and you could be the only one
I know you like that
Turn you into a star, I got it like that
Baby don't fight it 'cause when I miss your call
I hit you right back on my video phone
Them hustlas keep on talkin'
They like the way I'm walkin'
You saying that you want me
So press record, I'll let you film me
On your video phone, make a cameo
Tape me on your video phone, I can handle you
Watch me on your video phone, on your video, video
If you want me, you can watch me on your video phone
You know them G's, they be hollerin', 'specially them hot ones
Brooklyn, Atlanta, Houston to New Orleans
When they see me they be like, yo B let me call you
You breakin' my focus boy, you cute and you ballin'
You like it when I shake it?
Shawty on a mission, what your name is?
What, you want me naked?
If you liking this position, you can tape it on your video phone
Hustla keep on talkin'
You like the way it's popping?
You saying that you want me
Press record, baby film me
On your video phone, make a cameo
Tape me on your video phone, I can handle you
Watch me on your video phone, on your video, video
