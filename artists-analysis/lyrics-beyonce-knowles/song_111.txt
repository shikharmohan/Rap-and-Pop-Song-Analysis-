I like to feel so high and
you feel good feeling low
I like my colours vivid
and you paint your colours gold
I like to see the world and you like your weekends home
but I've been tagging behind while you refused to go
Chorus:
'Cause you're such a burden
but you're the weight off of my shoulders
'Cause even though I'm hurting
it still feels like it's time I'm growing
When I thought that we'd grow up and grow together the same time
guess I passed you by at that old "Stop" sign
At that old "Stop" sign
You like to sleep all day and I like my minutes long
I like trips to the movies you watch TV all night long
I like to go out dancing and you go out just to hang
And I've been right beside you losing me and doing the same
Chorus:
'Cause you're such a burden
but you're the weight off my shoulders
'Cause even though I'm hurting
it still feels like it's time I'm growing
When I thought that we'd grow up and grow together the same time
guess I passed you by at that old "Stop" sign
At that old "Stop" sign
I looked around and baby you were gone 
Where did I lost you honey
I even slowed down thought you'd follow
But you took your own roads honey
'Cause I've been travelling travelling travelling 
only to find that I'm making this trip alone
And I've been staying behind while you refused to go
Chorus:
'Cause you're such a burden
but you're the weight off my shoulders
'Cause even though I'm hurting
it still feels like it's time I'm growing
When I thought that we'd grow up and grow together the same time
guess I passed you by at that old "Stop" sign
At that old "Stop" sign
