Verse 1-
I always loved you, even though did me wrong
I always stayed by your side, I guess I was your fool
I always cared, there's no one above you
I swear, cheated on me now she's there 
Pre-Chorus- 
She won't answer your calls, don't wanna be bothered at all
I guess I'll be the one standing with open arms
Sucka for love, kisses too
Ya touch, I'm crazy for you
Chorus-
I'll settle for you, yes I will be the one who will
Settle for you, yes I will be the one you run to
You come running to, yes I will be the one who will
Settle for you, settle for you
Verse 2- 
I can never leave you, no matter how hard I try
You'll probably do it again, I'll still be right here waiting
Nothing has changed, it remains, the same, I can't explain
Pre-Chorus
Sucka for love, ya kisses too
Ya touch, I'm crazy for you
Chorus-1x
Bridge-
Even when the chips are down, I'll still settle for you
You'll probably hurt me again, I'll still settle for you
I know I must be the world's greatest fool 
(repeat)
I'll still settle for you
Chorus- 1x
Ad-libs- 
I will always love you no matter how hard I try
Probably do it again I'll still be here waiting
Stuck with you, in love with you, here for you, loving you
Settling for you baby yea
