I know you've heard I'm a gangsta
They say stay away from them gangstaz
They never change up, or pull they pants up
Well, baby girl, put ya foot down, don't let 'em push you around
You know what you like
Baby thug, you know wrong from right
You done felt grown before this can't be what it feel like
And they don't really know whatcha feel like, for instance
They don't know the difference between real life
And the music videos and the raggedy magazines
They have it badder than he seems
All they see is my baggy jeans, my attitude
I ain't mad at you, it's just my Clyde
Way I wear my hat to the side
Way I lean real low when I ride
That's why my minds, they like my walk
My accent from New York
My way of thinking is slightly off
They like the way he floss
Leave the block on a bike, he come back on a Porsche
But of course
Most of all, they like my honesty, integrity, my loyalty
