No shorty, it's Beyonce
We gon' party like, it's ya birthday
We gettin' naughty like, it's ya birthday
So put ya drink up in the air if you feel sexy
I'm the chick with the hotish, Manolo Blahnik
Jimmy Choo kicks, killin' it, who you with?
Me and my girls at the party with the diamond Zinati's
I'm that classy mami with the Marilyn Monroe body
I'm that fly chick 5'6 Marc Jacob mini
Ghetto fabulous, glamorous, it's effortless
Make up light, we with my pastel Louis
Designer scarf, work of art, rockin' vintage Pucci
You can find me in the club, sippin' on some bub
Daddy I got what you need you's a sexy little thug
Don't wanna be your girl I ain't lookin for no love
So come give me a hug, sexy little thug
You can find me in the club, sippin' on some bub
Daddy I got what you need you's a sexy little thug
Don't wanna be your girl I ain't lookin' for no love
So come give me a hug, sexy little thug
My nails, my hair, my diamond rings
Shining, with all my fancy things
My crib, my car, my clothes, my jewels
Why you mad? 'Cause I came up and I ain't changed
I'm that girl wearing Chanel pearls
Chandeliers in my ears from Bailey, Banks and Biddle
Ya feelin' my style, ya feelin' my flow
Hair chic, smells sweet, like coke to flow
I'm the lady sipping Baileys while I strut like a model
If the ladies wanna hate me I just send them a bottle
I know I got it but don't flaunt it even though brothas want it
Dancin' dirty while I'm flirtin', 'cause he checkin' up on me
You can find me in the club, sippin' on some bub
Daddy I got what you need you's a sexy little thug
Don't wanna be your girl I ain't lookin' for no love
So come give me a hug, sexy little thug
You can find me in the club, sippin' on some bub
Daddy I got what you need you's a sexy little thug
Don't wanna be your girl I ain't lookin' for no love
So come give me a hug, sexy little thug
My nails, my hair, my diamond rings
Shining, with all my fancy things
My crib my car my clothes my jewels
Why you mad? 'Cause I came up and I ain't changed
You can find me in the club, sippin' on some bub
Daddy I got what you need you's a sexy little thug
Don't wanna be your girl I ain't lookin' for no love
So come give me a hug, sexy little thug
