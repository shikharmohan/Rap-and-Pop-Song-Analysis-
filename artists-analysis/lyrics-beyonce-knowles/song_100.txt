You don't care about me at all
You treat me like dirt all the time
what do I have to do
oh baby your not my boo
chorus:
cause you treat me like a girl with no name
I wonder if it'll be the same
why can't you call me Beyonce
or is it that your not happy 
cause i'm a girl with no name
Why are we together and we don't talk to eachother
why do you call me baby
I told you my name is beyonce
so thats all I have to say
Chorus:
you treat me like a girl with no name
I wonder if you'll be the same
will you love me for ever for life
will you ask me to be your wife 2x
cause i'm just a girl with no name
a girl with no name
so baby!
call me by my name please!
I wonder if you want to be
my......
baby boo
you treat me like a girl with no name
I wonder if you'll be the same 
I try so hard to let it go
but you made me wanna go home
cause i'm just a girl with no name
cause i'm just a girl with no name
i'm just a girl
with no name
( she's just a girl with no name)
its over
