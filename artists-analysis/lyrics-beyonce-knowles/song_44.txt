I wish I could believe you
Then I'll be alright
But now everything they told me
Really don't apply
To the way I feel inside
Loving you was easy once upon a time
But now my suspicions of you are multiplying
And it's all because you lied
I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forgive this
But I'm much too full of resentment
Just can't seem to get over the way you hurt me
Don't know how you gave another
Didn't mean a thing, no
The very thing you gave to me
I thought I could forgive you
And I know you've changed
As much as I wanna trust you
I know it ain't the same
And it's all because you lied
I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forgive this
But I'm much too full of resentment
I may never understand why
I'm doing the best that I can, and I
I tried and I tried to forgive this
And I'm much too full of resentment
I'll always remember feeling
Like I was no good
Like I couldn't do it for you
And your mistress could
And it's all because you lied
Loved you more than ever
More than my own life
The best part of me I gave you
Yeah, I would sacrifice
And it's all because you lied
I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I tried and I tried to forgive this
But I'm damn too full of resentment
I know she was attractive
But I was here first
Been riding with you for six years
Why did I deserve
To be treated this way by you, you?
I know you're probably thinking
What's up with B?
I've been crying for too long
What did you do to me?
I used to be so strong
But now you took my soul
I'm crying, can't stop crying
Can't stop crying
You could've told me you wasn't happy
I know you didn't want to hurt me
Look what you've done to me now
I gotta look at her in her eyes
And see she's had half of me
How could you lie?
