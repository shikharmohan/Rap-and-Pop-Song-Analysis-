I'ma be like a jolly rancher that you get from the corner store
Now I'ma be like a waffle cone that's dripping down to the floor
The way you do if for me I can't lie, about to be up in the mall all night
Whatever I get you putting it on, don't give me no lip let mama do it all
Let me be, I wants to be, gots to be
Your suga, give mama some suga mama
Suga ma-ma-mama
Suga mama, suga mama
Let me be, I wants to be, gots to be
New whip, new heavy on the wrist
'Cause I'ma suga ma-ma-mama
I'm your suga mama, suga mama
Hey, hey, sit on mama lap
Hey, hey, come sit on mama lap
Hey, come sit on mama lap
Hey, hey, come sit on mama lap
Hey
It's so good to the point that I'd do anything to keep you home
Baby what you want me to buy, my accountant's waiting on the phone
Just the thought of making love to you
Dropping everything that's what I'll do
Whatever I get you putting it on, now take it off while I watch you perform
Let me be, I wants to be, gots to be
Your suga, give mama some suga mama
Suga ma-ma-mama
I'm your suga mama, suga mama
Let me be, I wants to be, gots to be
New whip, new heavy on the wrist
'Cause I'm a suga ma-ma-mama
I'm your suga mama, suga mama
'Cause I'm a suga ma-ma-mama
I'm your suga mama, suga mama
Hey, hey, sit on mama lap
Hey, hey, come sit on mama lap
Hey, come sit on mama lap
Hey, hey, come sit on mama lap
Hey
And I have always been the type to take care of mine
I know just what I'm doing
Don't you worry it's cool and everything is steady
Puttin' you on my taxes already, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I promise I won't let no bills get behind
'Cause every touch, every kiss and hug
You best believe it'll be on time
Suga mama
Let me be, I wants to be, gots to be
Your suga give mama some suga mama
Suga ma-ma-mama
I'm your suga mama, suga mama
Let me be, I wants to be, gots to be
New whip, new heavy on the wrist
'Cause I'm a suga ma-ma-mama
I'm your suga mama, suga mama
Hey, hey, sit on mama lap
Hey, hey, come sit on mama lap
Hey, come sit on mama lap
Hey, hey, come sit on mama lap
Hey, hey, sit on mama lap
Hey, hey, come sit on mama lap
Hey, come sit on mama lap
Hey, hey, come sit on mama lap
