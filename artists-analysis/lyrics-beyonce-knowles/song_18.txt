2nd verse:
can we take it there, cause they're about to close give me one more dance then I'm ready to go, well the dj's playing all the same songs and the night's about to end, can we meet, in the parking lot, find a quiet place were we can talk, to find out more about each other, baby can we?
Repeat Pre-chorus and Chorus
Bridge:
You know I'm feelin you tonight,
So let's find a certain spot to go
Where we can get to know each other better
I'll go and tell my girls
You go and tell your boys
Before we leavin' tell me whats it' gon' be (repeat 1x)
Chorus until fade
