You know I hate sleepin' alone
But you said that you would soon be home
But baby that was a long time ago
I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it
On top of you not callin' me back
You see I bet you think it's all on track
And you actin' like it's all a dat
I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it
Let's go, let's go little Kitty Kat
I think it's time to go, let's go little Kitty Kat
He don't want no mo', let's go little Kitty Kat
Quite frankly, no mo' gettin' it, I'm not feelin' it
It's like we at two places but different paces
We in trouble but you won't meet me at the bridge
It hurts and feels discernin'
Did you forget where joy lives?
What about my body, body?
You don't want my body, body
Actin' like I'm not nobody
You gon' make me call somebody
What about my body, body?
What about my body, body?
You would rather go and party
Somehow, somewhere I'll be naughty
You know I hate sleepin' alone
But you said that you would soon be home
But baby that was a long time ago
I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it
On top of you not callin' me back
You see I bet you think it's all on track
And you actin' like it's all a dat
I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it
Let's go, let's go little Kitty Kat
I think it's time to go, let's go little Kitty Kat
He don't want no mo', let's go little Kitty Kat
Quite frankly no mo' gettin' it, I'm not feelin' it
  (Let me show you how to get there)
Take a left to compassion, lights will be flashin'
Keep straight and you'll see the sign right there
Affection, you're in the wrong direction
If I get caught see it just seems that you don't care
What about my body, body?
You don't want my body, body
Actin' like I'm not nobody
You gon' make me call somebody
What about my body, body?
What about my body, body?
You would rather go and party
Somehow, somewhere I'll be naughty
You know I hate sleepin' alone
But you said that you would soon be home
But baby that was a long time ago
I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it
On top of you not callin' me back
You see I bet you think it's all on track
And you actin' like it's all a dat
I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it
Let's go, let's go little Kitty Kat
I think it's time to go, let's go little Kitty Kat
He don't want no mo', let's go little Kitty Kat
Quite frankly no mo' gettin' it, I'm not feelin' it
I'm takin' back the things I got from you, you
And that includes my sweet little nooky too, too
Let's go, let's go little Kitty Kat
He don't want you anymore, no
Let's go, let's go little Kitty Kat
He don't want you anymore, no
Got diamonds on my neck, got diamonds on my records
Since 16 I was comin' down ridin' Lexus
How you gon' neglect this? You is just a hot mess
You can call Tyrone, you ain't gots to lie Craig
What about my body, body?
You don't want my body, body
I'm in the house all alone
You rather go and party?
What about my body, body?
You don't want my body, body
Actin' like I'm nobody
You gon' make me call somebody
Let's go, let's go little Kitty Kat
I think it's time to go, let's Go little Kitty Kat
He ain't want no mo', let's go little Kitty Kat
No mo' gettin' it I'm not feelin' it
