[Incomprehensible]
I wish I could look in your eyes
And tell you how I feel right now inside
Baby I know that it's real, so real, so real, so real
How I wish I could be with you
How I wish, how I wish, how I wish I could be with you right now
Every morning, every afternoon, every night, I wanna be with you
It don't matter if we go to the park or watch a play
Stay in the hotel room all day, I just wanna be with you
I love everything about you from your old school tennis shoes
To the way you move when you're dancing with me
Do you remember our first kiss, it wasn't long enough
Remember the first time we spent those weeks together
They were not long enough all of our conversations
All of your sweet pages, they're never long enough
When it's time for me to leave, it's so hard to say goodbye
I never wanna say goodbye, I never ever wanna say goodbye
One day we'll make love, finally I'll be yours
Only you, only you, I could love you
It's too late I already love you
I love you, I love you, I love you
