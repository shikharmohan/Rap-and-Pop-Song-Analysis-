The cards never lie, my last breath a sigh
And now I think about if it's my time to die
I don't know what I was thinking, steady wasting time with Hill
And I need to live my life because my time is unforgivable
I can't understand how my life changed around
Manifest my destiny, is it the brown on the grown?
Blue skies are turning gray it's the point of indecision
Leaving in the car and much be spent on television
Oh girlfriend, get your mind on right
Don't spend your time 'cause you can't waste your time
Everyday like it's your last but you must feed the mind
Intervention comes and snatch up all your dreams from behind
Love, you feel it and you got to let them know it
Love, your heart and that's the feeling that you go with
If you have a dream you need to go and let them know it
'Cause you could wake up in the morning and it could be over
No, no, no, no
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna go
Just, just, just let me stay home
Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn
No, no, no, no
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna go
Just, just, just let me stay home
Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn
Carmen, don't listen 'cause the cards have deceit
Just slide him the money, we don't need a receipt
Truth only exists within the eyes of the beholder
Plus he's kind of young for fortune telling
He probably should be older
But the cards never lie, I thought I told you
Now it's her turn to try, to reach her goals
Before she reaches the light
This is love
It's like I'm trying to throw my life away
Sometimes love is all you got
And other times it makes you pay
Well, when you finally rise
Then you'll realize
The windows to the soul are not the hips but the eyes
Oh you could wish on the stars but they dead, just a lie
But they shine just as bright as they did their entire life
No, no, no, no
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna go
Just, just, just let me stay home
Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn
No, no, no, no
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna go
Just, just, just let me stay home
Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn
