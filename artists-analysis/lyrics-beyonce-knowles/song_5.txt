Feels like I'm losing my mind
Love is so hard to find
You led me on to believe, you belong to me
oohh ooohh
I'm going trough difficult times
I always thought you were mine 
Love doesn't feel like this, this is my final wish
The next time your truck rolls by
No matter how hard I cry
Please don't stop in front of me
Cause your loves no longer sweet
The next time I bring you change
Baby please pull back ya hand
You know your not what I need
Let me go, let me do B
(2x) You've got me chasing after you like a ice cream truck, I try my luck and catch up, but it's always out of luck
Faster and faster I ran
You sped up and then
Just as I thought I've caught up
I'm chasing you again
Finally,
You stopped and I jumped on
I realized your flavor was wrong
You thought I was still holding on
It's good to know your gone
The next time your truck rolls by
No matter how hard I cry
Please don't stop in front of me
Cause your love's no longer sweet
The next time I bring you change
Baby please pull back ya hand
You know your not what I need
Let me go, Let me do B
(2x) You've got me chasing after you like a ice cream truck, I try my luck and catch up, but it's always out of luck.
