(VERSE 1)
Its really being weighing on me
Tell me what did i do 
To have yall hatin on me
When i dont have nothin to prove
Sometimes i shake my head when im laying down in my bed
Thinking about the things being said when you really dont know me
 
(HOOK)
Gotta clear up somethings there have been many things said about me
So many opinions so many judgements preconceived
It's outta my character for me to feed in to ya,give it a rest
You must admire me spend so much time with me consuming your head
 
(CHORUS)
I cant take nomore
Think its time for me to let it all out
I cant take nomore
Why my name always up in your mouth
What you hate me for
Im so tired all of these lie
I cant take nomore nomore nomore
 
(VERSE 2)
Its really been weighing on me
Im not myself lately
I feel a little incomplete 
But im not gon loose no sleep
I keep it all in my mind
Cause it gotta get better in time
Why dont you live your life and let me live mine
 
(HOOK)
 (CHORUS)
You,you,you dont know (repeat 4xs)
 
(CHORUS)(repeat 2xs)
Leave me alone,leave me alone
Just leave me alone,leave me alone
Just leave me alone,leave me alone
Just leave me alone,leave me alone
