Diamonds used to be coal
Look young 'cause they got soul
That's why they're beautiful
And my heart used to be cold
Till your hands laid on my soul
Baby, that's why you're beautiful
I'm not wondering why the sky's blue
That's not my business
All I know is I look up and tell myself
Be patient, love that could be us
Lovers used to make love
And die just to give us
Their piece of the beautiful
Remember when we made love?
Love, wasn't it beautiful?
Don't ask me why the sky's blue
That's not my business
All I know is I look up and tell myself
Be patient, love that could be us
Diamonds used to be coal
Look young cause they got soul
That's why they're beautiful
And my heart used to be cold
Till your hands laid on my soul
Baby, that's why you're beautiful
Somebody's got to stay deep in love
That could be us, that's why we're beautiful
That's why you're beautiful
Ooh, why? Why?
That's why you're beautiful
That's why you're beautiful
That's why you're beautiful
