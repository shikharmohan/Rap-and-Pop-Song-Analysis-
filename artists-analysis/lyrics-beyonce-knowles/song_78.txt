I remember, when you used to take me
On a bike ride every day, on the bayou
  (Remember that? We were inseparable)
And I remember when you could do no wrong
You come home from work and I jump in your arms when I saw you
  (I was so excited)
I was so happy to see you, ooh
  (So happy to see you)
Because you loved me, I overcome, yeah
And I'm so proud of what you've become, yeah
You've given me such security
No matter what mistakes I make, you're there for me
You cure my disappointments
And you heal my pain
You understood my biz and you protected me
I treasure every year in place a comemory
And that's why, I want my unborn son
To be like, my daddy
I want my husband to be like, my daddy
There is no one else like, my daddy
And I thank you for lovin' me
Daddy daddy, daddy daddy
Daddy daddy, daddy daddy
Daddy daddy, daddy daddy
Daddy daddy, daddy daddy
I still remember the expression on your face
When you found out I'd been on a date and had a boyfriend
  (My first boyfriend, you shoulda seen your face)
I still remember, I called you cryin'
'Cuz of my tattoo, coulda said, "Beyonce, I told ya so"
Instead you said you'd get one too
  (You and my momma said ya'll get one just like mine)
Words can't express my boundless gratitude for you
I appreciate what you do, ohh
You've given me tight security
No matter what mistakes I know, you're there for me
You killed my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understood by biz and you protected me
I treasure every extraordinary memory, that's why
My unborn son to be like, my daddy
I want my husband to be like, my daddy
There is no one else like, my daddy
And I thank you for lovin' me
Even if my man broke my heart today
No matter how much pain I'm in, I will be okay
'Cause I got a man in my life that can't be replaced
For this love is unconditional, it won't go away
I know I'm lucky, know it ain't easy
For men who take care of their responsibilities
Love is overwhelming, Lord why did you pick me?
Can't stop my tears from falling, I love you so much daddy
([Inaudible] to be like my daddy)
(Thank you, you've done so much for me, I love you, daddy)
  ([Inaudible] to be like my daddy)
I get so emotional daddy, every time I think of you
  (There is no one else like my daddy)
I get so emotional daddy, every time I think of you
  (I thank you)
There is no one else like my daddy
  (There is no one else like my daddy)
No one else replace my daddy
