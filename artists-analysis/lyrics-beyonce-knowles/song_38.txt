Took me a while but I'm finally here
So I just wanna testify, make it crystal clear
See I've been picked out to be picked on
Talked about, out my friends mouths
I've been beat down 'til He turned my life around
Seems like I always fall short of being worthy
'Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me
I ain't no superstar, the spotlight ain't shining on me
'Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me
I used to wake up somedays
And wish I'd stayed asleep
'Cause I went to bed on top of the world
Today the world's on top of me
Now everybody's got opinions
They ain't been in my position
That it breaks my heart
When I hear what they have to say about me
Seems like I always fall short of being worthy
'Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me
I ain't no superstar, the spotlight ain't shining on me
'Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me
And I'm not perfect
Yes I do wrong
I'm trying my best
But it ain't good enough
Shunned by the world
If I don't succeed
'Cause I ain't good enough
But He still loves me
If you ain't worthy just raise your hands
And let me know that you understand
That we are all so blessed to be loved, loved
Stand for him or fall for anything
'Cause through his eyes we all look the same
What will we do without pain?
Seems like I always fall short of being worthy
'Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me
I ain't no superstar, the spotlight ain't shining on me
'Cause I ain't good enough but He still love me
I'm not perfect
Yes I do wrong
I'm trying my best
But it ain't good enough
Shunned by the world
If I don't succeed
'Cause I ain't good enough
But He still loves me
I'm not perfect
Yes I do wrong
I'm trying my best
But it ain't good enough
Shunned be the word
If I don't succeed
'Cause I ain't good enough
But He still loves me
No, I ain't good enough
But He still loves me
No, I ain't good enough
But He still loves me
No, I ain't good enough
But He still loves me
No, I ain't good enough
But He still loves me
  (But the Lord still loves me)
