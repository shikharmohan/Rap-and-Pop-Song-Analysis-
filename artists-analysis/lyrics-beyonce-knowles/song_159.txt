You're holding me and I close my eyes
You're whispering, and I start to cry
You feel so good, so beautiful
For as long as you live don't let me go
Just hold me, touch me, feel me
As long as you love me, reach for me and need me
If you could trust me, and teach me, never let go of me
Becasue you're half of me, my heart still beats
I'm looking in the eyes, the eyes of love
And I hold your face and I see the sun
I taste your kiss, you touch my soul
and I'm feeling things I've never felt before
Just hold me, touch me, feel me
As long as you love me, reach for me and need me
If you could trust me, and teach me, never let go of me
Because you're half of me my heart still beats
I'm feeling what they call pure love
I never knew feeling like this could exist inside of me 
I'm soaring, emotions exploding
I don't want to live another day if you're not here with me
Just hold me, touch me, feel me
As long as you love me, reach for me and need me
If you could trust me,  teach me, never let go of me
Because you're half of me my heart still beats
because you're half of me my heart still beats
