I gotta give up 
to quite the storm that rages inside
the way that I hit my damage part
you gave me away
And I've had enough
I imagine the words I say to you
I'm finding strange to follow it trough
I'm ready to change
I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, We're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our souls
So let it show, so let it show
We can pretend, we can pretend
We only find ourselves by loosing all
Control (x8)
I'm opening it up
show me a sign I can't relieve 
It's crazy emotions flow trough me
I'm gonna explode
You take me away
and what is my ordinary life
I wont be afraid of what we might find a love I can hold
I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, We're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our souls
So let it show, So let it show
We can pretend, we can pretend
We only find ourselves by loosing all
Control
Nothing injured nothing gained
New horizon ready to play
with every breath you take it away
I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, We're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our souls
So let it show, So let it show
We can pretend, we can pretend
We only find ourselves by loosing all
Control (x8)
