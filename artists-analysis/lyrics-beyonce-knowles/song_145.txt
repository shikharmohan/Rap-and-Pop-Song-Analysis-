you say that he's wrong
you say that he's no good
leave em alone 'cause he's gonna hurt you
but what they don't know is how he makes me feel
you say that he creeps
always runnin' the streets
he's playing the game
and he'll never love me
you say that he's fake but why does it feel so real
Hook
no matter what you say i ain't goin no where
no matter what you think i will always be there
the love that we share it lives inside of me
no matter what you hear it's all in the past
no matter what you feelin this love is gone last
the heart of his soul it breeds inside of me
Chorus
My man, he makes me feel so special
My man, he makes me feel so precious
My man, he makes me feel wonderful
My man, with him I'm so comfortable
My man, he makes me feel so special
My man, he makes me feel so precious
My man, he makes me feel wonderful
He's thugged out but he's my man
Verse
you say you don't trust em

but you were young once so you should understand

until you can show me i'm gone stand by him
Hook
no matter what you say i ain't goin no where
no matter what you think i gon always be there

no matter what you hear it is all in the past
no matter what you feelin this love is gone last
the heart of his soul it breeds inside of me
Chorus
My man, he makes me feel so special
My man, he makes me feel so precious
My man, he makes me feel wonderful
My man, with him I'm so comfortable
My man, he makes me feel so special
My man, he makes me feel so precious
My man, he makes me feel wonderful
He's thugged out but he's my man
Chorus 
My man, he makes me feel so special
My man, he makes me feel so precious
My man, he makes me feel wonderful
My man, with him I'm so comfortable
My man, he makes me feel so special
