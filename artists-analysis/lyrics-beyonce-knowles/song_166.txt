He is always laughin' and flirting with me
And you act like you don't even care
As a matter of fact you've been real distance lately
Actin' like I'm not even there
He says that you don't deserve a girl like me
I'm startin' to think that he's right
Baby, if you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
If this happen
Then it proves that your was never true
If you let him take me from you, baby
If you let him take me from you
Why is that, when we go out
Out together as one big crew
I tried to chill with you, dance or whatever
And your homeboy is more interested than you
He pays more attention to me than you lately
I'm tended to pay attention too
Baby, if you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
If this happen
Then it proves that your was never true
If you let him take me from you, baby
If you let him take me from you
Boy, when I tried to show some affection to you
You act like you got better things to do
You want some lovin' that's when it's cool
But, baby boy, I'm not a fool
Baby, if you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
(Wanted me)
If this happen, then it proves that your was never true
(No, no, no, how could you let him take your woman)
If you let him take me from you, baby
If you let him take me from you
(How you gonna let him take me from you)
If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
No, no, you never wanted me
If this happen, then it proves that your was never true
(Just, let me go, let me go, just let me know)
If you let him take me from you, baby
If you let him take me from you
If you let him take me from you
