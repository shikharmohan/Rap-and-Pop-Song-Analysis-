Bass, uh
Hi hat, uh
808, uh
Jay, uh-huh
Ready? Uh huh
Let's go get 'em, uh huh
C'mon!
I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass, hi hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag B
(Boy you hurtin' that)
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now I be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me whippin' curtains back
Me and B, she about to sting, stand back
Baby, seems like everywhere I go
I see you, from your eyes, your smile
It's like I breathe you, helplessly I reminisce
Don't want to compare nobody to you
Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go, oh
You know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's dÃÂ©jÃÂ  vu
You know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's dÃÂ©jÃÂ  vu
Seeing things that I know can't be, am I dreaming?
When I saw you walking past me almost called your name
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
Feels like I'm losing it
Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go, oh
You know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's dÃÂ©jÃÂ  vu
You know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's dÃÂ©jÃÂ  vu
Yes! Hova's flow so unusual
Baby, girl you should already know
It's H-O, light up the strobe
'Cause you gon' need help tryna study my
Bounce, flow, blow, what's the difference?
One, you take in vein, while the other you sniffin'
It's still dough, po-po try to convict him, that's a no-go
My dough keep the scales tippin' like 4-4's
Like I'm from the H-O-U-S-T-O-N
Blow, wind so Chicago of him
Is he the best ever? That's the argument
I don't make the list, don't be mad at me
I just make the hits, like a factory
I'm just one-to-one, nothin' after me
No dÃÂ©jÃÂ  vu, just me and my, oh!
Baby, I can't go anywhere
Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having dÃÂ©jÃÂ  vu
'Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next plane, I don't care
Is it because I'm missing you
That I'm having dÃÂ©jÃÂ  vu?
Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go, whoo!
You know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's dÃÂ©jÃÂ  vu
You know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's dÃÂ©jÃÂ  vu
I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's dÃÂ©jÃÂ  vu
You know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's dÃÂ©jÃÂ  vu
