I love you
I love you
I love you
Baby, I love you
You are my life
My happiest moments weren't complete
If you weren't by my side
You're my relation
In connection to the sun
You next to me
There's no darkness I can't overcome
You are my raindrops
I am the seed
You and God, who's my sunlight
I bloom and grow so beautifully
Baby, I'm so proud
Proud to be your girl
You make the confusion go all away
From this cold and misty world
I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing
Called life without you, here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just, just keep lovin' me
The way I love you, lovin' me
'Cause I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing
Called life without you, here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me
The way I love you, lovin' me
And I know you love me
Love me for who I am
'Cause years before I became who I am
Baby, you were my man
I know it ain't easy
Easy lovin' me
I appreciate the love and dedication
From you to me
Later on in my destiny
I see myself havin' your child
I see myself bein' your wife
And I see my whole future in your eyes
Thought of all my love for you
Sometimes make me wanna cry
Realize all my blessings
I'm grateful to have you by my side
I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing
Called life without you, here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just, just keep lovin' me
The way I love you lovin' me
'Cause I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing
Called life without you, here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me
The way I love you, lovin' me
Every time I see your face
My heart smiles
Every time it feels so good
It hurts sometimes
Created in this world
To love, to hold
To feel, to breathe
To live you
Dangerously in love
Can't do this thing
I love you , I love you, I love you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me
I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
I cannot do
I cannot do anything without you in my life
Holdin' me, kissin' me, lovin' me
Dangerously
Dangerous
Dangerously in love with you
Oh, I love you
I love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, I love you
Oh yes, I love you
I love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love with you
Love you
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
Dangerously in love
