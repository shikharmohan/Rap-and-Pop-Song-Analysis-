Remember those walls I built
Well baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I've got my angel now
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
hatit I can see you halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything we need and more
It's written all over you face
haiti we can feel your halo
Pray it won't hide away 
I can see your halo... halo...) halo
(I can see your) halo... (halo...) halo-o
(I can feel your) halo... (halo...) halo-o-o
(I can see your) halo... (halo...) halo... uhoo
Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest nights
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like fallin'
Gravity came again
To pull me back to the ground again
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out
Everywhere we looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
haiti I can see you halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything we need and more
It's written all over you face
haiti I can feel your halo
Pray it won't hide away
I can feel your halo... halo...) halo
(I can see your) halo... (halo...) halo-o
(I can feel your) halo... (halo...) halo-o-o
(I can see your) halo... (halo...) halo
(I can feel your halo [uhoo] halo...) halo
(I can see your) halo... (halo...) halo-o
(I can feel your) halo... (halo...) halo-o-o
(I can see your) halo... (halo...) halo... uhoo
Halo uhooo

uhoo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo oo oo
Everywhere I'm looking now

Haiti I can see you halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything we need and more
It's written all over you face
hatit I can feel your halo
Pray it won't hide away
