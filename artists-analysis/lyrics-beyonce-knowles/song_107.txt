Hello hello baby you called
I can't hear a thing
I have got no service
In the club, you see? see?
Wha-wha-what did you say huh?
You're breakin' up on me
Sorry I cannot hear you
I'm kinda busy
K-kinda busy
K-kinda busy
Sorry I cannot hear you I'm kinda busy
Just a second
It's my favorite song they're gonna play
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh?
You shoulda made some plans with me
You knew that I was free
And now you won't stop calling me
I'm kinda busy
Stop callin'
Stop callin'
I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin'
Stop callin'
I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephonin'
Me eh, eh, eh,eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh,
I'm busy eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh,eh, eh
Stop telephonin'
Me eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh,
Can call all you want but thereÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½s no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cuz I'm out in the club
And I'm sippin that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Call all but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Cuz I'm out in the club
And I'm sippin' that bubb 
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Boy the way you blown up my phone
Won't make me leave no faster
Put my coat on faster
Leave my girls no faster
I shoulda left my phone at home
'Cuz this is a disaster
Calling like a collector
Sorry, I cannot answer
Not that I don't like you
I'm just at a party
And I am sick and tired of my phone r-ringing
Sometimes I feel like I live in Grand Central Station
Tonight I'm not takin' no calls
'Cuz I'll be dancin'
Cuz I'll be dancin'
Cuz I'll be dancin'
Tonight I'm not takin' no calls
Cuz I'll be dancin'
Stop callin
Stop callin
I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dancefloor
Stop callin
Stop callin
I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dancefloor
Eh,eh,eh,eh,eh,eh,eh,eh,eh,eh, eh
Stop telephonin
Me eh,eh,eh,eh,eh,eh,eh,eh,eh,eh
I'm busy eh,eh,eh,eh,eh,eh,eh,eh,eh,eh
Stop telephonin
Me eh,eh,eh,eh,eh,eh,eh,eh,eh,eh
Can call all you want but there's no one home
