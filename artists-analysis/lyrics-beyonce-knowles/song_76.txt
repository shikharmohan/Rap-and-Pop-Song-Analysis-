Feel like i'm loosing my mind
Love is so hard to find
You led me on to believe you belong to me
oh oh
Im going through difficult times
I always thought you were mine
Love doesnt feel like this
This is my final wish
Hook:
The next time your truck rolls by
No matter how hard I cry
Please dont stop in front of me
Cause your loves no longer sweet
The next time I bring you change
Baby please pull back your hand
You know your not what I need
Let me go Let me do B
Chorus:
You've got me chasing after you like an 
ice cream truck 
I try my luck and catch up but
it always out of luck
(and my heart just melts)
You've got me chasing after you like an 
ice cream truck
i try my luck and catch up but
its always out of luck
(and mt heart just melts)
Verse 2:
Faster and faster I ran
You sped up and then
Just as I thought I've caught up
Im chasing you again
Finally 
You stopped and I jumped on
I realized the flavor was wrong
you thought i was still holdin on
Its good to know whats goin on
hook:
The next your truck rolls by
No matter how hard I cry
Please dont stop in front of me
Cause your loves no longer sweet
The next time I bring you change
Baby please pull back your hand
You know your not what I need
Let me go Let me do B

You've got me chasing after you like an
