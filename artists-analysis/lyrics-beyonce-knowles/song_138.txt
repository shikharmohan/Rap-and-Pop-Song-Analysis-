Here I am looking in the mirror
An open face, the pain erased
Now the sky is clearer, I can see the sun
Now that all is, all is said and done, oh
There you are always strong when I need you
You let me give and now I live
Seriously and protected with the one I will love
After all is, all is said and done
I once believed that hearts were made to bleed
(Inside I once believed that hearts were made to bleed, oh baby)
But now I'm not afraid to say
I need you, I need you so stay with me
These precious hours
(Precious, yeah)
Greet each dawn in open arms
And dream, into tomorrow
Where there's only love
After all is, all is said and done
(Yeah baby)
Oh baby
(Inside I once believed, that hearts were meant to bleed)
(I'll never)
I'll never be afraid to say
I need you, I need you, so here
So here we are in the still of this moment
Fear is gone, hope lives on
We found our happy ending
For there's only love
(Only love)
And this sweet, sweet love
After all is, all is said and done
Yeah baby, after all is
(All is)
All is said and done
