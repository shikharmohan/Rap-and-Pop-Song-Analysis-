Oh I know that you treat me right
but still I think I gotta make you my next ex
I'm on to the next
and I think you're nice, but I saw something else that I like
And I think I gotta make you my next ex
I'm on to the next Oh
[Verse 1]
Today when I wake up
You didn't look the same as last night
And it just don't feel right anymore
I think that we should break up
There's no reason to make up
I won't fight, I'm just tired and I need a change
[bridge1]
Sorry boy but you got me bored and something's catching my eye
I was only satisfied for a little while (I gotta switch him out switch him out switch him out switch him out) Kick him out kick him out kick him out kick him out

Oh I know that you treat me right

[Verse 2]
You call me to frequently
I thought it was so sweet
In the beginning
But now you're too clingy for me
You don't put the seat down
You don't clean the house how
I like it (trifling)
That's reason enough, your time's expired
[bridge2]
Sorry boy but you got me bored I gotta move around
If I ain't gotta ring by now that means I'm not tied down (I gotta switch him out switch him out switch him out switch him out) Kick him out kick him out kick him out kick him out
