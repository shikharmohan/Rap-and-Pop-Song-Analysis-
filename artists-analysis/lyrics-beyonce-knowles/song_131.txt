When I First met u
U told me exactly how it would be
U had a lady 
And couldn't spend all ur time with me
I only wanted to kick it
So i said boo u can keep her
Long as u satisfy me
But as the weeks went by
I, I started feeling strange
Sumthin was deep in my heart
Sumthin I can't explain
I think I'm fallin in love with u boy
I'm needin u so much 
I'm cryin just 2 feel ur touch
I gotta leave u
I didn't wanna a man
I didn't wanna fall in love and
I didn't care about ur girl
I didn't care how we would end up
But that was then this is now
I think i'm experiencing love
I don't wanna wreck up ur home
That's y i'm convinced 
I gotta go

Every time she calls u expect
Me 2 dissapear like we never met
At first i didn't mind
But now i, sumtimes feel like ur all mine
U told me it was all about me, me, me
It's not about me if ur still with her
Now i realized that i gotta move on
It might be hard but, i 
I gotta move on
