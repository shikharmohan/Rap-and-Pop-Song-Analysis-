Do you think you could fall for a woman like me?
Cause I find it hard to trust, I need to much, and I really don't believe in Love (No No)
Do You think that I could be the girl of your dreams?
Sometimes I don't let things go, get emotional, and sometimes i'm just outta control.
You need to stop for a minute.
Before you get to deep up in it (Too Deep)
Everything ain't what it seems.
It's hard lovin a woman, a woman like me.
You need to think about it.
Before you get hooked on a venom and can't live without it (No No NO).
Can't believe everything you see.
It's hard lovin a woman, a woman like me.
Do you think that I could be the one that you see?
Cause baby i'm one step ahead
Your two steps behind, but baby I don't mind
Do you think that I could make you real happy, baby?
Just don't get me wrong
My lovin is so strong, but I ain't trying to lead you on
You need to stop for a minute.
Before you get to deep up in it (No NO)
Everything ain't what it seems. (Seems)
It's hard lovin a woman, a woman like me. (Woman Like Me)
You need to think about it.
