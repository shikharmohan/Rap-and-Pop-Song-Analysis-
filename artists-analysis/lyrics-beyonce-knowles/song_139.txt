Out of all the guys that approach me
Walking up to me like they know me
You were the one that stayed aside
Waited awhile and took your time
You don't know how impressing
Your curiosity was to me
It was the fourth day of July
Looked in my eyes and saw that I
I wanted more than just a man, I needed a friend
Someone I can talk to, someone who really listens
When you touched my hand, the sun got brighter then
Trusting you, I closed my eyes and felt our love begin
It was the summertime
When we fell in love it was the summertime
Heaven shined on us it was the summertime
Baby, there is nothing like the summertime, summertime
Now it's been a year and were closer
Fall in love again when I hold ya
I know that God set you aside for me
And now you are my prize
Wanna grow old witcha
And fill our house with your pictures
Have a son for you, a little girl for me
Together we'll raise a family
Baby, you're more than just a man, you are my best friend
Someone I can talk to someone who really listens
When you touched my hand the sun got brighter then
Trusting you I closed my eyes and felt our love begin
It was the summertime
When we fell in love it was the summertime
Heaven shined on us it was the summertime
Baby, there is nothing like the summertime, summertime
It was the summertime
When we fell in love it was the summertime
Heaven shined on us it was the summertime
Baby, there is nothing like the summertime, summertime
