Satellites flashing by
It's a beautiful state we're in
But how can we love in isolation?
Think how happy we can be when we just try
When nothing like we seem
Passionate words are never spoken
You don't know how I bleed
When I leave your side
In your eyes, love's alive
You've come untied
'Cause we're flashing by
Like satellites, satellites
Take all the rules away
How can we live if we don't change?
We're always on display
Let's run and hide
In our eyes, love's alive
We've come untied
'Cause we're flashing by
Like satellites, satellites
If we don't communicate
We'll exist in our own space
We have all the love we need
While we're apart I cannot breathe
Satellites flashing by
Satellites
