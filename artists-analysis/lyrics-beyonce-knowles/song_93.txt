You're all alone 
And I did this
I've got 
No one else to blame
You didn't know 
I was a risk
And it's such 
A crying shame
How you gave me 
All of you
And wanted 
Nothing else from me
But to make 
Some time for you
But all I made you 
Was lonely
I couldn't see
But I know
That I acted 
Selfishly
I shoulda known
That I let you down
Caused you 
So much misery
Forever to bleed (5x)
I shoulda been there (4x)
All of the times
You used to cry
Because 
I would let you down
I'm losing time
I shoulda tried
A little more 
To be around
But I didn't know 
That you were hurting
I was just to blind
Only thing 
I know for certain
Another you 
I'll never find
I couldn't see
But I know
That I acted selfishly
I shoulda known
That I let you down
Caused you 
So much misery
Forever to bleed (5x)
I shoulda been there (4x)
I'm through 
With regret
I'm gonna tip 
And soak myself 
In misery
Now in yo life
I'll take more time
No more yearning 
Without me
But it hurts 
To think of you 
All by yo self
But now I see
And I apologize 
Ffor all the times
I left you home 
Waiting for me
I couldn't see
But I know
That I acted 
Selfishly
I shoulda known
That I let you down
Caused you 
So much misery
Forever to bleed (4x)
(2x)
I'm gonna be there 
(I'm gonna be there)
I'm gonna be there 
(I'm gonna be there)
I'm gonna be there 
(I'm gonna be there)
I'm gonna be there
Uh, oh, uh, oh 
Uh, oh, uh 
Ohhhhhhhh
