If I were a Boy
even just for a day
i'd roll out of bed in the morning
and throw on what I wanted and go
drink beer with guys
and chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
and I'd never get confronted for it
cuz they'd stick up for me
If i were Boy
I think I could understand
how it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
Cuz I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cuz he's taking you for granted
and everything you had got destroyed
If i were a boy
I would turn off my phone
tell everyone its broken 
so they'd think that I was sleeping alone
I'd put my self first
and make the rules as I go
cuz I know that she'd be faithful
waiting for me to come home (to come home)
If I were Boy
I think I could understand
how it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
Cuz I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cuz he's taking you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
Its a little too late for you to come back
its just a mistake to think I'd forgive you like that
if you thought I would wait for you
 you thought wrong
But your just a boy
you don't understand (yeah,you don't understand)
how it feels to love a girl
somedays you wish you were a better man
you don't listen to her
you don't care how it hurts
until you lose the one you wanted
cuz you've taken her for granted
and everything you had got destroyed
but your just a boy..
