I think that we should break up
There's no reason to make up
I won't fight, I'm just tired and I need a change
Sorry boy, but you got me bugging, something's catching my eye
I was only satisfied for a little while
I gotta twitch him out, twitch him out, twitch him out, twitch him out
Kick him out, kick him out, kick him out, kick him out
