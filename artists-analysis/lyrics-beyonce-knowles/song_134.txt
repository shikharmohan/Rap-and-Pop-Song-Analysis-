Oh baby, oh baby, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
I love the way you make me feel
It slows down time
Come in my bedroom
And turn off the lights
You whisper softly in my ear
Makes me unwind
The way you touch me
Lets me know you're mine
I'd rather be with you
'Cause I love the way you scream my name
And there's no other man that gives me
What I want and makes me feel this way
I'd rather be with you
'Cause you hustle hard to take care of me
I'd rather be with you
I know, I'd rather be with you
I love the way you look at me
Stare into my eyes
What do they say to you?
Boy, don't be shy
Tonight's the night your fantasies
Will all come true
I am your woman
I belong to you
There is nothing I won't do for you
I know my soul connected me to you
I feel so safe when I'm alone with you
I'm holding back nothin', saving it all for you
Baby, I love making love to you
It's like a high, I can't come down from you
I'd rather be with you
'Cause I love the way you scream my name
And there's no other man that gives me
What I want and makes me feel this way
I'd rather be with you
'Cause you hustle hard to take care of me
I'd rather be with you
I know, I'd rather be with you
I'd rather be with you, oh yeah
Boy, I rather be with you
I'd rather be with you, oh yeah
Boy, I rather be with you
I'd rather be with you
'Cause I love the way you scream my name
And there's no other man that gives me
What I want and makes me feel this way
I'd rather be with you
'Cause you hustle hard to take care of me
I'd rather be with you
I know, I'd rather be with you
I'd rather be with you
'Cause I love the way you scream my name
And there's no other man that gives me
What I want and makes me feel this way
I'd rather be with you
'Cause you hustle hard to take care of me
I'd rather be with you
I know, I'd rather be with you
