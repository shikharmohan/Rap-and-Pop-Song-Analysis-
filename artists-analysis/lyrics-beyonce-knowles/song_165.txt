Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting ooh
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
It's 6 o'clock
and seconds feel like hours as I sit here
and watch them tick away
And just the thought
of seeing you again I wanna sing
I've been longing for this day
I'll be waiting
'cause I cant smile untill I see your smile
I'll be waiting
there's nothing else that I would rather do
I'll be waiting
'cause I can't sleep until I hear your heart
I'll be waiting
'cause patiently I'll wait right here for you
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Patiently I'll wait right here for you
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Patiently I wait
It's 12 am
the crowd is getting thin but it's okay
'cause I ain't here for them
No no no
And I refuse
to move from where I am
until I feel your heart
pressed against mine again
I'm waiting!
I'll be waiting
'cause I cant smile until I see your smile
I'll be waiting
there's nothing else that I would rather do
I'll be waiting
'cause I can't sleep until I hear your heart
I'll be waiting
'cause patiently I'll wait right here for you
I don't care how long it takes
I don't mind I'm alright I'll sit and wait
'til the sun comes down and rise
and come right back up again
You're the best thing that's happened in my life
When your aps in the bar is in my life
and it just aint right
So take as long as you like
I'm waiting
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting (4x)
I'm waiting
I'll be waiting
I cant smile until I see your smile
I'll be waiting
There's nothing else that I would rather do
I'll be waiting
'cause I can't sleep until I hear your heart
I'll be waiting
'cause patiently I'll wait right here for you
I'll be waiting
I can't sleep until I hear your heart
I'll be waiting
There's nothing else that I would rather do
I'll be waiting
'cause I can't sleep until I hear your heart
I'll be waiting
'cause patiently I wait right here for you
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Patiently I wait right here for you
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Patiently I wait
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
