How ya doin', hug me, baby
You know I don't ask for much
But for a girl spendin' time alone
Can be pretty rough
But I get a knock on my door
You know it's yours for sure
We can't wait for the bedroom
So we just hit the floor
Is y'all alright
I don't know but I know
What's happened to me, girl, hey
Is y'all alright
Break it down now
He gotta work it out
He gotta work it out
A brother gotta work it out
Chad, blow your horn now
Come on, Chad, blow your horn now
So we're shakin' back and forth now
Just keep it comin', babe
Treat my body like a guitar
You gotta, you gotta keep on strummin'
But in the back of my mind
Is it gonna be the last time?
Well, if it ain't about eleven
And you gon' keep it comin'
Well baby, with me that's fine
Is y'all alright
I don't know but I know
What's happened to me, girl
Is y'all alright
Break it down now
He gotta work it out
He gotta work it out
Brother gotta work it out, oh, oh
Chad, blow your horn now
Come on, Chad, blow your horn now
I like this, ooh, ooh, hey
Look-a here, bring it
So baby, hold me
Like you don't wanna let go
I'm feelin' sexy
'Cause boy, you're workin' it out
My love, you've given me a taste of your honey
I want the whole beehive
I'm gonna call you my sugar to fly high
The sweetest time, wait, the time
You gotta work it out
You gotta work it out
Oh, you gotta work it out
I like it when you hold your own
I like it when you hold your own
I like it when you hold your own
I like it when you hold your own
Austin, better work it out
Foxxy, better work it out
AP3, better work it out
AP3, better work it out
