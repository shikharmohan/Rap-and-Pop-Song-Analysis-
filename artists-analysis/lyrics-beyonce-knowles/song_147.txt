All the ladies if you feel me
Help me sing it out
I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive of me to think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of one day havin' your kids
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong
I can't believe I fell for your schemes, I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women
It took me sometime but now I moved on because I realized I got
Me, myself and I, that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out and there ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gon' be my own best friend
Me, myself and I, that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out and there ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gon' be my own best friend
Controlling to say that you love me but you don't
Your family told me one day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know I'm dealing with your three kids in my home
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong
Now that it's over, stop callin' me, come pick up your clothes
Ain't no need to front like you're still with me, all your homies know
Even your very best friend try to warn me on the low
Took me some time but now I am strong because I realized I've got
Me, myself and I, that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out and there ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gon' be my own best friend
Me, myself and I, that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out and there ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gon' be my own best friend
Got me, myself and I
(I know that I will never disappoint myself)
I must have cried a thousand times
(All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out)
I can't regret time spent with you
(Yeah, you hurt me but I learned a lot along the way)
So I have vowed to make it through
(After all the rain you'll see the sun come out again)
All I've got me, myself and I
(I know that I will never disappoint myself)
I must have cried a thousand times
(All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out)
I can't regret time spent with you
(Yeah, you hurt me but I learned a lot along the way)
So I have vowed to make it through
(After all the rain you'll see the sun come out again)
Got me, myself and I
(Me, myself and I)
I must have cried a thousand times
(I have cried so many times)
I can't regret time spent with you
(I can't regret time spent with you)
So I have vowed to make it through
(After all the rain you'll see the sun come out again)
Got me, myself and I
(I know that I will never disappoint myself)
I must have cried a thousand times
(If you cried a thousand times, ladies, you will survive)
I can't regret time spent with you
(Yeah, ya hurt me but I learned a lot along the way)
So I have vowed to make it through
(I can see the sun shine, I can't be myself and I)
