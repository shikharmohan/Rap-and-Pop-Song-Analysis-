You got me
You got me
You got me
You've got me speechless
Where you been lately
Waited for you all day
Waited for you to use the key
That opens my place
My heart starts trembling
As I hear your footsteps pace
Lock opens, doorknob turns
There appears your face
Going out my head, I think I'm losing all my mind
Drive me crazy, burning candles, making love all night
Feels so strange, it feels so crazy to be in your world
In your arms, loss for words, you've got me
You got me
You got me
You got me
You've got me speechless
Laying so closely
I feel your skin rubbing and touching me
Only sweat between us
Feeling you kissing and pleasing me
I rub your back, I kiss your neck
I know that you love when we touch like that
I can feel you need me
Feels so good to me, feels so good to me
Going out my head, I think I'm losing all my mind
Drive me crazy, burning candles, making love all night
Feels so strange, it feels so crazy to be in your world
In your arms, lost for words, you've got me
You got me
You got me
You got me
You got me speechless
Yes, yes, yes
Yes, yes, yes
Speechless, all I can say is
Yes, yes, yes
All I can say is
Yes, yes, yes, yes
Kiss me, hold me
You got me speechless
