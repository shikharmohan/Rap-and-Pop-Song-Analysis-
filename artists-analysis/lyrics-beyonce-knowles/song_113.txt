I wanted to give all of my fans something extra
Because this album was so special to me
And it came so effortlessly after I finished
The film of my life 'Dreamgirls'
Because I was so inspired by Deena
I wrote songs that were saying all the things
I wish she woulda said in the film
And I wanted to give you an extra special song
That Deena sings, it's a pivotal moment
When Deena finally does get the strength to stand up for herself
And does know who she is, and knows what she wants
I'm sure all of you women can relate to the lyrics
This is Listen
