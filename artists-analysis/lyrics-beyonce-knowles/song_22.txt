Beyonce you can do so much better 
[Verse]
You say that he's wrong
You say that he's no good
Leave him alone 
'cause he's gonna hurt you
But what they don't know is how he makes me feel
You say that he creeps
Always running the streets
He's playing the game
And he'll never love me
You say that he's fake
But why does it feel so real
[Pre-Chorus]
No matter what you say I ain't goin no where
No matter what you think I'ma always be there
The love that we share it lives inside of me
(The love that we share it lives inside of me)
No matter what you hear-ing, its all in the past
No matter what you feel-ing his love is gon last
The heart of his soul it breathes inside of me
(The heart of his soul it breathes inside of me)
[Chorus]
He's my man
(He makes me feel so special)
My man
(He makes me feel so precious)
My man
(He makes me feel wonderful)
My man
(With him I'm so comfotable)
My man
(He makes me feel so special)
My man
(He makes me feel so precious)
My man
(He makes me feel wonderful)
He's thuged out but he's my man
[Verse]
You say you don't trust him
Be'cause he's been locked up
You say he in trouble
'cause he out in a strip club
But you were young once 
So you should understand
You say that you know
Say you've been a witness
You say it's for sure
Say he got a mistress
Until you can show me
I'm gon stand by him
[Pre-Chorus]
No matter what you say I ain't goin no where
No matter what you think I'ma always be there
The love that we share it lives inside of me
(The love that we share it lives inside of me)
No matter what you hear-ing, its all in the past
No matter what you feel-ing his love is gon last
The heart of his soul it breathes inside of me
(The heart of his soul it breathes inside of me)
[Chorus]
He's my man
(He makes me feel so special)
My man
(He makes me feel so precious)
My man
(He makes me feel wonderful)
My man
(With him I'm so comfotable)
My man
(He makes me feel so special)
My man
(He makes me feel so precious)
My man
(He makes me feel wonderful)
He's thuged out but he's my man
