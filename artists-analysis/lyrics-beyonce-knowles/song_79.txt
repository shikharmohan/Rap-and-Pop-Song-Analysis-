Something told me 
It was over
when I saw you 
And her talking
Something deep 
Down 
In my soul said 
"Cry Girl"
When I saw you 
And that girl 
Walking out
I would rather 
I would rather 
Go blind boy
Than to see you 
Walk away 
From me chile
Ooooo 
So you see 
I love you 
So much
That I don't want 
To watch you 
Leave me baby
Most of all 
I just don't 
I just don't want 
To be free no
I was just 
I was just 
I was just 
Sitting here 
Thinking
Of your kisses 
And your 
Warm embrace 
Yeah
When 
The reflection 
In the glass 
That I held 
To my lips now 
Baby
Revealed 
The tears 
That was 
On my face 
Yeah
And baby, baby 
I would rather 
Be blind boy
Than to see you 
Walk away 
See you 
Walk away 
From me, yeah
Baby, baby, baby 
I'd rather be 
Blind now
