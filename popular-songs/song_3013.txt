You sure know what you're doing holding me this way
And I'll go where you lead me, anywhere you say
You've got me where you want me, so darling please be kind
Before you take it all and I make that final fall
You've got to keep in mind
I'm a new fool at an old game
A kid out of school, trying to find my way
I don't know the rules, so teach me how to play
I'm just a new fool at an old game
Maybe I'm a dreamer or maybe I'm naive
But when you say you love me
I start to believe that coal can turn to diamonds
And this night will never end but if it isn't so
And I cry when you go, you've got to understand
That I'm a new fool at an old game
A kid out of school, trying to find my way
I don't know the rules, so teach me how to play
I'm just a new fool at an old game
