Last night, I got served a little bit too much of that poison, baby
Last night, I did things I'm not proud of and I got a little crazy
Last night, I met a guy on the dance floor
And I let him call me, baby
And I don't even know is last name
My momma would be so ashamed
It started of, "Hey cutie, where you from?"
Then it turned into, "Oh no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know his last name
He left the club about around 3 o'clock in the morning
His Pinto is sitting there in the parking lot when it should of been a warning
I had no clue what I was getting into, so I blame it on the crevol
Oh, where did my manners go?
And I don't even know is last name
My momma would be so ashamed
It started of, "Hey cutie, where you from?"
Then it turned into, "Oh no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know his last name, oh, here we go
Today I woke up thinkin' bout Elvis, somewhere in Vegas I'm not sure
How I got here or how this ring on my left hand just appeared
Outta nowhere, I gotta go, take the chips and the Pinto and hit the road
They say what happens here stays here
All of this will disappear, but there's just one little problem
And I don't even know is last name
My momma would be so ashamed
It started of, "Hey cutie, where you from?"
Then it turned into, "Oh no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know his last name
What have I done, what have I done, what have I done
Oh, what have I done, I don't even know my last name
And it turned into, "Oh no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know my last night
It started of, "Hey cutie, where you from?"
Then it turned into, "Oh no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know his last name
