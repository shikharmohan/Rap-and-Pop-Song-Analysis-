(robert john jones, jerry tayler)
We wouldn't have to meet here
In this dark secluded place
To hide our faces
If I had it my way
You wouldn't have to say goodbye
Then driving home dream up another alibi
If I had it my way
There'd be no more wrong numbers
When I call you on the phone
And she's there
And I wouldn't have to worry
She might find a moonlit strand of my hair
If I had it my way
Love would not be touch and go
We'd lie here in the afterglow
Till the break of day
If I had it my way
You would not keep leaving me
Love would not be misery
You would always stay
If I had it my way
Repeat verse #1
Repeat verses #4 and #5
