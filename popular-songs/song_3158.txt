A stallion
Ass like pow
Chest like bang
Lips like, ooh
An angel mane
But she had the devil's eyes
I had to have her cat
Pass me the one, fifty one and coke cat
Then later we'll find where the dope at
But hold that
I seen somethin' so fat
That wish I could've drove back
To get my Codac
Strip teeasa!
Lovin' who got the visa
Got up and she will please ya
Not of then she don't need ya
Product Gucci Felecia
It's a duty to feed ya
Amnesia
Caribou and Tequezia
Off the turnbuckle, baby, bubba had the booties and boobies
It was nootie, so cootie was a cutey
I gotta get neara
I got mucho dinero
Look at her, look at herself in the mirror
Movin' like Shakira
Made my way
To the front of the stage
Hundreds for days
Big body, I wanted to praise
Will she get with a nigga? Maybe
She bent over and said thanks and I whispered in her ear
I love the way you make it slither, baby
Every night when I come through
That looks like somethin' that I want to run through
You want some, ooh
You know I want to
Baby, we can have fun too
I love the way you make it slither, baby
Every night when I come through
That looks like somethin' that I want to run through
You want some, ooh
You know I want to
Baby, we can have fun too
I love the way you make it slither, baby
Well, she asked me for a lap dance
And Trav said she too fine, fat chance
Boy I'm Tech N9ne I rap and
I slap hands
With millionaires, plus, I got stacks man
She approached me slowly
Holy moly
Chef Boy R Dee's cheese and beef ravioli
Hold me close
Nose be ope
How much evil can dough provoke
How much she told me nope
'Cause this one was on her
I'm hopin' I can get the chance to put it on her
She slithered on me, put the booty in my lap and got to gyratin'
Was I waitin'
For the pushin' grabbin' and vibratin'
But this is really when my pupils got to dilatin'
What kind of magical hocus pocus was I facin'
Over and over I tried to explain it the best that I could
She put the mouth on the crotch of my pants and said
Herrrrrh!
Shit
You like that baby?
How about me and you leave here baby
So we can do that shit you just did
Over and over again
I love the way you make it slither, baby
Every night when I come through
That looks like somethin' that I want to run through
You want some, ooh
You know I want to
Baby, we can have fun too
I love the way you make it slither, baby
Every night when I come through
That looks like somethin' that I want to run through
You want some, ooh
You know I want to
Baby, we can have fun too
I love the way you make it slither baby
Said she needed four hundred to tip out
I whip out
The grip so quick, so we can dip out
The trick house
Told my homies not to poke they lip out
I'm goin' to rip out
The guts, and try to throw my hip out
Now it's time to trip out
Got at the bitch house
Was three fine female roommates, my homies missed out
Took me to her room and threw me right on the bed
Got right on the head
What a wonderful night it was said
Then along came three
Thirty six double D's
Sizes kissin' and lickin' on me
An' they comin' to do what
Wake my dude up
But one of them bitches bit me on the neck and drew blood
Then the other and the others
Instead of bud lovers
I'm trapped with blood suckin' motherfuckers for eternity
Brought me here to straight feed on a nigga
All because I said to a stripper
I love the way you make it slither
