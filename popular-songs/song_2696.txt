Stuck at a red light outside an adult bookstore
His son said, "Daddy, what are all those X's for?"
As the light turned green he changed the subject fast
Started talkin' 'bout football as they drove right past
So what do you say in a moment like this?
When you can't find the words ohh, to tell it like it is
Just bite your tongue and let your heart lead the way
Let's get out of here
Oh, what do you say?
Seventeen years old
She was out with her friends
They started drinkin' at some party
Till she was three sheets to the wind
Her momma always told her
She could call no matter what
She was cryin' on the front steps
When her mom showed up
Well, what do you say in a moment like this?
When you can't find the words ohh, to tell it like it is
Just bite your tongue and let your heart lead the way
Let's get out of here
Oh, what do you say?
Sometimes you gotta listen to the silence
And give yourself a little time to think
Her every breath is weaker than the last
And lately when she sleeps, she talks about the past
Her husband knows she's tired of holdin' on
She looks at him and says, "I wanna go home"
But what do you say in a moment like this?
When you can't find the words to tell it like it is
Just close your eyes and let your heart lead the way
Oh, what do you say?
Ohh, just close your eyes and let your heart lead the way
Oh, what do you say?
Ooo, what do you say?
