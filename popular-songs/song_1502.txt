Saw him sittin on a sidewalk in fresno
Braided hair and a tye-dyed t-shirt on
Talkin to himself about vietnam
About the tour he did and the deal he got
He said this world ain't the same if you ask me.
If I could be somewhere else, I'd tell you where I'd be
I'd be rollin' on a river with credence
Stealin' kisses from peggy sue
I'd be knee-deep in sand on a panama beach
In the spring of '72
I'd be wastin' away on the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide roll in
He said what I wouldn't give just to live those songs again.
Saw him workin' the counter at walgreens
With a new haircut and a bachelor's degree
Talkin' to himself about his raw deal
Cussin' uncle sam and the gi bill
He said this world ain't the same if you ask me
If I could be somewhere else, I'd tell you where I'd be
I'd be rollin' on a river with credence
Stealin' kisses from peggy sue
I'd be knee-deep in sand on a panama beach
In the spring of '72
I'd be wastin' away on the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide roll in
He said what I wouldn't give just to live those songs again.
