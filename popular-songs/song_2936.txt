L.A.'s a fast horse, Daddy
Everybody rides
I'm sorry I haven't called home lately
Out here time flies
I met a boy a few weeks back
He plays in a band
He's a whole lot like you, Daddy
You're gonna like him, he's a good man
At times lonely sneaks up on me
But I'm getting by
Yeah, I know what you've always told me
Cowgirls don't cry
But does that wind still blow in Oklahoma?
Out here the Hollywood stars sure shine bright
It's such a long way from home here in California
Missing you in that blue wide open sky
Out here it's all freeways, fast cars
And cold concrete
You won't believe all the crazy people
Valley girls and sunset things
I met a girl, you're gonna like her, Mama
She has your hair
Red as a tele-cross sunset
Seems like an angel, I swear
I can't say I don't get lonesome
But I'm alright
Cowboys kinda go with homesick
Like blue moons and whippoorwill nights
Does that wind still blow in Oklahoma?
Out here the Hollywood stars sure shine bright
Such a long way from home here in California
Missing you in that blue wide open sky
Does that wind still blow in Oklahoma?
Out here the Hollywood stars sure shine bright
Such a long way from home here in California
Missing you in that blue wide open sky
Don't forget me in your prayers tonight
