Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo, yeah
I know you think I'm like the other man
You let him in and he breaks your heart again
But this things more than physical
I'll free your mind and I'll bless your soul
Tonight we're gonna loose track of time
Body and spirit will intertwine and we'll stay here
The rest of the night and
Baby when the sun comes up, I'm gonna be holding you
It's destiny that your next to me, I'm in love with you
Oh and baby when I wake up, I'm gonna be there with you
A new day rise I wanna look in your eyes when the sun comes up
Wait a minute baby I'm not through
I intend to spend more than one night with you
A love affair that never ends like the old song
Saids, "Lets do it again"
Come with me I know you'll stay
You'll wake up in the morning to a brand new day
Than begins the rest of your life and baby
Baby when the sun comes up, I'm gonna be holding you
It's destiny that your next to me, I'm in love with you
Oh and baby when I wake up, I'm gonna be there with you
A new day rise I wanna look in your eyes when the sun comes up
When the morning breaks I'll awake
And then I won't want you to go
And when your gone I'll hold on to the memory all day
And baby when the sun comes up, yeah, yeah, yeah
So listen here now I know you've been hurt
By the one before I know your pain
And I know you never thought you could love again
But I know the way, yeah, yeah
And I know about your circumstance
But love is here at a 2nd chance
So take my hand and follow me
You'll never wanna leave
You'll still be here, oh yeah, when the sun comes up
You'll still be here in the morning when the sun comes up
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah, when the sun comes up
Yeah, eh, eh, eh, oh yeah, when the sun comes up
In the morning when I rise
I wanna look into your eyes, yeah, when the sun
Oh, oh, oh, oh, when the sun comes up
Yeah, when the sun comes up
Yeah, yeah, when the sun comes up
Yeah, yeah, eh, oh, oh when the sun comes up
Ooh when the sun comes up
Baby when the sun comes up
