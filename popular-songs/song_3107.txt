Well, you know everything's gonna be a breeze
at the end we'll no doubt just slips by the means
we can fix any problem with the slightest ease
(yes please)
But you might find out It'll go to your head
when you write a report on a book you never read
with a snap of your fingers you can made your bed
(That's what I say)
Everything is not what it seems
when you can get all you wanted
in your wildest dreams
you might into the trouble
if you go to extremes,because
everything is not what it seems
Everything is not what it seems
when you can get what you wanted
by the simplest of means
be careful not to mess
with a balance of things
because everything is not...
...what it seems
