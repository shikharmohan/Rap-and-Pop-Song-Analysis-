[Intro]
Dont know how many damn times I've tryed
Ay got to many good things to say
So heres a message to mista Dj!!!
[Chorus]
Play my music like I died (To the Dj)
Like the nina aint alive (Quit the replay)
Like I took the long ride (On my D-day)
Like everybody love my music and the whole world cried
[Verse 1]
Ay
Treat it
like I was comin from billings on the way to spokan
And ya found me twisted and mangled inside our road van
Like its so ugly the paramedics say OH MAN
There go techa nina wit no life but more fans
Like in hell or Im in heaven
just fell in from nine eleven
propellin from high and dove in the concrete
Like my name was mcvey and I check the mail and a bomb beeped
Like having roset was dope and sell it beyond cheap
Like i was in the mood for set trippin'
Fights
Begin and ruggars get splittin'
Like my life is thru and death slips in
Like
Theres no air left and my chest stiffinnnnns....
Like Im in the church and im preachin'
Lovin the way sista look and afta service we creepin'
Play my music like we was in the telly deep asleep then got murdered
Cuz her husband was the deaken.
[Chorus]
Play my music like I died (To the Dj)
Like the nina aint alive (Quit the replay)
Like I took the long ride (On my D-day)
Like everybody love my music and the whole world cried
Play my music like I died (To the Dj)
Like the nina aint alive (Quit the replay)
Like I took the long ride (On my D-day)
Like everybody love my music and the whole world cried
(DJ'S!!!!)
[Verse 2]
(Bring that beat back...Bring that beat back)
Like having super pnumonia with out taking my z-pack
like me off in a seat function flamed up witha a B hat
And im patten my pockets yellin " wheres my piece at "
Like an ink session gettin a snake in the back tat
Got a gun n kicked in the face and i ran to the back "skat!"
Thru the alley under a ladder tripped over a black cat
Fell in the street got hit by a toyota with a hatchback
Play my music let everyone know that I can rhyme
But I got shipped to iraq and I stepped on a land mine
Like a wild bull let out the cage and its ram time
My job is to be the circus clown but im damn blind
Like I had the cuban I accidentily called pin head
Like Im matisyahu in
A room full of skin heads
Play my music like Im permently in bed
Im sure the dj's are with it when him dead
[Chorus]
Play my music like I died (To the Dj)
Like the nina aint alive (Quit the replay)
Like I took the long ride (On my D-day)
Like everybody love my music and the whole world cried
Play my music like I died (To the Dj)
Like the nina aint alive (Quit the replay)
Like I took the long ride (On my D-day)
Like everybody love my music and the whole world cried
(DJ'S!!!!)
[Verse 3]
[backwards rap]
Unless I left my vest and I catch the magnum
like they let tech rest and toe tagged em'
After the beat him tied him to the truck and clod dragged em'
Like i died of lupus, cancer, lucimia, epilepsy, m.s, or sickle cell anemia
All at the same time and the call is a slaign n9ne
Caught by a serial killer with a saw and its pain time
Guess it really does pay to get caught with stray
Thats what it cost, what you pay in a way thats all for the say
Cuase when you rappin' your ass off
Skill is they last thought
Realler than real spill but you get killed and you blast off
Play my records like Im takin the big ride
Like a deadly virus killin me inside
I know you sucka dj's got a lotta pride
All jokes aside even though I'm still alive......
[Chorus]
Play my music like I died (To the Dj)
Like the nina aint alive (Quit the replay)
Like I took the long ride (On my D-day)
Like everybody love my music and the whole world cried
Play my music like I died (To the Dj)
Like the nina aint alive (Quit the replay)
Like I took the long ride (On my D-day)
Like everybody love my music and the whole world cried
(DJ'S!!!!)
[Outro, upset Tech]
Play my music like I died
Like the nina aint alive
Like I took the long ride
Like everbody loved my music and the whole world cryed
