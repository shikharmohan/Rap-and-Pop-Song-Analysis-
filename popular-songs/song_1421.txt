Shift work, hard work, tired body
Blue-collar shirt and a baseball cap
Union Made
He's hot, sweat drops, 'round the clock
Door never locks
And the noise never stops
Not all day
Work seven to three
Three to eleven
Eleven to seven
Shift work, tough work for the busy convenience store clerk
Two feet that hurt, going insane
She's mad at some lad
Drove off and didn't pay for his gas and he won't be the last
'round the clock pain
Work seven to three
Three to eleven
Eleven to seven
Talking about a bunch of shift work
A big ol' pile of shift work
Seven to three
Three to eleven
Eleven to seven
Well i work, shift work,
Ten years man, i hated that work
Then I made a break with the money i saved
It took me to the beach to have a beer by the edge of the sea
And this 'round a clock place
I drank my money away
We partied
Seven to three
Three to eleven
Eleven to seven
Talking about a bunch of shift work
A big ol' pile of shift work
Seven to three
Three to eleven
Eleven to seven
[instrumental interlude]
Talking about a bunch of shift work
A big ol' pile of shift work
Seven to three
Three to eleven
Eleven to seven
Seven to three
Three to eleven
Eleven to seven
