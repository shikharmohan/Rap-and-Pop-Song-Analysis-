He was rough, he was tough
And he drank his whiskey straight
He would fight every night
If he didn't get his way
She was kind, she could find all the good in everyone
And then one day she passed his way, he felt reborn in that morning sun
He saw her face, she called his name
And from that moment he knew he'd never be the same
What you can find in the eyes of a woman
Is a reason to believe
Look deep inside the eyes of a woman
See the man you wanna be
I'd been down, kicked around, the world had got the best of me
Out of rope, little hope I'd ever get back on my feet
She took my hand, said yes, you can
One look at her and I'm a brand-new man
What you can find in the eyes of a woman
Is a reason to believe
Look deep inside the eyes of a woman
See the man you wanna be
When I feel the need for inspiration
With just one look I've found my salvation
What you can find in the eyes of a woman
Is a reason to believe
Look deep inside the eyes of a woman
See the man you wanna be
See the man you wanna be
See the man, see the man you wanna be
