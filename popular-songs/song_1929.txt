Ooh
Hey, yeah, babe, baby
Ooh
She's a goddess, ghetto queen
Sittin' at the park eating sunflower seeds
And I don't know if I'm being cocky
But I swear I think that she was staring at me
I stepped to her like hey sugar mama
You outta line, bein' how ya looking so fine
Just wanna know how could a dude buy
Some of your time, she said, "Sorry, you're not my type"
She blew my mind
(She blew my mind when)
When she replied, I've got a girlfriend
Girl, that's alright I'm not hatin'
Just tryna cool with you, cool with you
So that's your lifestyle ain't nothin' wrong
To be honest, girl, it kinda turns me on
I ain't even tryna gash up a happy crib
But you can call me when you need that alternative
Or someone to hold the camera with a, a steady hand
Don't you even trip, girl, I'm your man
Or if you decide to give the male race, a second chance
She said, "Sorry, but I'm taken"
She blew my mind
(She blew my mind when)
When she replied, I've got a girlfriend
Girl, that's alright I'm not hatin'
Just tryna cool with you, cool with you
She blew my mind
(She blew my mind when)
When she replied, I've got a girlfriend
Girl, that's alright I'm not hatin'
Just tryna cool with you, cool with you
Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
What's crackin' with menage-a-trois?
Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
Is it even cool if I can just watch?
Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
Baby, I just wanna cool wit you
