Whoa Whoa
No, No
Now I can see it girl
You ain't gotta say nothin'
Your lips are calling me
Like they wanna do somethin'
I feel the chemistry, yeah your feelin' me
A little kiss is a definite possibility
Seen you a couple times, had a couple conversations
Since you been on my mind, got a couple observations
Like you by chance, you could be my chick
Play by the rules and you could get what I get
Just keep it quiet, keep in on the hush
And what we do, keep it just between us
I dont wanna see you Tweet 'bout JB cause
The only people that should know is you and me so
Baby, i know that your cool with rockin' with me
But i can't have you tellin' everybody
That you got me all twisted with your lips like this so
Tell me, Tell me are you gonna kiss (kiss n tell)
Tell me are you gonna kiss (kiss n tell)
Tell me are you gonna kiss me
Then tell everybody 
That you got me twisting with your lips

It's confidential
No one has to do with it
You and me girl
Tell em we're doin' it

In all our privacy
Use them lips for kissin' girl if you wanna ride with me
And if you wanna tell somebody
Then we can call the whole thing off

You can go your way and i'll go mine
But i rather spend a little time with you (Yeah)

Keep it on the hush
And what we do keep it just between us
