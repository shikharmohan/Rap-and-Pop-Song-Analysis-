Just woke up and thought I'd try, try to step across the line
You know that I've been thinking 'bout it for a while, yeah
Starting to think it's time I leave does me good to know I finally feel
Feel this pain, it's real, it's possible
You say
Can't change the winds to say, won't matter anyway
Can't reach that far 'cause it's impossible
Can't rise above this place, won't change your mind so I pray
Breaking down the walls to the impossible
Walking by myself I know this lonely road's becoming my new home
But I don't stop I just keep moving on, and on
Ain't no need to dry my eyes, I haven't cried in quite some time
Everyday I fight it, you know it's possible
You say
Can't change the winds to say, won't matter anyway
Can't reach that far 'cause it's impossible
Can't rise above this place, won't change your mind so I pray
Breaking down the walls to the impossible
Someone tell me why it's so hard taking chances?
You draw the line and think that I won't ask for more, yeah
I will stumble and I'll make my own mistakes, yeah
But I won't worry about it anymore, it's impossible
Can't change the winds to say, won't matter anyway
Can't reach that far 'cause it's impossible
Can't rise above this place, won't change your mind so I pray
Breaking down the walls to the impossible
It's impossible to you, not impossible to me
Not impossible for me
Can't rise above this place, won't change your mind so I pray
Breaking down the walls to the impossible
Just woke up and thought I'd try, try to step across the line
