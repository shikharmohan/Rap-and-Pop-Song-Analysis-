You think you know me so well 
You put me down, it builds you up 
You're kicking me around 
You just can't get enough 
And all your friends surround you 
Oh, without them by your side 
You start to show your weakness 
It's something you can't hide 
Yeah yeah 
We'll stop and erase 
Cause I'm gonna wipe 
That smile off your know-it-all face 
Whaoh 
Laugh while you can 
Yeah live it up, but 
Read my lips, the joke is on you 
I've figured it out 
You're all about 
Walking tall on the people you knock down
So stop and erase 
Cause I'm gonna wipe 
That smile off your know-it-all face 
Whaoh 
I'm waking up I'm feeling 
What I was scared to feel before 
I got my eyes wide open 
Won't take it anymore 
All the lies and teasing 
Yes, I could never be that cool
You had them all believing 
But now that's through 
Yeah Yeah 
We'll stop and erase 
Cause I'm gonna wipe 
That smile off your know-it-all face 
Whaoh 
Laugh while you can
Yeah live it up, but 
Read my lips, the joke is on you 
I've figured it out 
You're all about 
Walking tall on the people you knock down
So stop and erase 
Cause I'm gonna wipe 
That smile off your know-it-all face 
Count down, 
The tables have turned 
Better wise up 
You've got lots of nerve 
Cause you're all alone 
Now 
We'll stop and erase 
Cause I'm gonna wipe 
That smile off your know-it-all face 
Whaoh 
Laugh while you can 
Yeah live it up, but
Read my lips, the joke is on you 
Whaoh 
I've figured it out 
You're all about 
Walking tall on the people you knock down. 
So stop and erase 
Cause I'm gonna wipe 
That smile off your know-it-all face 
We'll stop and erase 
Cause I'm gonna wipe 
That smile off your know-it-all face 
Whaoh 
Laugh while you can 
Yeah live it up, but
Read my lips, the joke is on you 
I've figured it out 
You're all about 
Walking tall on the people you knock down 
So stop and erase 
Cause I'm gonna wipe 
That smile off your know-it-all face
