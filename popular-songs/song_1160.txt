I heard the rumor that we're callin' it off and we won't last too long
But I got this feelin' when I'm looking at you baby
They couldn't be more wrong
They've been sayin' it's a shaky romance
And they don't give the two of us too much of a chance
But if the Grand Canyon is just some ditch
Dorothy and Toto fought just some witch
And if babe Ruth was just a guy with a glove
Then oh baby this is just some love
Oh baby this is just some love
I speak my mind baby that's the truth but you've got a temper too
So when they see us start to fuss and fight
Well I guess they think we're through
But if they're judgin' us by what they see
Then they don't have a clue about you and me
'Cause if the Rocky mountains are just some hills
Niagara falls is just some water spill
And if Humphrey Bogart was just some tough
Then oh baby this is just some love
Oh baby this is just some love
If the Grand Canyon is just some ditch
Dorothy and Toto fought just some witch
And if babe Ruth was just a guy with a glove
Then oh baby this is just some love
Oh baby this is just some love
Oh baby this is just some love
Oh baby this is just some love
