Verse 1 
I'm in this restaurant bathroom trying to call you 
Trying to figure out what kind of lie to tell 
At the table sits a sexy little something I just met, and I don't know her that well 
I know it is wrong but I don't give a damn 
That I got you sitting at home thinking that your man 
Is out working, and doing right by you 
Not thinking that someday it would all catch up to me 
People used to say you got a good girl at home, you should really stop running (but I wasn't trying to hear them out) 
What about when she finds out and leaves you all alone? Tell me, what you gonna do then (I'll just turn and say don't worry me now) 
Chorus: 
Let me cross that bridge when I come to it (said don't worry me now) 
Let me cross that bridge when I come to it (said when I come to it) 
Used to think it could never happen to me (never happen to me) 
Threw up my hands and say (don't worry me now) 
Let me cross that bridge when I come to it 
Verse 2: 
Sitting on the couch crying because I been lying 
About the folks I kick it with and where I've been, 
I just walked in at six o'clock in the morning 
Felt like a G-strip Club
And I know I ain't right to be deceiving you 
And take advantage of the fact that you believe me 
Because you love me, so I tell a few lies, 
And I'll turn around and do it all again next time 
People used to say you got a good girl at home, you should really stop running (but I wasn't trying to hear it) 
What about when she finds out and leaves you all alone? Tell me, what you gonna do then (I'll just turn and say don't worry me now) 
Chorus: 
Let me cross that bridge when I come to it (said don't you worry me now) 
Let me cross that bridge when I come to it (when I come to it) 
Used to think it could never happen to me (never happen to me) 
Threw up my hands and say (don't worry me now) 
Let me cross that bridge when I come to it 
Bridge: 
I used to sit back thinking I'd never get caught,
Every lie I sold her believing she bought,
And I slipped up in my game and baby got smart, 
This player got caught up (caught up) up and sure enough she's gone 
As I sit here by myself thinking to myself (damn I really miss her) 
Baby I should've listened instead of frontin' and trippin' 
Talking about don't worry me now 
Chorus: 
Let me cross that bridge when I come to it (when I come to it, come to it, yeah) 
Let me cross that bridge when I come to it (when I come) 
Used to think it could never happen to me (never happen to me) 
Threw up my hands and say (don't worry me now) 
Let me cross that bridge when I come to it 
Chorus: 
Let me cross that bridge when I come to it (It can happen to you) 
Let me cross that bridge when I come to itÃ¢Â¦
