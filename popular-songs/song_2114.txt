Why does she stay?
Why does she stay?
Why does she stay?
She hates that I don't do dishes
Even though I mess up the most
And she begs me all the time to help her
I know that I should but I'm lazy so I don't
She's always considering my feelings
Thinking of me before herself
Most of the time I'm so damn selfish
I don't even realize she treats me so well
She's so much better than me
I'm so unworthy of her
Why does she stay?
Why does she stay?
Why?
She hates that we don't spend much time
We barely see each other at all
She don't even nag me 'bout always working
She just says I just wish every now and then that you'd call
And I don't know why she's still here
She could have any man that she wants
I step outside of myself to see how much she loves me
And all the things that I should do for her that I just don't, just don't
And I realize
She's so much better than me
I'm so unworthy of her
Why does she stay?
Why does she stay?
Tell me why, why, why
Why, why, why, why, why?
She's in love, she's in love, she's in love
And I don't understand, and I don't understand, no
She's in love, she's in love, she's in love
Gotta be a better man for her
So I take my time
And do what I'm suppose to do
Because I just can't see
My life without you, you, you, you, you
Why does she stay?
She's so much better than me
I'm so unworthy of her
Why does she stay?
Why does she stay?
Tell me why, why, why
Why, why, why, why, why?
Why does she stay?
Why does she stay?
Why does she stay?
