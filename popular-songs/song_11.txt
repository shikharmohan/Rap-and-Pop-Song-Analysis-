Daydreamer
Sitting on the seat, soaking up the sun
He is a real lover
Of making up the past and feeling up his girl
Like he's never felt her figure before
A jaw dropper
Looks good when he walks, he is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
But good to catch, and he could change the world
With his hands behind his back, oh
You can find him sitting on your doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And you can tell that he'll be there for life
Daydreamer
With eyes that make you melt, he lends his coat for shelter
Plus he's there for you when he shouldn't be
But he stays all the same, waits for you
Then sees you through
There's no way I could describe him
What I said is just what I'm hoping for
But I will find him sitting on my doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And I can tell that he'll be there for life
And I can tell that he'll be there for life
