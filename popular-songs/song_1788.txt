Oh yeah
Monday Tuesday we were cool
Wednesday I found out 'bout you
Caught my heart by telling lies
You weren't what you advertise
But silly me to believe
I was unique
When I'm gone you put on a show
Oh whoa whoa you gotta go
'Cause what's true about you
Who are you when I'm gone
Wanted to be with you
Don't know what I was on
'Cause you got me to forget me
Oh whoa whoa you know that's true
Yea you got me to forget me
So Friday I'll be over you
Oh yeah
No no I ain't gonna cry
Go and be with her tonight
I really don't care what you do
Cause Friday ill be over you
And silly me to believe
I was unique
When I'm gone you put on a show
Oh whoa whoa you gotta go
'Cause what's true about you
Who are you when I'm gone
Wanted to be with you
Don't know what I was on
'Cause you got me to forget me
Oh whoa whoa you know that's true
Yeah you got me to forget me
So Friday I'll be over you
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
And silly me to believe
When I'm gone you put on a show
Oh whoa whoa you know that's true
