Here's the thing
We started out friends
It was cool but it was all pretend
Yeah, yeah, since you've been gone
You're dedicated
You took the time
Wasn't long till I called you mine
Yeah, yeah, since you've been gone
And all you'd ever hear me say
Is how I picture me with you
That's all you ever hear me say
But since you've been gone
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah yeah, thanks to you
Now I get what I want, since you've been gone
How can I put it? You put me on
I even fell for that stupid love song
Yeah yeah, since you've been gone
How come I never hear you say
I just wanna be with you
I guess you never felt that way
But since you've been gone
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, oh, yeah, yeah, thanks to you
Now I get, I get what I want
(Since you've been gone)
You had your chance, you blew it
Out of sight, out of mind
Shut your mouth, I just can't take it
Again and again and again and again
Since you've been gone
(Since you've been gone)
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah, yeah, thanks to you
(Thanks to you)
Now I get, I get what I want
Since you've been gone
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah, yeah, thanks to you, thanks to you
Now I get
(I get)
You should know, you should know
That I get, I get what I want
Since you've been gone
Since you've been gone
Since you've been gone
