Slide on over baby
Underneath this mistletoe
Here's a toast to us together
Let me wrap you in this bow
I'm in the Christmas spirits
No, this one won't be blue
It's gonna be the best one ever
And it's all because of you, baby
You're the angel at the top of my tree
Best present anybody ever gave me
I got it decorated, all lite up, gift's underneath
You're the angel at the top of my tree
Let's put on that old movie
''It's a Wonderful Life''
'Cause curled up by the fire
It sure is true tonight
Let's make a little candle
And the a little later on
We'll make a little love
To that old Bing Crosby song, baby
You're the angel at the top of my tree
Best present anybody ever gave me
I got it decorated, all lite up, gifts underneath
You're the angel at the top of my tree
You're the angel at the top of my tree
Best present anybody ever gave me
I got it decorated, all lite up, gifts underneath
You're the angel at the top of my tree
Baby, you're the angel
