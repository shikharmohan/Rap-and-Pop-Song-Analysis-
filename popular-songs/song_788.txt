So we did it again, knowing we should quit it
But we simply won't admit it again
Oh it feels good, it's so good
But I won't do it again
It's so dramatic again, after we go at it
We get mad then we go at it again
Oh I love it, then I hate it
She's my favorite again
I'm wasting time, I can't help it she's so fine
Oh, I like her style and I love the way she talks and I smile
As much as we may try, can't quite see eye to eye
So in the meantime, I guess we say bye bye
  (And again, and again, and again)
Oh, and then we do it again
  (And again and again and again)
We do it again and we do it again
  (And again, and again, and again)
Oh, and then, we do it again
  (And again, and again, and again)
We want it again and we want it again
So we fake it again, I think we're gonna blow it
And we know it but she's naked again
We get wasted, then I taste it
Then I waste it again
I can't invite her again
'Cause she'll go from a lover to a fighter
And I'll fight her again
So it's over, but I told her to come over again
I'm wasting time but she's always on my mind
I can't let her go, oh, she's not the best but she's all that I know
As much as we may try can't quite see eye to eye
So in the meantime I guess we say bye bye
  (And again, and again, and again)
Oh, and then we do it again
  (And again and again and again)
We do it again and we do it again
  (And again, and again, and again)
Oh, and then, we do it again
  (And again, and again, and again)
We want it again, and we want it again
We want it again. and we want it again
(Do it again, do it again)
We want it again, we want it again
So I've got a new friend, I wish I could forget you
But I miss you, wanna kiss you again
Well she's like you, but she's not you
Gotta find you again
So we remember again, the middle of December
And I took you out to dinner again
Oh I love her, it's not over
It's another again
  (And again, and again, and again)
Oh, it's another again
  (And again, and again, and again)
I love her, it's another again
  (And again, and again, and again)
Oh, it's another again
  (And again, and again, and again)
Oh, it's another again
  (And again, and again, and again)
Do it again
  (And again, and again, and again)
Do it again
It's another, it's another again
