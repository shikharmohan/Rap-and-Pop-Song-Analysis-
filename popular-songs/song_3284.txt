Yeah, it's like the ultimate party favor baby you know
Two cups will get her hot and out of her clothes you know
Caribou Lou
It's like 151 rum, pineapple juice and Malibu
Caribou, get them all numb, make baby girl come
Out of her shell and raise hell
Don't stop 'til the cops come
Half a bottle of 151, off in a jug one cup of Malibu rum
Baby, that's whassup? Then you fill the rest of the jug
With pineapple juice and its cracking
The only defect is waking up like, "What happened?"
I like red light parties and fed right bodies
Who like, red like Dolly and head right totties at night
Aribou kay, ou-la, terrible day
You paid the liquor store teller with no hair-a to braid
Touch, get the party jumping, keep the hotties humping
I like them thick and juicy, so don't Pilate nothing
Drinking to much Lou, you, you might be karate punching
Or at the back of the club, attending the naughty luncheon
Satin, Kool-Aid gives you hella 151, November dog
So run kitty run, we gon' drink it until we done
Diddy, dum, bum biddy bum
Here Kansas City, come so give me some
151 rum, pineapple juice and Malibu
Caribou get them all numb, make baby girl come
Outta her shell and raise hell
We gon' party 'til the cops come
151 rum, pineapple juice and Malibu
Caribou get them all numb, make baby girl come
Outta her shell and raise hell
We gon' party 'til the cops come
I see double, I see triple, might be trouble, might see pistols
We ain't trying to hear you hata's sucking on sickles
We living it up in two double oh sizzle
One to your maybro, unto your day go
Why I'm the one to drink you under the table?
And all the ladies that were doing time
Want you to become a member of my drinking club
You will find

Trying to tell her truly get nudie, yes, I even do L words
In the fruity bazoodi, like to drink it and yell slurs at the movie
If I'm heated, I'm off to get a Caribou Lou to cool me

Insane mainy, keep 'em coming then I'll remain zany
'Cause I'da say baby, I'm trying to make you my main damey
For the rest of the night, girl, you sexy and tight
