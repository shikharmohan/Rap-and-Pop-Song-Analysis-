(Intro - T.I.) Ay, ay, ay! Now listen to me for a minute. Ay, ay, ay! Can ya hear me? (Ciara) Yeah, yeah, ye-ah! La-la-la-la-la-la-la! Ha ha ha, yeah, ye-ah! La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ye-ah!
(Verse 1 - T.I.) I know what you be thinkin' when ya hear me tryna holla, I'm a baller! You don't wanna come near me. I know ya hear me, but you really ain't tryna be bothered. Cause you probably used to leavin' out the club gettin' followed. But listen, shawty, I ain't nothin' like a stalker. If I say then I mean it, I ain't just a sweet talker. I know I want a woman 'fore i ever try to call her. I know ya first mind tell ya to decline, but you oughta. Come and chill for a minute, take a load off. Know ya heard rumors, playin' hoes, them throw it off! If ya choose to listen to them then it yo loss. But what you wanna do let me know, 'fore I roll off. I know ya havin' second thoughts, it ain't yo fault. Just don't let the bling scare ya off, I'm a sure floss. But I keep my business to myself, let the hoes talk. Kick it wit da King, be the Queen, yup, at no cost.
(Chorus - Ciara) I'll be your Queen, for a day. baby we can get away (maybe we can get away). I can do anythin u wanna do (yeah), any time just pick its place. I'll be your Queen, for a day. Maybe you won't have to chase (baby). If ya really want me to be the one, all ya gotta do is say, "Be My Queen!"
(Verese 2 - T.I.) Come and hang wit me, shawty, I can change ya life! Not a lil bit, look I'm talkin' major! Like first class flights, not firt class seats. Got a "Go-G Phone" if ya commin' wit me. I put you in position bra, we beyond the ol' beach. Hoppin' in the cool cars, right in front of the suite. Tell the driver to drop us off in front of the beach. Set up a table in the sand, fix us somethin' to eat. You'll be surprised whatcha learn sit and talkin' to me. How the moon and the stars glisten off of the sea. You've hardly ever seen only one woman it me, and if ya did then she probably mean something to me. I know you know I toll blocks, and I come from the street. Now, I done grown up a lot, sinceI was runnin' the streets. And even if that don't change ya opinion in me, aren't ya glad you got the chance to come and kick it with me, right?
(Chorus - Ciara) I'll be your Queen, for a day. baby we can get away (maybe we can get away). I can do anythin u wanna do (yeah), any time just pick its place. I'll be your Queen, for a day. Maybe you won't have to chase (baby). If ya really want me to be the one, all ya gotta do is say, "Be My Queen!"
(Verse 3 - T.I.) I know ya had a chance to listen to the rest flirt, for you give on up its all come and try the best first. I can give it to ya slow, i can make the sex hurt. Ooh, but no pressure, we ain't gotta have sex first. I know you wanna note on this, some nutural respect first. But before we go kick it if ya wanna clear ya head first. We can blow on the first bloat, 'till it make ya chest hurt. Take a couple shots, shot the top of the wet vert. Call up ya homegirl, we can go and get her! if she love a good time then tonight might impress her (ha ha). Squeeze in ya tight skirt, match wit ya best purse. I can show ya both how to ball im an expert.
(Chorus - Ciara) I'll be your Queen, for a day. baby we can get away (maybe we can get away). I can do anythin u wanna do (yeah), any time just pick its place. I'll be your Queen, for a day. Maybe you won't have to chase (baby). If ya really want me to be the one, all ya gotta do is say, "Be My Queen!"
