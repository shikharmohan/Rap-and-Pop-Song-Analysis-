So here you are again
Standing at my door
You know I'll understand
Well, that's what friends are for
What's he done this time?
What did he say
To make you so darn mad?
That you're running away
Now you say you want to be
Like me independent and free
But if you only knew
What a single girl goes through
The long working days and the lonely nights
The empty I love you's
Oh, if you only knew what it's like to be alone
You'd put your anger down
Turn around and go back home
My life looks good to you
I'm always in control
No one to answer to
But no one there to hold
You see in my eyes you are the lucky one
With loving arms that you can lean upon
I'd give anything I could to save
What you're throwing away
'Cause if you only knew
What a single girl goes through
The long working days and the lonely nights
The empty I love you's
Oh, if you only knew what it's like to be alone
You'd put your anger down
Turn around and go back home
I know it's hard to face
That love ain't perfect everyday
But I know a hundred girls
Who would gladly take your place
So if you only knew
What a single girl goes through
The long working days and the lonely nights
The empty I love you's
Oh, if you only knew what it's like to be alone
You'd put your anger down
Turn around and go back home
You'd put your anger down
Turn around and go back home
If you only knew
