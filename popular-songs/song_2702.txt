The house stood empty on a corner
Waiting for a brand new owner
A soldier off to war who had to
Leave his bride alone
She couldn't buy too many nice things
But she tried until they told her
On a G. I. bill and daydreams
He was never coming home
Small two bedroom starter
Needs a little fixing
A great big yard for kids and pets to play
This one won't last too long
It's close to schools and churches
Owner leaving town
You better hurry down today
Bought by the high school teacher
Sold it to a Baptist Preacher
Who couldn't pay his taxes
'Cause his flock had gone astray
So the banker fenced the yard in
Planted trees and half a garden
The man from Dallas kept it up
'Til he moved away
Small two bedroom starter
Needs a little fixing
A great big yard for kids and pets to play
This one won't last too long
It's close to schools and Churches
Owner leaving town
You better hurry down today
You and I we built the playroom
For the baby that came too soon
Spent money that we didn't have
Trying to make this place our own
Lord it makes me feel like dying
After all these years of trying
Honey, we'll just knock this house
That we can't seem to make a home
Small two bedroom starter
Needs a little fixing
A great big yard for kids and pets to play
This one won't last too long
It's close to schools and Churches
Owner leaving town
You better hurry down today
Small two bedroom starter
Waiting for a brand new owner
