Ladies side to side like this ladies
I'm gon' let Ne-Yo sing to ya'll real quick
Gon' let my nephew sing to ya'll
Real smooth
Ya'll might realate to this one right here
[Ne-Yo:Verse 1]
I saw you from across the way,
Lookin like a fantasy,
You know that I once said,
This is for the climax,
You can come and stay,
I'm just tryin to think of how to say it,
Girl if you shot me down it woud be wasteless,
Know you get mad at me,
But I gotta tell you honestly,
I don't even wanna know you,
[Ne-Yo:Chorus]
I don't even wanna know your name,
I just wanna put this thang on u, (if you want)
We ain't gotta have a convorsation,
Or exchange information,
Cuz I don't even wanna know you,
Just wanna hit it,
And quit it,
And get with it,
Can I put this thang on u,
[Ne-Yo:Verse 2]
Babe ain't no reason to get mad, (girl)
Don't look at me like that,
I don't wanna disrespect you,
I'm just tryin to let you,
(Let me hit it from the back,
I just wanna skip this,
Convorsation we want nothing like we're intrested,
Took a little pen and paper no forget it,
Baby even where I'm going I ain't intrested,
Don't wanna know you,
[Ne-Yo:Chorus]
I don't even wanna know your name,
I just wanna put this thang on u, (if you want)
We ain't gotta have a convorsation,
Or exchange information,
Cuz I don't even wanna know you,
Just wanna hit it,
And quit it,
And get with it,
Can I put this thang on u,
[Snoop Dogg:Verse 3]
I'm slick can I get it,
I'm slick and I'm smooth,
I'll break your back like that,
Yea I stick to the groove,
The mood is smooth the price is right,
I got a sweet rolled up and we can shake like dice, (yea)
Get in the car and get behind me,
And when it's over with baby please don't try to find me,
Quit playin games we can play this thang the same,
There's a couple things I wanna do to you before I become a stranger,
(don't wanna know you)
[Ne-Yo:Chorus x2]
I don't even wanna know your name,
I just wanna put this thang on u, (if you want)
We ain't gotta have a convorsation,
Or exchange information,
Cuz I don't even wanna know you,
Just wanna hit it,
And quit it,
And get with it,
Can I put this thang on u,
I don't even wanna know your name,
I just wanna put this thang on u, (if you want)
We ain't gotta have a convorsation,
Or exchange information,
Cuz I don't even wanna know you,
Just wanna hit it,
And quit it,
And get with it,
Can I put this thang on u,
