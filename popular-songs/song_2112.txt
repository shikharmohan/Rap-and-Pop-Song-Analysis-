6 o clock
seconds feel like hours as i sit here
n watch them tick away
and just the thought
of seein u again i wana dance
ive longed for this day
so
ill be waiting
cus i cant smile until i see your smile
ill be waiting
nothin else that i would rather do
ill be waiting
cus i cant sleep until i feel your touch
ill be waiting
patiently ill wait right here for you
waiting for you
12 am
the crowd is gettin thin but thats ok
cus im not here for them
i refuse
to move from this spot
until i feel your heart
pressed against mine againn
so
ill be waiting
cus i cant smile until i see your smile
ill be waiting
nothin else that i would rather do
ill be waiting
cus i cant sleep until i feel your touch
ill be waiting
patiently ill wait right here for you
waiting for you
i dont care how long it takes
i dont mind ill sit n wait
until the sun goes down
and comes back up again
cus your the best thing in my life
without you it just aint right
so take as long as you like
ill still be waiting
