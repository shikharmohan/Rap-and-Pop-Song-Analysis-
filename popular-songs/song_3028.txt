I can't say, "I didn't know what I was doin'"
I can't pretend, things just got outta hand
I should've kept my distance while I was still strong
But I got caught up in the feelin'
Carried along and it's too late baby
I can't stop now
Well I walked right in with my eyes wide open, I did
And I was blind when you told me
"You'll be mine just as soon as you were free"
I should have kept my distance while I was still strong
But I got caught up in the feelin'
Carried along and it's too late baby
I can't stop now
Can't stop now
Crazy heart's runnin' outta control
Can't stop now
And I'll be fallin' apart somewhere down the road
I might be headed for a breakdown but I can't stop now
Breakdown
