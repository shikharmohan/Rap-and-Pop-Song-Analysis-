I don't need you, boy
I don't need nobody else
I can do damage by myself
Walk in the room, everybody like damn
She can do damage by herself
I don't need nobody else
I can do damage by myself
Walk in the room, everybody like damn
She can do damage by herself
Ms. Everybody wants it
But can't nobody touch it?
Ms. I don't rain, I'm hailing
Go get the umbrellas
Ms. Silence in the room
Click, click, click, my Jimmy Choos
Listen around for tension then
And everybody's chick is wishin'
They had that eye action
Always attackin'
Swaggers go so automatic
Starts to get like an addict, addict
You say it's incredible
Maybe it's unbelievable
Damn near inconceivable
But I say, I say, I say, I say
Turn off the lights
I got my right hand in position
So I can get that when I'm with ya
Come on, on, come on, on
I'm on, on, I'm turned on
Come on, on, come on, on
I'm on, on, I'm turned on
I don't need nobody else
I can do damage by myself
Walk in the room, everybody like damn
She can do damage by herself
Ms. Call the paramedics
'Cause chicks is lookin' sick
Ms. I don't need your paper
My net worth never waivers
Ms. On your mark, set, go, yeah
I'm runnin' this show
Ms. Back at it once again
Lights, camera, action
They had that eye action
Always attackin'
Swaggers go so automatic
Starts to get like an addict, addict
You say it's incredible
Maybe it's unbelievable
Damn near inconceivable
But I say, I say, I say, I say
Turn off the lights
I got my right hand in position
So I can get that when I'm with ya
Come on, on, come on, on
I'm on, on, I'm turned on
Turn off the lights
I got my right hand in position
So I can get that when I'm with ya
Come on, on, come on, on
I'm on, on, I'm turned on
Umm, I'm turned on
I'm on overload from dusk to dawn
Ready to explode
'Cause baby, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on like the light, lights
I'm on like a fight, fight
I'm on 'cause it's right
'Cause it's right, 'cause it's right, I'm on
Turn off the lights
I got my right hand in position
So I can get that when I'm with ya
Come on, on, come on, on
I'm on, on, I'm turned on
I don't need nobody else
I can do damage by myself
Walk in the room, everybody like damn
She can do damage by herself
I don't need nobody else
I can do damage by myself
Walk in the room, everybody like damn
She can do damage by herself
By herself
