This is a hard, cold beat
You can go dance if you like
You won't get in trouble
And the tea has some spice
You wanna know, yeah, it hits ya
You can make, have some fun
Watching them make you away
Up on the wall you won't
What's in the wait, your waiter?
You only ate your garnish
I ordered Spam and rice
Is this to say you're fired?
We dance on the table tops
We only had your daughter
We ordered too many cocktails
Watching the way you love
