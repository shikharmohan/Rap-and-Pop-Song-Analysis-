I want your lovin' more and more
I want your kisses, that's for sure
I die each time I hear the sound
They're sayin' here he comes
He's Cathy's Clown
You know you've got to stand tall
You know a man can't crawl
And when you let her tell you lies
And you let 'em pass you by
You're not a man at all
She don't want your lovin' anymore
She don't want your kisses, that's for sure
Why do you let them put you down
And let 'em call you Cathy's Clown?
When you see me shed a tear
Then you know that I'm sincere
I just think it's kinda sad
That she's treatin' you so bad
And I'm the one who cares
I want your lovin' more and more
I want your kisses that's for sure
And I die each time I hear the sound
They're sayin' here he comes
He's Cathy's Clown
You're Cathy's Clown, you're Cathy's Clown
