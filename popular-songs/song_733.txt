Guess I should have shut my mouth
But I had to get it out
So much for bein' headstrong
Now I'm goin' half way out my mind
I know I was out of line
No scratch that I was dead wrong
Know I shoulda let it go but I just had to be right
Ooh, coulda left it alone but, no, I had to be right
Swear I woulda just fell back if I knew all I'd be left with
Is these shoulda, coulda, wouldas 'cause you're gone
Now I'm out here trippin' 'cause you came up missing
And my head keeps spinning, it's gettin' out of control
I'm backin' down this time, I don't wanna fight
I don't care who's right
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone
Heaven knows if you were here
I'd be all up in your ear
Least you could do is answer your phone
'Cause I realized my mistake
Baby, I'll do what it takes
If I can just get you one and one
Shoulda let it go but I just had to be right
Ooh, coulda left it alone but, no, I had to be right
Swear I woulda just fell back if I knew all I'd be left with
Is these shoulda, coulda, wouldas 'cause you're gone
Now I'm out here trippin' 'cause you came up missing
And my head keeps spinning, it's gettin' out of control
I'm backin' down this time, I don't wanna fight
I don't care who's right
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone
I know I pushed you out, runnin' off at the mouth
Sayin' all the wrong things, callin' you out your name
I was unpredictable, I was so emotional
But I swear I'm gonna do better, can we get this back together again?
Now I'm out here trippin' 'cause you came up missing
And my head keeps spinning, it's gettin' out of control
I'm backin' down this time, I don't wanna fight
I don't care who's right
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone
Now I'm out here trippin' 'cause you came up missing
And my head keeps spinning, it's gettin' out of control
I'm backin' down this time, I don't wanna fight
I don't care who's right
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone
So wrong, hear me, come back, it seems so long
