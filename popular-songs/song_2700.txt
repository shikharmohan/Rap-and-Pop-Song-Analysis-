If you see him, tell him I wish him well
How am I doin'?
Well, sometimes it's hard to tell
I still miss you more than ever
But please don't say a word
If you see him, oh, if you see him
If you see her, tell her I'm doin' fine
And if you want to
Say that I think of her from time to time
Ask her if she ever wonders
Where we both went wrong
If you see her, if you see her
Oh, I still want her, and I still need him so
Oh, I don't know why we let each other go
If you see her, tell her the light's still on for her
Nothing's changed, deep down, the fire still burns for him
And even if it takes forever, say I'll still be here
If you see him, if you see her
If you see him, if you see her
