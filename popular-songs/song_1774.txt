Miley Cyrus "Party in the USA"
Rap/Hip-Hop remix (featuring Young Duece)
*Lyrics*
Verse 1 (Kidd Flow)
We're on the move, bout to head out to the car,
Then we're hoppin on the plane, bout to meet the A&R;,
He say he got plans, and we make a lot of jams,
Everytime we post a video he rates it 5 stars,
We got a little buzz, all we need is a deal,
It could spread across the world and let the secret be revealed,
Cause homie we've been hot, we don't really need to chill,
Plus we've heard it all before, man I'm hoping he forreal,
I'm gettin' kinda old, and younger is better,
That's what I've been told but I'm down with whatever,
I just wanna get heard, man I know that we deserve it,
Been had the picture, now we tryna make it perfect,
But we got a long way to go,
Hold on, I think my song is on the radio!
Chorus (Miley Cyrus)
So I put my hands up, they're playin' my song
The butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like "Yeah!"
Movin' my hips like "Yeah!"
Got my hands up, they're playin' my song
And now I'm gonna be okay
Yeah! It's a party in the USA!
Yeah! It's a party in the USA!
Verse 2 (PJ)
Flow, I know we're gonna make it,
And when we reach the top, I know we're gonna take it,
Everybody loves it, I know they're gonna hate it,
Top number one, I know we're gonna rank it,
Livin' my life up, I can live it down,
Cause now I'm livin' somethin' that yall never seen,
It's hard to get in, and I don't need to dream,
Cause I'm livin' a life that I never thought I'd see,
Lookin' back now, thinkin' of when we first started,
Seeing how that was, now look where we brought it,
I won't avoid it, I only move forward,
Cause moving backwards results in a caution,
"And the Miley Cyrus song was on"
"And the Miley Cyrus song was on"
Chorus
Verse 3
(PJ)
I feel like I have,
A long route to go,
(KF)
And I don't know what's ahead of me,
But I 'm steadily on this road,
The lights are flashing,
And they're telling me to go,
So for now, I'm saying "Goodbye",
And "Hello", so I put my hands up..
Chorus (2x)
