You have turned me into something
That I'm not meant to be
You reprogrammed me
And made me into the man
That you want me to be
Oh my God, I didn't know
Anything that I should know
You were just the one to show me how
Everything I had to do
Star again, all brand new
But I didn't know, oh how
Waiting here for your call
Waiting for instructional
Booklet to tell me how
Nothing that I ever do
Was ever good enough for you
You have changed my program and now
Like a robot taking me over
I don't know nothing
What can I do?
I'm a changed man
You had me programmed
It's part of your plan, what can I do?
Like a robot taking me over
I don't know nothing
You changed me, reprogrammed me
Like a robot taking me over
I don't know nothing
What can I do?
Oh my God, I didn't know
Anything that I should know
You were just the one to show me how
Do this, do that, you would shout
If I didn't do it now
Then you would turn my lights out
(Out, out)
Waiting on your beck and call
Waiting for instructional
Booklet to tell me how
But I seem to have go
I am now your robot
Not allowed, out on my own
Like a robot taking me over
I don't know nothing
What can I do?
I'm a changed man
You had me programmed
It's part of your plan, what can I do?
Like a robot taking me over
I don't know nothing
You changed me, reprogrammed me
Like a robot taking me over
I don't know nothing
What can I do?
Oh my God, I couldn't see
You were really changing me
Making me into somebody new
(New, new)
You were just controlling me
You were just composing me
Now I wanna refuse, oh
Like a robot taking me over
I don't know nothing
What can I do?
I'm a changed man
You had me programmed
It's part of your plan
You changed me, reprogrammed me
You changed me, reprogrammed me
Like a robot
(I'm not your robot)
Taking me over
(I'm not your robot)
I don't know nothing
(I'm not your robot)
(I'm not your robot)
(No more)
(I'm not your robot)
What can I do?
