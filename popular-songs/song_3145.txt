[1st verse]
I've been around the world
And I yi yi
Don't know why people
What? 
Why people go to the strip club
To spend their dough
Just to see butt
To see these ladies strip
And take off all their clothes
I do not know why
They choose such a spot
I just don't know why
We get hot
It's probably cause
They make it hop and twurk the pole
And their headlights are sitting bold
Makes it look like it's getting' cold
Can I hold you tight
Hop on my lap
And do that dance
I come to spend ones and huns
On lovely skin
Booty weighs a ton
Let the game begin
Cause here I come
Teccanina swope down like space invaders boy
Pull out the piece like on you haters boy
Forget about the haters
I don't wanna talk about 'em
On this right now
I wanna talk about
That butt them breasts
Yes yes wanna test
Now sanity stops
When the fannie g. drops
Fantasy locked
On makin' the canopy rock
Panties be hot
When we walk in
All vanity pops
In every glam if she's stocked
Make her make it
Frantically hop
We're all at the tittie bar
Vip and all of the kitties
Are sittin' with me
They're all knowin'
Who we are
Techn9ne, baby
How you doin'
What you drinkin'
Caribou
Is what I'm thinkin'
Kansas city, baby
Hey, yo, yo, yo, yo,
We got relish
Don't be jealous
That's a hey no, no,no
Me and my fellas
Travelin' lookin' for them
Who does what
Make it hop
In houston, texas
Atl, california
Whazzup
[chorus]
Bianks with breasts and big butts
Here I come baby
Enough to make the big bucks
Here I come baby
151 and malibu rum and pineapple juice in
My cup
Here I come baby
Fellas in the front
Let me hear you grunt
Fellas in the back
Watch that booty clap
Ladies in the middle
Let me hear you sizzle
Yell
Techn9ne is hard as hell
[2nd verse]
Catch me on the couch
With two stouts
Mouth to mouth
Bounce to the techno festival
See lots of lezbo
Lets go ghetto
Or heavy metal
We slam dancing
Blair witch raves
In the woods
Up in cameron
Rollin'
Diggin' the private schoolers
St. theresa's bishop hogan
Those are the kind
That do ya
Get that sarabell explosion
All of my homies kick it pockets
Ain't no punk
Trav, dyno, grant, kut
Seven, john, george, monk
All at the tittie bar
Drinkin' and laughin'
My homie b'zle
Started this at bazooka's
Booties clappin'
Black, asian, white, hatian, mexican
And italian
Doin' tricks with beer bottles
Sexy mixed mullato
I'm comin' to get ya
Drinkin' liquor
Off in sweden, germany, london
Back to the stl
Off in memphis
Raisin' hell
With a stack of hundreds
Kick her that
In miami
In the benz
Aristocrat
Where the strippers at
[chorus]
Bianks with breasts and big butts
Here I come baby
Enough to make the big bucks
Here I come baby
151 and malibu rum and pineapple juice
In my cup
Here I come baby
Fellas in the front
Let me hear you grunt
Fellas in the back
Watch the bootie clap
Ladies in the middle
Let me hear you sizzle
Yell
Techn9ne is hard as hell
[3rd verse]
What y'all doin' after this scat
With this back activist mack
Blasphemous acts
Hit em with a stack
That will distract a bitch
All I wanna do
Is hit the back of this black abyss
In the cat in the hat for risk
If you really wanna master this
Know it's a whole lotta cash to get
Me and my homeboys
Will get with
Your homegirls
And get in our own world
We gotta be ready
To get up and go
To the bedroom
Or up in the bathroom
Givin' me and my homeboys a show
Baby get low
To a techn9ne tempo
Do you know
What you're in for
Rough sex
Much sweat
Enough flesh
What's next
Make her say
Oh la la la la
Give it to me techn9ne
You're the best time
That I ever had
Give it to me papa
Hit the na na na
And oh oh oh oh yeah
I love it when you do me
Like this teccanina
And I like it
When you make it do that
In kansas city
We scan the tittes
And brand sadities
Were handsome hippies
Who land some quickies
We comin to kick it
Where you from
Pirates come screamin'
Yo ho ho
151 rum
[chorus]
Bianks with breasts and big butts
Here I come baby
Enough to make the big bucks
Here I come baby
151 and malibu rum and pineapple juice
In my cup
Here I come baby
Fellas in the front
Let me hear you grunt
Fellas in the back
Watch that bootie clap
Ladies in the middle
Let me hear you sizzle
Yell
Techn9ne is hard as hell
