Well, pardon me but you have my attention
Ever since you strolled into the room
Believe me that it's not my intention
If I appear to come on too smooth
It's not like me to make such advances
But this time, baby, I could not resist
So if you're up for taking a chance on love
I can't see a better time than this
So baby, why not tonight?
This could be the start of something right
Hey, you can take it easy, we can take it so slow
We can take it anywhere that you'd like to go
So baby why not tonight?
The stars are out and I'm sure they'll agree
Oh, it's a perfect night for falling in love
So, why not fall in love with me?
Oh, maybe we could go out for some dinner
And later on how we could do the town
Ya know, I consider myself a winner
Just to have a boy like you around
Then if you're up for doing some dancing
Yeah, I know a place they dance until the dawn
Anything you like will be alright
So why not take a chance and come along?
So baby, why not tonight?
This could be the start of something right
Hey, you can take it easy, we can take it so slow
We can take it anywhere that you'd like to go
So, baby why not tonight?
The stars are out and I'm sure they'll agree
Oh, it's a perfect night for falling in love
So, why not fall in love with me?
Why not fall in love?
Why not fall in love?
Baby, why not fall in love with me?
