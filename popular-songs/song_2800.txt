Well, there's news flying 'round
On the nosy side of town
That I have gone and found somebody new
Well, there are to be a law
Against the way some people talk
I guess sometimes it's all they have to do
Oh, there ain't no such thing
As me not loving you
Honey, there ain't no such thing
As me not being true
So, believe your heart and not your ears
Your heart knows what is true
There ain't no such thing
As me not loving you
Well, a love like yours and mine
Has got to deal with the jealous kind
But I don't mind there's nothing I can do
'Cause their words can do no harm
With you, here, in my arms
So, they can talk until their talk turn blue
Oh, there ain't no such thing
As me not loving you
Honey, there ain't no such thing
As me not being true
So, believe your heart and not your ears
When your heart knows what is true
There ain't no such thing
As me not loving you
There ain't no such thing
As me not loving you
Oh, no
