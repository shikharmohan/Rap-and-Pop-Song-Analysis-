Mama stood on the front porch wringing her hands
Watched the tail lights fading on his black Trans Am
With her precious little baby taking off inside
Staring at him with stars in her eyes
She tried to tell her, but the girl might as well have been deaf
She wasn't gonna listen to a word she said
Don't go down Maggie Creek Road
With a boy looking like that
He'll tell you things that you wanna hear
And there'll be no turning back
There's an oak tree down by the lake
In the shade where the wild flowers grow
What'll happen, only heaven knows
So don't go down Maggie Creek Road
It was a still black night, as dark as cold
Nobody heard her when she said "no"
She kicked and screamed and got free somehow
Tore her dress on the door when he pushed her out
She walked 13 miles on the gravel road
With tears in her eyes 20 years ago
Don't go down Maggie Creek Road
With a boy looking like that
He'll tell you things that you wanna hear
And there'll be no turning back
There's an oak tree down by the lake
In the shade where the wild flowers grow
What'll happen, only heaven knows
So don't go down Maggie Creek Road
Somehow mama's always known
'Cause they shoulda been home an hour ago
When she pulled up, it was just going down
She turned her headlights off, didn't make a sound
She heard her baby cry "no," but he wouldn't stop
Her heart went cold, and her blood ran hot
With a pistol in her hand, she opened his door
You don't wanna see mama go to war
Don't go down Maggie Creek Road
With a boy looking like that
He'll tell you things that you wanna hear
And there'll be no turning back
There's an oak tree down by the lake
In the shade where the wild flowers grow
What'll happen, only heaven knows
So don't go down
I said, don't go down Maggie Creek Road
Oh, don't go down Maggie Creek Road
Oh, don't go down Maggie Creek Road
Maggie Creek Road
