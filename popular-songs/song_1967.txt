The way
Hold up, Ne-Yo, ya
The way you switch
Little mama so thick, I'm so sick
Body like a shotgun
She's a hot one, clock go click
And she know it
Measurements 36, 24, 46
And everywhere you have a problem
Probably tired of hearing it
Yeah, Shorty, I don't wanna waste your time
It ain't a secret, baby girl, you fine
You could have anybody here that you want
That's right, including this fella
'Cause you're a diamond and I dig your shine
But I don't gotta tell you that
You know you look good, girl, you know you fine
So I don't gotta tell you that, no
'Cause I know you hear it all the time
Don't wanna gas you up
But it ain't like I can just pass you up
Show me your strut
You make a dude wanna cash you up
But that I ain't how I do
You look good but I ain't gon' buy you
Said, I just wanna try you
Hit up my cell if it's cool to slide through
Hey, shorty I don't wanna waste your time
It ain't a secret, baby girl, you fine
And you can have anybody here that you want
That's right, including this fella
'Cause you're a diamond and I dig your shine
But I don't gotta tell you that
You know you look good, girl, you know you fine
So I don't gotta tell you that, no
'Cause I know you hear it all the time
Shorty I don't got no game
Ain't got no falsie playa wit for me to say
That girl, you are off the chain
But I'm sure, baby, sure you knew that anyway
But I don't gotta tell you that
You know you look good, girl, you know you fine
So I don't gotta tell you that, no
'Cause I know you hear it all the time
I don't got to tell you that
You know you fine, so wassup?
You rolling? Let's go
