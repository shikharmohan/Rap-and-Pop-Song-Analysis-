[Verse 1]
Maybe I was wrong,
Maybe you were right,
Maybe I don't listen like I should,
Maybe when I don't,
Don't come home at night,
It tends to bother you,
Maybe I could start,
Answering a page,
Call if I'd be late that'd be good,
What I'm trying to say,
Is that I'm gonna try and do better for you,
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm aware that they're some faults in this relationship,
Where I could try a bit harder than I do and so I'm telling you,
[Chorus]
I'm not,
I'm not perfect,
Just making sure with me,
Baby please,
I'm gonna be so right for you girl,
So im,
So imperfect,
Just don't give up on me,
You will see,
I'm gonna be so right for you girl,
[Verse 2]
Maybe I don't ask,
You about your day,
Maybe I act like I don't care,
Girl I really do,
I just got a whole lot on my mind right now,
Baby I don't want,
You to go away,
Everything is wrong if you're not there,
Tell me what you want,
And I'm gonna try to give it all to you somehow,
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm aware that they're some faults in this relationship,
Where I could try a bit harder than I do and so I'm telling you,
[Chorus]
I'm not,
I'm not perfect,
Just making sure with me,
Baby please,
I'm gonna be so right for you girl,
So im,
So imperfect,
Just don't give up on me,
You will see,
I'm gonna be so right for you girl,
[Verse 3]
I know,
You can do better than me,
But I don't want nobody but you,
And I know,
You don't think I appreciate you,
Let me show you that is not true,
[Chorus x2]
I'm not,
I'm not perfect,
Just making sure with me,
Baby please,
I'm gonna be so right for you girl,
So im,
So imperfect,
Just don't give up on me,
You will see,
I'm gonna be so right for you girl,
I'm not,
I'm not perfect,
Just making sure with me,
Baby please,
I'm gonna be so right for you girl,
So im,
So imperfect,
Just don't give up on me,
You will see,
I'm gonna be so right for you girl,
