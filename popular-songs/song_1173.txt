One, two, three, four
Out on the street corner
Just like every mornin' I sit here and watch you walk my way
And even though I don't know ya you get closer
I swear I feel my heart start racin', achin'
Maybe it's in my mind and maybe I'm only dreamin'
But I swear you catch my eye as you walk on by
Oh, why you gotta leave me so blue
And baby why can't you see that I'm the only one for you?
You could search the world over you'll never find another so true
'Cause if you're lookin' for love I'm standin' right in front of you
Standin' right in front of you
I bet you hurt like mine
'Cause you're broken by someone you never should've given it to, oh no
So we put up a wall to keep from fallin' so hard
It's so sad 'cause there's such good love inside
And I've been hopin' that I might find someone that feels the same way
Someone to share my life on this beautiful ride
Together we could see it all through
And baby why can't you see that I'm the only one for you?
You could search the world over you'll never find another so true
'Cause if you're lookin' for love I'm standin' right in front of you
Standin' right in front of you
So this mornin' I'm just gonna walk up to say hello to you
'Cause if given a chance between love and bein' alone
I know which one, I know which one I'd choose
And give me a chance I'll be a better man for you
I believe I would
And open your heart girl, let me make your dreams come true
You could search the world over but I could take you to the moon
'Cause if you're lookin' for love I'm standin' right in front on you
Yes I am baby, standin' right in front of you
Open your eyes I'm
Standin' right in front of you
Just give me a chance baby
Standin' right in front of you
