Every now and then I get a little lost
My strings all get tangled, my wires all get crossed
Every now and then I'm right up on the edge
Dangling my toes out over the ledge
I just thank God you're here
'Cause when I'm a bullet shot out of a gun
'Cause when I'm a firecracker comin' undone
Or when I'm a fugitive ready to run, all wild-eyed and crazy
No matter where my reckless soul takes me, baby you save me
It's hard lovin' a man that's got a gypsy soul
I don't know how you do it, I'm not sure how you know
The perfect thing to say to save me from myself
You're the angel that believes in me like nobody else
And I thank God you do
'Cause when I'm a bullet shot out of a gun
When I'm a firecracker comin' undone
When I'm a fugitive ready to run, all wild-eyed and crazy
No matter where my reckless soul takes me, baby you save me
I know I don't tell you nearly enough
But I couldn't live one day without your love
When I'm a ship tossed around on the waves
Up on a high wire that's ready to break
When I've had just about all I can take
Baby you, baby you save me
When I'm a bullet shot out of a gun
When I'm a firecracker comin' undone
When I'm a fugitive ready to run, all wild-eyed and crazy
No matter where my reckless soul takes me, baby you save me
