I'm gon' change, I'm gon' change
I'm gon' change, I'm gon' change
You said you're sick and tired of me
That I gotta leave, I wasn't doin' my part
I tried to dig deep inside of me
Hopin' that I can see, how I was breaking your heart
Now, my friends think I'm trippin', they think I'm slippin'
But they just don't understand
That when I'm with you, it feels right
You make me feel like, like I'm a man
I'll do anything you want me to
Girl, I'm here to show and prove
I never wanna leave you, girl, I wanna please you
I just wanna see you right here next to me
Baby, tell me what to do, I wanna be with you
I know I messed it up before, but I'm gon' change
Oh baby, I was so untrue, I'll make it up to you
I know I messed it up before, but baby, I'm gon' change
Now girl, you took a part of me
That it ain't hard to see, to see I'm losin' my head
I'm all alone with thoughts inside of me
Can't get 'em out of me, I'm missin' you in my bed
I know your friends say to leave me, and they made it seem easy
But baby, you don't understand
That when you're with me it feels right, I'll make you feel like
No other man can
I'll do, anything you want me to
Girl, I'm here to show and prove
I never wanna leave you, girl, I wanna please you
I just wanna see you right here next to me
Baby, tell me what to do, I wanna be with you
I know I messed it up before but I'm gonna change
Oh baby, I was so untrue, I'll make it up to you
I know I messed it up before, but baby, I'm gon' change
Let me explain, baby, I will never do it again
If I could, I'd take all the pain because I know I hurt you
Girl, I told all those lies and for all those times I made you cry
Baby, I apologize, because you're everything to me, baby
Baby, tell me what to do, I wanna be with you
I know I messed it up before but I'm gon' change
Oh baby, I was so untrue, I'll make it up to you
I know I messed it up before, but baby, I'm gon' change
Tell me what to do, I wanna be with you
I know I messed it up before but I'm gon' change
Oh baby, I was so untrue, I'll make it up to you
I know I messed it up before, but baby, I'm gon' change
