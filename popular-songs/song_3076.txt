(Verse 1)
Turn my back to the door
Feel so much better now
Don't even try anymore
Nothin' left to lose
As the voice that's in the air
Sayin' don't look back no where
Theres a voice that's always there 
And I'll never be quite the same as I was before
This part of you still remains oh it's out of focus
Your just somewhere that I've been
And I won't go back again 
Your just somewhere that I've been
(Chorus)
I'm breathin' in, breathin' out
Ain't that what its all about?
Livin' life crazy loud
Like I have the right to 
No more words in my mouth
Nothin' left to figure out
That I don't think I'll ever break through
The ghost of you
(Verse 2)
And I'll never be like I was the day I met you
To naive? Yes I was
Boy, that's why I let you in
Wear your memory like a stain
Can't erase none of the pain
Here to stay with me forever
(Chorus) 
Breathin' in, breathin' out
Ain't that what it's all about?
Livin' life crazy loud
Like I have the right to
No more words in my mouth
Nothin' left to figure out
That I don't think I'll ever break through
The ghost of you
(Bridge) 
One of these days
I'll wake up from this bad dream I'm dreamin'
One of these days I pray that I'll be, over,over,over you
One of these days I'll realize that I'm to tired of 
Feelin' confused
But for now there's a reason
That you're still here in my heart
(Chorus)
Breathin' in, breathin' out
Ain't that what it's all about?
Livin' life crazy loud
Like I have the right to 
Know the words in my mouth
Nothin' left for me to doubt
That I don't think I'll ever break through
The ghost of you
Breathin' in , breathin' out 
Breathin' in, breathin' out 
Like I have the right to 
No more words in my mouth 
Nothin' left to figure out
But I don't think I'll ever break through 
The the ghost of you
