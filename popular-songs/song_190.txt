Hangin' out at the old park pool
Right after Sunday school
Banana Boat, a rubber float
Another summer afternoon
Bonfire at the creek tonight
Bubba bringin' some homemade wine
Just enough to catch a buzz
And get us countrified
Oh, my my, that's just the way we do it
Cut off Levi's and kickin' country music
Miles from nowhere, there ain't no city limits
And that's where you're gonna find us havin' a small town big time
A population 903
Half of them are kin to me
And those that ain't, they know my name
We're like one big family
Gather at that old campsite
To lie about the fish and their size
Uncle Carl and his old guitar
Singin', 'Louisiana Saturday Night'
Oh, my my, that's just the way we do it
Cut off Levi's and kickin' country music
Miles from nowhere, there ain't no city limits
And that's where you're gonna find us havin' a small town big time
Oh, my my, that's just the way we do it
Cut off Levi's and kickin' country music
Miles from nowhere, there ain't no city limits
And that's where you're gonna find us havin' a small town big time
A small town big time
