Three wise men, a shining star
A mother and a father who had come so far
How could they know about their son
And the miracle He'd become
That He held the soul of man
In His tiny little hands
One child one day
And the universe will never be the same
From Bethlehem
And the Angels' voices rejoicing in His name
Oh and I believe with all my heart
That He will show the way
And you and I will meet
One child one day
A small white church, a mountainside
Cathedrals filled with music and golden light
Oh, we gather everywhere
For the peace that's always there
For the story that is told
Of a birth so long ago
One child one day
And the universe will never be the same
From Bethlehem
And the angels' voices rejoicing in His name
Oh and I believe with all my heart
That He will show the way
And you and I will meet
One child one day
Oh and I believe with all my heart
That He will show the way
Oh and you and I will meet
One child one day
One child one day
One child one day
One child one day
