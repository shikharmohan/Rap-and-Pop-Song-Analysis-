Chorus x2:
Yall know I am (blowin up the spot)
I'm that young man (blowin up the spot)
just for my fans I'm blowin up the spot
15 cent (blowin up the spot)
Allow me to introduce myself,
they call me 15 dime and a nickel,
what's around my neck colder than a icecicle,
yeah bring his truck on them 50 inch spinners,
I got more green than a holiday dinner,
ya know I'm not selfish yall,
I'm signed to Wizard Kelly I can't help but ball,
aw I'm as dry as they come,
love then proud bill teen idol wassup,
but the others like sure he's hard,
'cause I got guards to guard my security guards,
SUV's wit sweet hydro's,
iced out watch for each time zone,
new pair of shoes erday of the week,
I undock my yacht to get away from the beach,
ya dig yeah like a deep trip,
this is how you make a dolla out of 15 cent
(chorus)
A yo guess who's bizack up in that paul village,
hot as a skillet know how I did it,
how did I get it if you aint seen it yet,
I got a see through roof plus my seats eject,
i could divide tha insider ow
push the button and raise the limosine glass,
so there's no need to wonder who's higher,
hear the sound of money when I come to a stop,
what's a proud beat without 15 pennies,
get it 15 pennies,
trust me man 15 friendly,
I'm the type to hang ya 15 out my 20, 
Penny don't let the baggy jeans fool you,
I can still give you sonethin to move to,
so stay put like cement,
this is how you make a dolla out of 15 cent
(chorus)

oh I like to give a out shout to my record company,
Wiz Kelly, Sir Paid Alot,
