Times are tough on an honest heart
People don't follow through with what they start
Lyin' eyes looking at me up and down
Makin' talk that's only cheap
Makin' promises they never keep
But I keep lookin' for what I still haven't found
One honest heart that I can believe in
Two lovin' arms that will never let me go
One good man that I can count on
It shouldn't be so hard, finding one honest heart
Now, I've been close a time or two
I thought I saw my dreams comin' true
But I was just livin' in a fairy tale
I won't play the fool again
I won't play a game that I can't win
But I still have faith and I keep tellin' myself, there's
One honest heart that I can believe in
Two lovin' arms that will never let me go
One good man that I can count on
It shouldn't be so hard, finding one honest heart
I don't think I'm asking too much
Just once in my life I want to be touched by
One honest heart that I can believe in
Two lovin' arms that will never let me go
One good man that I can count on
It shouldn't be so hard
It shouldn't be so hard, finding one honest heart
One good man
One honest heart
One good man
One honest heart
