Turn out the light, turn yourself over to me
Turn off the world while I turn my feelings free
Just enjoy the pleasure, for the pleasure pleases me
You've been turning me on all night long, now it's my turn
You have reached the woman in me through the man in you
Let me be that woman before the lovin's through
You just turn yourself over to me while I turn my feelings free
You've been turning me on all night long, now it's my turn
All night long, I've been driven to your touch
Haven't had time to give, I've been taking so much
I know you want to hold me but darlin', you've done enough
You've been turning me on all night long, now it's my turn
You have reached the woman in me through the man in you
Let me be that woman before the lovin's through
You just turn yourself over to me while I turn my feelings free
You've been turning me on all night long, now it's my turn
You just turn yourself over to me while I turn my feelings free
You've been turning me on all night long, now it's my turn
