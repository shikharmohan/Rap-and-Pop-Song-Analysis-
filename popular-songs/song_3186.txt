Man, I can't even picture myself, not breathin, but its certain.
I love too much I love to many to count em'
So extras and pets it's easy for me to go on without em
Cuz everything goes away 
Love it eventually gets stowed away
Why does it have to be when you're breathin when even
And then you're heated wonderin why is it cold today
Immortal is fake and impossible but everytime I look up I'm seein an obstacle
Whats gonna happen when time is up an I gots to go
Beautiful lands are took away from my opticle
Its not that I'm afraid of death but afraid of the thought of my people laid to rest 
They saying there is 6 million ways of death but not even one way to fade the stress	
Its certain that a person got somebody lookin workin to close the curtain 	
Or maybe something out of some dream with a devilish soul for hurtin
Sometime i be wishin i didn't love
Cuz when its away i be missin love
your mother your father your children are livin to die from the crib and the ditches dug
From the process i get nauseous cuz i can't see my death and its causes 
Pac he saw it around the corner but me not breathin is a pound of balogna
I keep fightin and im tryin to get right in my mind brian	
Cuz one day im gonna see you even tho i can't picture the N9ne dyin
Im flyin
Far far away from here
nothin i can do about it
everything i love go away from here
wishin i could do without it
i think you gonna go 
Far far away from here
nothin i can do about it
everything i love go away from here
wishin i could do without it

see i tried to call for your father, but nobody answered
and i tried to scream out loud, but nobody pampered
but your leaving tomorrow and im just a youngsta deep in the sorrow and
nobody wants to die
and i gotta try to get away from the pain im never escapin the
maybe i did to much to you you you by forsakin ya
and now i see a reflection of you off my son
Cuz he the same complexion and you color up the sun
and now im done baby makin hatin it to even see my baby sleep
cuz he gotta die one day your buried dead and deep
and im stay too far away from him
spent too many days from him
tears steadily fallin im creatin em'
and its gettin colder your gettin older year by year
never know when you gotta go far away from here
listen here
Far far away from here
nothin i can do about it
everything i love go away from here
wishin i could do without it
i think you gonna go 
Far far away from here
nothin i can do about it
everything i love go away from here
wishin i could do without it
