When I was a boy
Four houses down from me
Was a family with an only child
She was the only girl
In this whole world that can make me smile
Down the road
I made up reasons to go
Down the road
Somewhere inside of me
There was something she took a liking to
Well, I ask her to marry me
She said she really wanted to
Down the road
See what life's gonna hold
Down the road
Her momma wants to know
Am I washed in the blood or just in the water?
Her daddy wants to know
If I make enough to take his daughter
Down the road
Before he could let her go
Down the road
And now down the street from here
There's an engineer with an only son
And our baby girl says
She believes that he is the only one
Down the road
Her momma wants to know
Is he washed in the blood or just in the water?
And I wanna know
That he makes enough to take my daughter
Down the road
When it comes time to go
Down the road
Down the road
You know I wanna help her go
Down the road
Down, down, down that road
Down, down, down that road
