ItÃÂ¢€s really good to see you
Your lookin just as good as I recall
Naw ... nothingÃÂ¢€s really changed here at all
I heard you moved to Pheonix
So whatcha doing back here in this nowhere town?
And are you staying at your MommaÃÂ¢€s house?
Me oh yeah yeah IÃÂ¢€ve been doing fine
You should know me well enough to know IÃÂ¢€m lyinÃÂ¢€
The lights turn red and the lights turn green
The sun comes up and shines on everything
Every day ... Every day
And I still donÃÂ¢€t know what to do about the way I feel about you
Some things ainÃÂ¢€t ever gonna change
Some things ainÃÂ¢€t ever gonna change
Yeah I still see your Daddy
I help him fix his old tractor now and then
Naw ... they donÃÂ¢€t make em anymore like the two of them
I love to hear him talk about you
I could listen to his stories all day long
Yeah ItÃÂ¢€s almost like you ainÃÂ¢€t never been gone
We both know you have to walk away
But God knows IÃÂ¢€m gonna love you anyway
The lights turn red and the lights turn green
The sun comes up and shines on everything
Every day ... Every day
And I still donÃÂ¢€t know what to do about the way I feel about you
Some things ainÃÂ¢€t ever gonna change
Some things ainÃÂ¢€t ever gonna change
ItÃÂ¢€s really good to see you
Your looking just as good as I recall
Naw ... nothingÃÂ¢€s really changed here at all
