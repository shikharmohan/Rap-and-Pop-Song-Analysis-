Honey, I'd love to change your name
Make yours and mine one in the same
Ain't nothin' else about you I'd ever wanna change
Honey, I'd sure love to change your name
Do you believe in love at first sight?
I don't think that I did, not until tonight
When I saw you dancin' on that hard wood floor
Kickin' your heels up, I knew it was love forever more
Honey, I'd love to change your name
Make yours and mine one in the same
Ain't nothin' else about you I'd ever wanna change
Honey, I'd sure love to change your name
You're probably thinkin' I'm some kind of fool
Well, you're right, darlin', I'm a fool for you
You buy this line, babe, I'll buy you a ring
Get on my knees and beg you, please, to marry me
Honey, I'd love to change your name
Make yours and mine one in the same
Ain't nothin' else about you I'd ever wanna change
Honey, I'd sure love to change your name
Honey, I'd love to change your name
Make yours and mine one in the same
Ain't nothin' else about you I'd ever wanna change
But honey, I'd sure love to change your name
Yeah and honey, I'd sure love to change your name
