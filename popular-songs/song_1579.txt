love,it's a 4-lettered word 
it is used rarely from me
I think your special 
  guys that I know 
you'll say baby I'll hold you close 
and you wont ditch me 
for your friends 
you are the guy that I need 
and you should listen to me when I say 
our love would be like a fairytale 
the one that never ends 
just like cind-er-ellie 
or maybe beauty and the beast 
we would be like pencil and paper 
inseparable,invincible
baby can't you see 
I was made for you 
you were made for me 
it's a love story 
please believe me 
when I say 
our love is like a fairytale 
the one that never ends 
just like cind-er-ellie 
or maybe beauty and the beast 
we me and you you and I 
we were meant to be 
baby can't you see 
our love is like a fairytale 
the one that never ends 
me and you,you and me 
together for ever 
inlove forever 
were  invincible to me
