Hail Caesar shadow on my backseat
And her friends are standing right in front of me
World wide from the center burning turkey [unverified]
Open up, said everybody loves me
And you don't have to make a sound
'Cause they got what you need
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Gotta love all the people that have warned you
Gotta love all your sentimental virtue
Eight balls with the takers that'll make you
Lay cards with the lovers that'll hate you
'Cause you don't have to make a sound
They got what you need, what you need
Like you say
Oh my, feels just like I don't try
Looks so good I might die
All I know is everybody loves me
Get down, swaying to my own sound
Flashes in my face now
All I know is everybody loves me
Everybody loves me
Well I, play the music, don't stop till I turn gray
Stars forever like John Sousa never fade
He had a beautiful child, named her Desiree
Hope I'll remember the good things that I'll never say
'Cause you don't have to make a sound
They got what you need
Like you say
Oh my, feels just like I don't try
Looks so good I might die
All I know is everybody loves me
Get down, swaying to my own sound
Flashes in my face now
All I know is everybody loves me
Everybody loves me
Everybody
Everybody, oh
Everybody
Everybody
Don't need my health
Got my name and got my wealth
I stare at the sun
Just for kicks all by myself
I lose track of time
So I might be past my prime
But I'm feeling, oh so good
Yeah
Oh my, feels just like I don't try
Looks so good I might die
All I know is everybody loves me
Get down, swaying to my own sound
Flashes in my face now
All I know is everybody loves me
Everybody loves me
Don't you know you wanna?
Everybody
Everybody
Everybody
Whoa, yeah
