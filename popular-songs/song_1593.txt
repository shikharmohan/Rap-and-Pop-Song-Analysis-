Oh baby when we are together,
when i know you're at my side,
I feel i can do anything,
But i now i know you lied.
I want to believe you,
but my head just won't let it be,
no matter what my heart wants,
baby can't you see?
Chorus:
But when it's late at night,
and i'm thinking of you,
I just look up to the stars,
and i know what to do.
So just look up at the stars,
they will help heal our scars.
I want to forgive you,
But i know it can't be done,
because deep inside us both,
the light no longer shone.
But now we can move on,
and be happy just as friends,
because no matter what you did,
i don't want us to end. 
Chorus:
But when it's late at night,
and I'm thinking of you,
I just look up to the stars,
and i know what to do.
So just look up at the stars,
they will help heal our scars.
But when it's late at night,
and I'm thinking of you,
I just look up to the stars,
and i know what to do.
So just look up at the stars,
they will help heal our scars.
So don't forget at night,
The stars will be your light.
