[Verse: 1]
Pull up your pants
(Just Like Em')
Take out the trash
(Just Like Em')
You can dig cash like em'
Fast like em'
Girl you outta act like ya dig
(What I'm talkin' bout')
Security codes on everything
Vibrate so your phone don't ever ring
(Joint Account)
And another one he don't know about
[Hook]
Wish we could switch up the roles
And I could be that...
Tell you I love you
But when you call I never get back
Would you ask them questions like me?...
Like where you be at?
Cause I'm out 4 in the morning
On the corna roll'n
Do'n my own thing
Ohh
[Chorus]
What if I?
Had a thing on the side?
Made ya cry?
Would the rules change up?
Or would they still apply?
If I played you like a toy?
Sometimes I wish I did act like a boy
Can't be get'n mad!
What You Mad?
Can't Handle that!
Can't be get'n mad!
What you mad?
Can't handle that!
[Verse: 2]
Girl go head and be...
(Just Like Em')
Go run the streets
(Just Like Em')
come home late say sleep like em'
Creep like em'
Front with ya friends
Act hard when you're with em' like em'
(What)
Keep a straight face when ya tell a lie
Always keep an airtight alibi
(Keep Him In The Dark)
What he don't know won't break his heart
[Hook]
Wish we could switch up the roles
And I could be that...
Tell you I love you
But when you call I never get back
Would you ask them questions like me?...
Like where you be at?
Cause I'm out 4 in the morning
On the corna roll'n
Do'n my own thing
Yeah
[Chorus]
What if I?
Had a thing on the side? (what if I)
Made ya cry?
Would the rules change up? (made ya cry)
Or would they still apply?
If I played you like a toy?
Sometimes I wish I did act like a boy (LIKE A BOY)
Can't be get'n mad!
What You Mad?
Can't Handle that!
Can't be get'n mad!
What you mad?
Can't handle that!
Can't be get'n mad!
What you mad?
Can't handle that!
Can't be get'n mad!
What you mad?
Can't handle that!
[Bridge]
If I was always gone
If the sun beat me home
(Would Ya Like That?)
Told you I was with my crew
When I knew it wasn't true
(Would Ya Like That?)
If I act like you
Walk a mile off in yo shoes
(Would Ya Like That?)
I'm mess'n with your head again
Dose of your medicine
[Chorus]
What if I?
Had a thing on the side? ( what if I I)
Made ya cry? ( Made ya cry)
Would the rules change up?
Or would they still apply?
If I played you like a toy?
Sometimes I wish I did act like a boy (ACT LIKE A BOY)
Can't be get'n mad!
What You Mad?
Can't Handle that!
Can't be get'n mad!
What you mad?
Can't handle that!
Can' Can't be get'n mad! (uh)
What you mad? (C)
Can't handle that! (I)
Can't be get'n mad! (A)
What you mad? 
Can't handle that! (R-A come on)
(Itsa crutch)
If I played you...
Would yo like that?
Had friends...
Would you like that?
Never call?
Would you like that?
No no
You wouldn't like that
No!
What if I?
Had a thing on the side?
Made ya cry!
Would the rules change up?
Or would they still apply!
What if I...
If I played you like a toy
Sometimes I wish I did act like a boy!
Can't Handle That
