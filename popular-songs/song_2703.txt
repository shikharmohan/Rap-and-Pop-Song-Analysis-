Well, I could swear this king size bed keeps gettin' wider
And I could swear a stranger's laying by my side
And I could swear a long dark valley lies between us
And there ain't no way to cross the great divide
The great divide ain't in Colorado
It's the distance that we've somehow grown apart
The great divide, oh, that river's sorrow
We can't rebuild the bridge we've burned between our hearts
Now Lord, knows we're both tryin' hard at crossin' over
But pride runs as deep as it is wide
And the love that once could conquer any mountain
Has reached the edge of the great divide
The great divide ain't in Colorado
It's the distance that we've somehow grown apart
The great divide, oh, that river's sorrow
We can't rebuild the bridge we've burned between our hearts
The great divide ain't in Colorado
