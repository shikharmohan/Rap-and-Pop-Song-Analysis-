Over do it and have a fit

Beat me outta me, beat me outta me
Come on over and do the twist
Over do it and have a fit
Love you so much it makes me sick
Come on over and shoot the shit
Beat me outta me, beat me outta me
Beat me outta me, beat me outta me
Beat me outta me, beat me outta me
Beat me outta me, beat me outta me
