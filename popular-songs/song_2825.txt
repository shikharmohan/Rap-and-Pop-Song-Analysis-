Darling could I just have one moment with you
We're here all alone just us two
Let me try to tell you in a few little words
How my heart feels about you
If there were no rainbow, I'd paint one for you
And I'd teach the robin a new song or two
Then I'd fight forever and hand it to you
Oh, I wish there was more could do
You've got me right where you want me
It's true I'm right in the palm of your hand
You've got me right where you want me to be
And I want to be right where I am
You've got me right where you want me to be
And I want to be right where I am
