And Ne-yo is like Young Michael, I'm Quincy hoe
Now hear the flow that broke the Da Vinci Code
I'm psycho, everything I wrote go together, so nice
Like a wedding make you wanna throw rice
I'm schitzo, cuckoo clock don't tick so
Write sometimes 'til the chicks noodles
I got screws loose
I pull words out the air like blue tooth
I'm a sandwich short of a picnic
Ignorant thoughts come across
You've sworn that I written this but I didn't
So maybe it's good to be crazy
Isn't it, baby?
I wrote your name on my wall
3000 times last night
You were on my mind
That's what you do to me
That's what you do
That's what you do to me
That's what you
Then one by one I went down the line
Just repeating it
'Cause it makes me smile
That's what you do to me
That's what you do
That's what you do to me
That's what you
Some say that it's just strange
To act that way
But they don't understand
No, they don't get it
You're so magnetic, though it's pathetic
To them I simply turn and say
Just call me crazy
Insane, deranged
It don't matter to me
Call it what you want to, I don't care
And it doesn't make a difference
Long as she's there
Just call me crazy
Lovin' you is crazy
Crazy is what I'll be
Ohh, crazy, ohh crazy, ohh
Just call me crazy
Lately it seems
Like every song I write is about you
Ohh, I love your style
That's what you do to me
That's what you do
That's what you do to me
That's what you do
And it just don't make no sense
How my swagger is crooked
If you ain't by my side
That's what you do to me
That's what you do
That's what you do to me
That's what you do
Just call me crazy
Insane, deranged
It don't matter to me
Call it what you want to, I don't care
And it doesn't make a difference
Long as she's there
Just call me crazy
Lovin' you is crazy
Crazy is what I'll be
Ohh, crazy, ohh crazy, ohh
Just call me crazy
I talk to your picture
Ohh, write your name in the mirror
Right after I love you down
I need you so much
Can't get enough
Just call me crazy
Insane, deranged
It don't matter to me
Call it what you want to, I don't care
And it doesn't make a difference
Long as she's there
Just call me crazy
Lovin' you is crazy
Crazy is what I'll be
Ohh, crazy, ohh crazy, ohh
Just call me crazy
