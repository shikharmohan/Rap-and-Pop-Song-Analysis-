A 1986 Harley
Blowin' smoke and suckin' oil
My daddy said, "Buy it and you're crazy, boy"
Can't tell me nothin'
It took two months to fix it up
And one day to lay her down
I got a little hitch in my get-along now
Can't tell me nothin'
Talk is cheap and free advice
Is worth the price you pay
I had to find out for myself the hard way
Can't tell me nothin'
Hometown homecoming sweetheart
Nobody thought I had a prayer
Her mama said, "Boy, don't you come around here"
Can't tell me nothin'
They say be careful what you wish for
I wanted to be her man
Now two babies and a trailer later, here I am
Can't tell me nothin'
Talk is cheap and free advice
Is worth the price you pay
I had to find out for myself the hard way
Can't tell me nothin'
They say that drinkin'll kill you
The same thing for rollin' smoke
That's two of the three things I like most
Can't tell me nothin'
I know what the Good Book preaches
But I know how I am
I sure hope somebody up there understands
Can't tell me nothin'
Can't tell me nothin'
