It's been a long time
Since we walked that aisle together
And you became my wife
And who would've thought
You would fall for someone just like me
For the best days of my life
I may not be a poet
'Cause I ain't so good on words
I may not stand before you like
A knight in shining armor
I may not be the best of singers
There's better guys I've heard
But I know how to love, I know how to
Love you well
You got your faults
And I don't need to tell you I've got mine
But I guess they all even out
Wherever I ride
The thought of you turns water into wine
And somehow I lose a crowd
I may not drive a fancy car
I don't know what it's for
I may not be the one who gets to
Shower you with diamonds
I may not be a rich man
But you can't call me poor
'Cause I know how to love, I know
How to love you well
And as we skip the light fandango
From that ol' jukebox by the bar
Now honey, don't it make you wonder
How we ever got this far
I may not be a poet
'Cause I ain't got much to say
I may not stand before you like that
Knight in shining armor
I may not be the best of singers
Honey, that's okay
'Cause I know how to love
I know how to love
I know how to love you well
