This desert lies it's so unfair
I think there's water everywhere
I'm always fooled
Just when I think I'm saved
But I don't have the strength to do again
What always comes undone
Deliver me please be the One
I've thought I wasted all those prayers
Till I looked up and You were there
Oh, in Your eyes
I see there's hope for me
I need Your love to finish off
What others have begun
Deliver me please be the One
Be the One who makes me see
Be wonderful a reason
Be the One who rescues me
With a love I can believe in
Let it be true that You can do
What no one else has done
Deliver me please be the One
Deliver me please be the One
