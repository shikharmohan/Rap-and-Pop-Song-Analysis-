It's all around you now, but you don't know it 
It's tugging at your heart, but you don't show it
It's just a matter of time
It's gonna hit you right between the eyes
You'll wake up in the middle of the night
I'll be the only thing on your mind
Won't be able to shake it loose
When love gets a hold of you
Before you have your first cup of coffee
You're gonna pick up the phone and call me
Won't believe what you say and do
When love gets a hold of you
Cause it's gonna be written all over your face
All your friends gonna tell you how much you've changed
Feeling things that you can't deny
Going crazy and you don't know why
You'll wake up in the middle of the night
I'll be the only thing on your mind
Won't be able to shake it loose
When love gets a hold of you
Before you have your first cup of coffee
You're gonna pick up the phone and call me
Won't believe what you say and do
When love gets a hold of you
It gets a hold of you
It's just a matter of time
It's gonna hit you right between the eyes
You're driving home at the end of the day
You'll find yourself coming by my place
Yeah, you always have a good excuse
When love gets a hold of you
Once you're standing inside my door
Won't remember what you came here for
Can't control what you say and do
When love gets a hold of you
Yeah gets a hold of you
Gets a hold of you
Gets a hold of you
Oh it gets a hold of you
