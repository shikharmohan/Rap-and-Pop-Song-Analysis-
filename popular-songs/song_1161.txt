Well, there ain't no strangers
When you're swinging a hammer side by side
Yeah, we had a little setback
But ain't nothing gonna stop this southern pride, no, no
So people let's pull together now boys
Once again this town's gonna make some noise
We'll be square-dancing, toe tappin'
We'll be kickin' up our heels to the 'Cotton-Eyed Joe'
Music and laughter gonna raise the rafter
There's a little boot sliding across the floor
Do a little hand holding, hay-rolling
Strolling with your honey by your side
Dixie cups and paper plates fiddle tunes in 'Amazing Grace'
Hallelujah, gonna raise the barn tonight, yeah
Well, Lord, he was willing
But to creep the rides up anyhow
Yeah, the bossman don't seem to care
So it's up to us to gather 'round
The stars'll shine a little brighter than before
It's gonna come alive when we swing open the door
And we'll be square-dancing, toe tappin'
We'll be kickin' up our heels to the 'Cotton-Eyed Joe'
Music and laughter gonna raise the rafter
A little boot sliding across the floor
Do a little hand holding, hay-rolling
Strolling with your honey by your side
Dixie cups and paper plates fiddle tunes in 'Amazing Grace'
Hallelujah, gonna raise the barn tonight
So people let's pull together now boys
Once again this town's gonna make some noise
Everybody makes some noise
And we'll be square-dancing, toe tappin'
We'll be kickin' up our heels to the 'Cotton-Eyed Joe'
Music and laughter gonna raise the rafter
A little boot sliding across the floor
Do a little hand holding, hay-rolling
Strolling with your honey by your side
Dixie cups and paper plates fiddle tunes in 'Amazing Grace'
Hallelujah, gonna raise the barn tonight, yeah
Come on now let's gather 'round
Gonna give it up and all throw down
Hallelujah gonna raise the barn tonight, yeah
Raise the barn tonight
Raise the barn tonight
