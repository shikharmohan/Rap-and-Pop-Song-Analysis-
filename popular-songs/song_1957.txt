Everybody in the club right now, tell the DJ to turn it loud
Baby girl, this your favorite song, baby girl, this your favorite song
This for girls who got their own car, this for girls who got their own crib
This for girls who got their own
If you came here by yourself tonight
'Cause he wouldn't pick up the phone
He was supposed to bring you here tonight
Couldn't find him so you came alone
It don't matter cause' you're here now
And the music you're enjoying
So for the next couple minutes
Baby I'mma be your boyfriend
Pretty mama if you're single, single
You don't gotta be alone tonight
So while the DJ play that single, single
Just pretend that I'm you're man tonight
See you don't got to be alone, I'll be your boyfriend
See you don't got to be alone, girl I'll be your boyfriend
See you don't got to be alone, baby I'll be your boyfriend
Be your boyfriend till the song goes off
See you don't got to be alone, I'll be your boyfriend
See you don't got to be alone, girl I'll be your boyfriend
See you don't got to be alone, baby I'll be your boyfriend
Be your boyfriend till the song goes off
Hey, be your boyfriend till the song goes off
He don't tell you that you're beautiful
Let me tell you to the beat
He don't tell you that he loves you, girl
Let me sing it in a harmony
Let my song get you higher
We don't have to come back down
And if ever you should miss me
Just tell the DJ run it back now
Pretty mama, if you're single, single
You don't gotta be alone tonight
So while the DJ run this single, single
Just pretend that I'm you're man tonight
See you don't got to be alone, I'll be your boyfriend
See you don't got to be alone, girl I'll be your boyfriend
See you don't got to be alone, baby I'll be your boyfriend
Be your boyfriend till the song goes off
See you don't got to be alone, I'll be your boyfriend
See you don't got to be alone, girl I'll be your boyfriend
See you don't got to be alone, baby I'll be your boyfriend
Be your boyfriend till the song goes off
Be your boyfriend till the song goes off
Be your boyfriend till the song goes off
