Daily grind is stealin' me away again
When I just wanna lay back down
Another night gone and don't know where it went
What I need more than anything right now is
Time with you, more time with you
To laugh and talk and play and make more love to you
Oh, there's nothing in this world I'd rather do
Than spend time with you
Seven days, you and me in paradise
The world revolving around us
We'd still be there and forever if the choice was mine
'Cause seven days, that's not enough
Time with you, more time with you
To laugh and talk and play and make more love to you
Oh, there's nothing in this world I'd rather do
Than spend time with you, time with you
I'm gone for now to do the things I have to do
But baby, you know I live for
Time with you, more time with you
To laugh and talk and play and make more love to you
Oh, there's nothing in this world I'd rather do
Than spend time with you, more time with you
