Midnight
It started out like any other day
But it was anythin' but
Somethin' 'bout the way the moon was shinin'
Somethin' seems so different, no
Got in my car but didn't have no reason
Swear I was drivin' but somethin' else was leadin' me
Lost all track of time, damn
The next thing, you won't believe
At 9 o'clock, I saw her
By 10, I had her number
11's when I called her
At 12 o'clock, it happened, I gotta blame
Midnight, I was caught up
It's like I couldn't help myself if I wanted to
  (Blame it on midnight)
If she found out about us, would it be a good excuse?
  (Midnight)
It's 12 o'clock, tick tock tick, the clothes drop
She's on top and I don't even wanna stop, no
Made me disregard and break my baby's heart
I know I did wrong but I blame it on midnight
Still here I know I'm in trouble
But I'ma finish what I started
My heart is tellin' me to leave here
But my body's sayin' stay longer
We goin' strong while my cell phone's blowin' up
I know it's wrong but somethin' else is leadin' me
Lost all track of time, damn
The sex is just too good to leave
At 1 o'clock, I'm in it
2 o'clock, still in it
Then 3 o'clock, I'm finished
At 4 o'clock, I'm drivin' home, I gotta blame
Midnight, I was caught up
It's like I couldn't help myself if I wanted to
  (Blame it on midnight)
If she found out about us, would it be a good excuse?
  (Midnight)
It's 12 o'clock, tick tock tick, the clothes drop
She's on top and I don't even wanna stop, no
Made me disregard and break my baby's heart
I know I did wrong but I blame it on midnight
What have ya done, it's 5 A.M., oh
Hookin' up wit somebody that you don't even know
How you gonna get yourself outta this one
You got a girl at home
I can blame it on my car breakin' down or
I can say I was workin' late and didn't know
That you was waitin' up, I never showed up
Girl, I know it's my fault
Midnight, I was caught up
It's like I couldn't help myself if I wanted to
  (Blame it on midnight)
If she found out about us, would it be a good excuse?
