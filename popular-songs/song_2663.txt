The greatest man I never knew lived just down the hall
And everyday we said hello but never touched at all
He was in his paper, I was in my room
How was I to know he thought I hung the moon
The greatest man I never knew, came home late every night
He never had too much to say, too much was on his mind
I never really knew him and now it seems so sad
Everything he gave to us took all he had
Then the days turned into years
And the memories to black and white
He grew cold like an old winter wind
Blowing across my life
The greatest words I never heard I guess I'll never hear
The man I thought could never die is been dead almost a year
He was good at business but there was business left to do
He never said he loved me guess he thought I knew
