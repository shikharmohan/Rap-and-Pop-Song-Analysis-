What a surprise
Never thought I'd hear from you
Whatever made you call
From out of the blue
What did you say
I must be hearing things
Things that I never thought
Would come from you
Now you tell me
That you love me desperately
Why did you wait so long
To say those words to me
Oh, you made me crazy
I don't know what to do
Now you tell me
Not that there's somebody new
I think you should know
There's someone here with me
O, bet he can tell you
Must be someone dear to me
So I better go
'Cause you still get to me
Just when I thought I was over you
This is all I need
Now you tell me
That you love me desperately
Why did you wait so long
To say those words to me
Oh, you made me crazy
I don't know what to do
Now you tell me
Not that there's somebody new
