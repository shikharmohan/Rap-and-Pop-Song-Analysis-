Peaceful valleys, mountaintops
No dark alleys or sudden stops
This is my prayer
This is my prayer for you
Love is calling, starry skies
Always falling but not for lies
This is my prayer
This is my prayer for you
May all your sweet dreams go unbroken
May every wish you've ever spoken
Come true
This is my prayer
This is my prayer for you
Celebrations, true blue friends
Revelations and a heart that mends
This is my prayer
This is my prayer for you
May all your sweet dreams go unbroken
May every wish you've ever spoken
Come true
'Cause this is my prayer
This is my prayer for you
Arms that welcome, doors opened wide
All your loved ones, gathered by your side
This is my prayer
This is my prayer for you
May all your days be filled with laughter
May all your prayers be quickly answered
This is my prayer
This is my prayer for you
This is my prayer
This is my prayer for you
