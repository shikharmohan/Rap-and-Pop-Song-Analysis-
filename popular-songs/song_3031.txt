Well there's a half moon starlit sky
All the conditions are just right
Our song's playing on the radio
Every beat of my heart is saying just let go
'Cause when you're holding me this way
It's all I can do to just think straight
A little voice in my head is saying not so fast
If you really want this love to last
I'm gonna catch my breath, I'm gonna count to ten
I'm gonna leave you wonderin' you see me again
I'm gonna say goodnight with one passionate kiss
And leave you with the strongest feeling there is
I'll give you something to miss
I'm not doin' something I'll regret
I'm playing it just hard enough to get
I'm gonna give you a little space
And let you enjoy the thrill of the chase
I'm gonna catch my breath, I'm gonna count to ten
I'm gonna leave you wonderin' you see me again
I'm gonna say goodnight with one passionate kiss
And leave you with the strongest feeling there is
I'll give you something to miss
Oh I'm gonna catch my breath, I'm gonna count to ten
I'm gonna leave you wonderin' you see me again
I'm gonna say goodnight with one passionate kiss
And leave you with the strongest feeling there is
I'll give you something to miss
I'm gonna catch my breath, I'm gonna count to ten
I'm gonna leave you wonderin' you see me again
I'm gonna say goodnight with one passionate kiss
And leave you with the strongest feeling there is
I'll give you something, I'll give you something
I'll give you something to miss
Oh I'll give you something to miss
I'll give you something to miss
I'll give you something to miss
I'll give you something to miss
I'll give you something to miss
Something to miss
I'll give you something to miss
