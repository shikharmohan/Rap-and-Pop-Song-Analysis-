Verse 1:
(And i pray)
I just can't sleep tonight,
knowing that things ain't right.
It's in the papers, it's on the TV, 
it's everywhere that i go.
Children are crying, soldiers are dying, 
some people don't have a home.
Pre Chorus:
But i know there's sunshine behind that rain, 
I know there's good times behind that pain (hey)
Can you tell me how i can make a change?
Chorus:
I close my eyes, and i can see a better day,
I close my eyes and pray.
I close my eyes and i can see a better day,
I close my eyes and pray.
Verse 2:
I lose my appetite, knowing kids starve tonight
Am I a sinner? Cause half my dinner,
Is still left on my plate.
Ooh i got a vision, to make a difference,
and it's starting today.
Pre Chorus:
Cause i know there's sunshine beyond that rain, 
I know there's good times beyond that pain
Heaven tell me i can make a change.
Chorus:
I close my eyes, and i can see a better day,
I close my eyes and pray. (yeee)
I close my eyes and i can see a better day,
I close my eyes and
Bridge:
I pray for the broken-hearted,
I pray for the life not started.
I pray for all the ones not breathing,
I pray for all the souls in need.
I pray, can you give em one today?
Pre Chorus:
I just can't sleep tonight, 
Can someone tell me how to make a change?
End Chorus:
I close my eyes, and i can see a better day,
I close my eyes and pray, (Ooh)
I close my eyes and i can see a better day,
I close my eyes and i pray, (ooh)
I pray, I pray
I close my eyes and pray.
