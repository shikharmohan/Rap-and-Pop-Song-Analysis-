(walt aldridge, bruce miller)
We ordered up one more bottle of wine
You told me your story and I thought about mine
You said when you lost her you lost everything
It all started having a familiar ring
So I asked you to take me some place quiet
We wound up at the river for the rest of the night
Somewhere around the break of day
I could hear it coming from a mile away
Chorus:
So don't say that word
Not the one we both heard too much
You may think you do but you don't
It's just the fear of being alone
Reckless hearts can clear a path
Wider than a hurricane's aftermath
We've both traveled down that road
Where in the name of love anything goes
Like a child in the night
With no one to hold you
And tell you everything's gonna be all right
I must admit it's been fun
But that's no reason to jump the gun
If this is real time will tell
So let me bite my tongue and remind myself
