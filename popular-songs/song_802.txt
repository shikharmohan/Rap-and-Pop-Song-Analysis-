Where did my baby go?
I wonder where she ran off to
I miss my baby so I'm calling
But I can't get through
Please tell that girl if you meet her
That someone's longing to see her
Where did my baby go?
I wish that she would get back soon, get back soon
Searching for the lover I knew
Have you seen her? Where did she go?
Feels like I've just lost my only friend
Flames subsided, colors faded
Love just got so complicated
Wish that I could see her smile again
So if you see her out there
Tell her I'm still here
Waiting for the day
When she will reappear
Where did my baby go?
I wonder where she ran off to
I miss my baby so I'm calling
But I can't get through
Please tell that girl if you meet her
That someone's longing to see her
Where did my baby go?
I wish that she would get back soon, get back soon
Maybe I was wrong
And I ignored her for too long
And I didn't even notice
When she slipped away
Maybe while I lay fast asleep
Then out into the night she creeps
I'll leave the light on
So she'll come back someday
Oh, if you see her out there
Tell her it's not fair
And that life's just not the same
When she's not here
Where did my baby go?
I wonder where she ran off to
I miss my baby so
Just what am I supposed to do?
Please tell that girl if you meet her
That someone's longing to see her
Where did my baby go?
I wish that she would get back soon, get back soon
Get back soon
Get back soon
Where did my baby go?
I wonder where she ran off to
I miss my baby so
Just what am I supposed to do?
Please tell that girl if you meet her
That someone's longing to see her
Where did my baby go?
I wish that she would get back soon, get back soon
Get back soon
Get back soon
Get back soon
