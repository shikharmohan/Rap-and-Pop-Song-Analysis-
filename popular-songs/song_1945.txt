Close the doors
Lay down
No, no, no, not like that
Like this, yeah, I like that
Okay, now here's what I want you to do
I want you to look me right in my eyes
And I want you to tell me exactly
What you want me to do to you, you ready?
Your body whispering from under the sheets
I hear it moaning, begging loud and clearly
I'm rather fluent in the language it speaks
But it's your mouth, I want to tell it to me
Girl, why don't you tell me what you want me to do to you
Say it, say it, say it
Girl, why don't you tell me what you want from me
Girl won't you say it, say it, say it
It's not as if I'm not totally aware
That you want my hands right here and my mouth right there
Girl, don't play shy, show me how bold you can be
Open your mouth and tell me where you want me
Girl, why don't you tell me what you want me to do to you
Say it, say it, say it
Girl, why don't you tell me what you want from me
Girl, won't you say it, say it, say it
Tell me what you want
Oh, you want that?
Say the word
Turn around
Anything that you want baby tell me you want it
I got it babe
No more hoping and wishing, name your position
I got it babe
Anything that you want baby tell me you want it
I got it babe
No more hoping and wishing, name your position
I got it babe
  (Girl, why don't you tell me what you want me to do to you)
Anything that you want baby tell me you want it
I got it babe
No more hoping and wishing, name your position
  (Say it, say it, say it)
I got it babe
  (Girl, why don't you tell me what you want from me)
Anything that you want baby tell me you want it
I got it babe
  (Girl, won't you say it, say it, say it)
No more hoping and wishing, name your position
I got it babe
Ohh yeah
Say it, say it
Tell me how you want baby
Tell me how you want it girl
Tell me how you want it baby
