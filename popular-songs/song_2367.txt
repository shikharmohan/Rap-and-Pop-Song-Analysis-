Shh
Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
All I can say is
Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
Let's go
I don't need nobody else around, see
Love the way you compliment my style
Though you may end up bein' my only girl
'Cause when you're with me you're my whole world
Like when it's just me and you
Vibe is crazy between us two
You're my homie, my lover indeed and my friend
Now I said this before, I'ma say it again
Now here is the situation, I like what we've got happenin'
And I don't want nothin' comin' in between both me and you
I'll let you be lieutenant if you let me be captain
Tell me if that's cool
Baby, I want you to be my entourage
Super fly chick
You could be my personal superstar
Super fly chick
Baby, I want you to be my entourage
If you want then we could take this very far
Super fly chick
You're a star in your own right
At times you steal the whole spotlight
I don't mind, girl, you're fine, put a smile on my face
Besides who want a chick that no dude would chase
Sometimes I know you're unsure
Wonder if this will endure
Don't make me make no promise that I can't keep
'Cause it's cool how it is, let's not complicate things, girl
Here is the situation, I like what we've got happenin'
And I don't want nothin' comin' in between both me and you
I'll let you be lieutenant if you let me be captain
Tell me if that's cool
Baby, I want you to be my entourage
Super fly chick
You could be my personal superstar
Super fly chick
Baby, I want you to be my entourage
If you want then we could take this very far
Super fly chick
You're a star, that you are
Be my girl, share my world
Come on girl, super fly chick
Baby, I want you to be my entourage
Super fly chick
You could be my personal superstar
Super fly chick
Baby, I want you to be my entourage
If you want then we could take this very far
Super fly chick
