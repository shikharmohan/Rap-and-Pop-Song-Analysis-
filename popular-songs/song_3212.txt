And Lord, let him know when the wickness of his enemies try to destroy him,
To bring him down all he has to do is call on you
Now Lord, come bring favor into his life
Favor into his music Lord
Let him know that his best is yet to come
Aslong as he can seize to put you first
[Tech N9ne - Verse 1]
Drama, use to be my middle name
with ecstasy, sex and technically set me for a little fame
it gets to me, when the people I used to know switch and change
regretfully, I'm gonna say I don't wanna see none of 'em again
They stressin' me, when they think 'cause of my absence I'm playin' games
When really I just work in strain to let everybody else feel my pain
and respectfully, I gotta say buzz off you and Tech Nina thangs in jeopardy
'cause I need angels around me they should cling
but you never be strange lane
I feel this deep in my vein
Like Leprosy, you attackin' my nerves and mess with my brain
It's vexin' me, ain't a angel inside you distrustin' vain is your recipe
to complain is necessity, you're to blame so I reckon we,
no longer straight, that's why I never came
When you beckoned me, I need peace in my life
But with you need gangs and weaponary, im too busy to have these lousy lames
To come question me, man I really do need more angels blessing me
[Chorus - Irv Da Phenom]
You see we've all done our dirt
God knows that I have and I know I can't take that back
But I can say today I'm makin a change
Ima leave the drama in my past
So if you try to bring me down
Don't you ever come around
I got no space in my life for negative
I said I need, I need more angels around me
[Tech N9ne - Verse 2]
Need, somebody to bring me a brighter day
Not somebody that when I see them coming gotta hide away
Like these losers leavin messages
Then gon try and say I went Hollywood when i dont answer
So you know I press delete right away
I need the drama gone, like Im at my mama home
yep, persona's piranha, beyond the haters try my home
so if you wanna get on us, you get the lama chrome
I know that you hear me even though im speakin mono tone
thats to the demons who callin leavin' me death threats
been a couple of years of my spirit, aint even left yet
yellin' bout when i come to your town im liable to get wet
tech said maybe angels but doubt you can bet that
we dont need evil seeds making us get dummy
wanna breath the weight of succed get from me
devil breed aint no need for we to get chummy 
deny your creed and procceed to get money
[Chorus - Irv Da Phenom]
You see we've all done our dirt
God knows that I have and I know I can't take that back
But I can say today I'm makin a change
Ima leave the drama in my past
So if you try to bring me down
Don't you ever come around
I got no space in my life for negative
I said I need, I need more angels around me
[Tech N9ne - Verse 3]
need sun rays, not a dark cloud
thats why they still lookin for me like were art thou
ohh brotha, they so cluddered and hearts foul
aint never returned they call and they bout to start now
need angel wings, not gargole, you bring that beef to me 
get ready to get charbroiled i treated them so nice in the past
these people are spoiled reject them demons
and get them all off our soil and when the smoke clears in your retina
who cleaned it up you gosta give it up to shlegna
the black boots and red strings come to bless ya lets ya mesh mess
and threds bash your ex-a, dust yes thats us but my angle
is to break news to these webs thats so tangled such a shame
your name remains painfull so change your games
coz we were stained but became angles
[Chorus - Irv Da Phenom]
You see we've all done our dirt
God knows that I have and I know I can't take that back
But I can say today I'm makin a change
Ima leave the drama in my past
So if you try to bring me down
Don't you ever come around
I got no space in my life for negative
I said I need, I need more angels around me
around me x10
