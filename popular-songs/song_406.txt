Midnight, stop light, happens every time pretty girl in a car
No resemblance what so ever I wonder how you are
Constant question pounding in my brain
Is anybody loving you these days?
Lonesome pillow, sun come yellow I reach across the bed
Should be hurried, workin', worries I lie there instead
With the thought that's driving me insane
Is anybody loving you these days?
Damn this small town, every place that I go
I drive by your house, see his car and I know
He's there with you, but when he kisses you
Think about the memories we made, and tell me
Is anybody loving you these days?
Second chances, backward glances most people just say no
World keeps turning, heart keeps yearnin', I keep holdin' the hope
One day you might answer with my name
Is anybody loving you these days?
Damn the small town, every place that I go
I drive by your house, see his car and I know
He's there with you, but when he kisses you
Think about the memories we made, and tell me
Is anybody loving you? I mean really loving you
Is anybody loving you these days?
