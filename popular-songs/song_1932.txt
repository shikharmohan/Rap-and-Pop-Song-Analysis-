got my bags at the door
i'm getting ready to leave
ohhh ohhh mmmm,,,
i can tell there's something u wanna say to me
ohhh ohhh
baby speak your mind
cuz u're wasting time
it's a quarter to nine
and my car's on the way
you said u wasn't ready for this
so i'm at the door
heard there's something on ur mind changed
chorus:
if u want me to stay
if u want me to stay
say u want me to stay
baby stop playing around with me
there'll be no time to play
if u want me to stay
baby u've got to show me
2nd verse:
oohhh
ur mind and ur mouth are saying 2 different things
ooohhh ohhh mmmm
u need to figure it out ...i'm tired of waiting ohhh oooh
being indecisive.. it comes with a price n' now ur time is almost gone mmm...
i'm hearing " go on and leave "
u dont care about me
but ur eyes r saying u want me home
chorus:
if u want me to stay
if u want me to stay
say u want me to stay
baby stop playing around with me
there'll be no time to play
if u want me to stay
baby u've got to show me

baby stop playing around with me
