It's strange to hear your voice
I did not expect for you to call
You wonder how I'm doing
How I'm holding up since you did me wrong
Well, how am I doing since you did what you've done to me?
I can't lie, I sometimes cry when I think of how it used to be
I keep my friends with me, I stay busy and I don't get much sleep
Baby, that's how I'm doin' since you did what you d-d-done to me
Well, now wait one minute
I failed to mention those tears I cried were tears of joy
Because it was no fun there under your thumb and now that we're done
I'm getting right, every night with every single, every lovin' girl in sight
Well, how am I doing since you did what you've done to me?
I can't lie, I sometimes cry when I think of how it used to be
I keep my friends with me, I stay busy and I don't get much sleep
Baby, that's how I'm doin' since you did what you d-d-done to me, alright
Well, when all my friends heard what a you know what you were
They took me out on the town
But then I heard our song and I danced along but it felt all wrong
'Cause she was sweet, she let me lead
She never took her ever lovin' eyes off me
So, how am I doing since you did what you've done to me?
I can't lie, I sometimes cry when I think of how it used to be
I keep my friends with me, I stay busy and I don't get much sleep
Baby, that's how I'm doing since you did what you d-d-done to me
Well, I don't know what you were thinking, running 'round on me
Now you say your sorry, well honey I agree
So, how are you doing since you did what you've done to me?
Girl don't lie, I know you cried 'cause you know how good it used to be
Yeah tell me does the thought of losing my true love make it hard to sleep?
Baby, how are you doing since you did what you d-d-done to me
Now how are you doing, now that you know how I'm doing
Since you did what you d-d-done to me
