He's tall dark and dangerous
He's a love thief on the run
He's a moonlight bandit
Brother to the devil's son
He'll comfort you with sweet talk
Tell you what you want to hear
Then he'll take your smilin' face
And he'll cover it with tears
Oh, they call him Poison Sugar
'Cause there's poison in his kiss
Oh, you ladies warn your daughters
About the stranger with the poison lips
His hands warm your body
Like the mornin' Georgia sun
You'll think you found forever in his arms
Before he's done
With honey drippin' off his words
Your passion takes him home
His lyin' lips won't tell you
You'll be wakin' up alone
Oh, they call him Poison Sugar
'Cause there's poison in his kiss
Oh, you ladies warn your daughters
About the stranger with the poison lips
You could find him on a dark street
You could meet him at the store
He could even wake you up
Knockin' on your door
Well, I'm talkin' from experience
I'm a victim of his kiss
I'm just one of the many
That he's loved and left like this
They call him Poison Sugar
'Cause there's poison in his kiss
Oh, you ladies warn your daughters
About the stranger with the poison lips
Oh, they call him Poison Sugar
'Cause there's poison in his kiss
Oh, you ladies warn your daughters
About the stranger with the poison lips
Oh, they call him Poison Sugar
'Cause there's poison in his kiss
