We've got a nice little house on a quiet little street
But it don't matter
A two car garage with a new Cherokee
But it don't matter
'Cause we don't ever seem to talk anymore
And you don't hold me like you did before
We've got everything we wanted and more
But now I know and now I see
Nothing matters if you don't love me
We've given twelve precious years of our lives
But it don't matter
And I guess for a while we were both satisfied
But it don't matter
'Cause we don't ever seem to talk anymore
And you don't hold me like you did before
We've got everything we wanted and more
But now I know and now I see
Nothing matters if you don't love me
It wouldn't be easy to walk out tonight
But it don't matter
And I know I would miss you if you said goodbye
But it don't matter
We don't ever seem to talk anymore
You don't hold me like you did before
We've got everything we wanted and more
But now I know and now I see
Nothing matters if you don't love me
Now I know and now I see
Nothing matters if you don't love me
Nothing matters if you don't love me
