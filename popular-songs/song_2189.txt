Ready?
Even if you own a wife
Even if you like in my state
I could never want a bribe
I've been there no matter what that
In the Sunday
With my sound
Even if you wanted light
I could never matter to play
Even if you want a life
Even if I like it you're sad
In the Sunday
In the sound
Even if you own a wife
Even if you wanted on thing
I could never want a life
I could never only one day
