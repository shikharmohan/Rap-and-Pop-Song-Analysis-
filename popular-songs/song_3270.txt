[1st verse]
I was kicking it
With this chick for a minute
She picked me to hit it
Real stiffly I sitted
He spit
Then we quit it
Then I told her
To miss me
And splitted
Quickly I lit it up
No problem to get it up
Then she called and said
She needed me to help her
Get rid of what
A baby
She said she wanted me to kill it
No evidence
Blood
Don't spill it
I'm saying at first
I didn't feel it
But then I started to ponder
On what was coming up
Yonder
A baby by a fling
Made days seem
Really somber
So we both were in agreement
The baby I seen it
Thinking of killing it
Made me almost fall
To the cement
This ain't a job
I can do myself
I ain't got the brain for this
So I called a homie in kansas
Who was trained for this
He said
The way I rap
And make skrill for a living
He said he kills for a living
For the grip span
He's a hit man
So I paid him a fee
He told me
What date it would be
Me and her was down
But I really don't think
The baby was g
So we three road to kansas
Baby probably thinking we scandalous
Can't even walk
And we band his
Life
Man is trife
Walked in
And he told us to relax
I sat
And he took
Her and baby to the back
Before I came
I smoked some dope
To calm me
They came back
And she was baby less
And she was looking like a zombie
Baby gone (baby gone)
Were we wrong (hella wrong)
Gotta move on (gotta move on)
Let it alone (yeah)
I dropped her off
But she didn't hate me
For killing the baby
She said she still
Wanted to date me
Crazy
I'm riding and I'm thinking
Why
I took a life
But I ain't tweeking
I know god
Probably thinking
I should die

[2nd verse]
A couple of years later
I'm creeping with this chicklet
Little thick chick
Hit it raw
And gave her triplets
I need to learn to hold my liquid
So I called my man
In kansas city, kan
I told him i
Needed him to do it again
After he put 'em away
I asked him
Homie how could you
Be so raw
He said to me
How could you be so raw
We scatted
One year later
I splatted
In the same chick
She wanted to have it
But I made her do
The same shit
So I murdered five kids of mine
I'm 'bout to sit in hell a lifetime
Bid for mine
Cause of abortion
No more
Abortion
Now it's blown out of proportion
Insane
Never again
