Let's play a game
Let's just pretend like you don't know who I am
believe it if you say that you're not a fan
act like I'm interested in some other man, man, man
Turn on the lights so that the camera flashing won't be so bright
and like the crowd ain't getting big outside 
They're wanting details of how I live my life, my life, my life
There's no exscape from the fame, to somewhere they don't know my name
I love you I do feel your pain  but The question still remains
Can you love somebody that got everybody, Can you love somebody when they're everybody girl x2
Can you love her, can you love her, can you love the girl,
Can you love her, can you love her, can you love the girl
Can you love her, can you love her, can you love the girl
Can you love her, can you love her, can you love the girl
Out through the back too many people blocking the front door we go our different ways
though we want more, another gig I got don't end til four, four four.
There's no exscape from the fame, to somewhere they don't know my name
I love you I do feel your pain  but The question still remains
Can you love somebody that got everybody, Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl x2
Can you love her, can you love her, can you love the girl,
Can you love her, can you love her, can you love the girl
Can you love her, can you love her, can you love the girl
Can you love her, can you love her, can you love the girl
I love it!I love it, I'm flying and I love it!She just wants to be seen ooohhh
Can you hang on to a shooting star and the distance near and far don't let the jealosy and envy get to you
Cause I'll be running home right back to you!
Can you love somebody that got everybody, Can you love somebody when they're everybody girl x2
Can you love her, can you love her, can you love the girl,
Can you love her, can you love her, can you love the girl
Can you love her, can you love her, can you love the girl
Can you love her, can you love her, can you love the girl
