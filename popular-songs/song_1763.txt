Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, ah-ah, aye, woohoo, woohoo
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, ah-ah, aye, woohoo, woohoo
I'm alone, it's just me
And I'm watchin' TV
And I'm always, oh so bored at home
I get up, I get out
Drive my car way downtown
Keep on calling, but you're never around
See my friends out tonight
Under these city lights
In the club 'til someone starts a fight
And we get in the car
Still don't know where you are
So pissed off, always hangin' around
And I'm so tired, you're fired!
I'm so jealous, restless, relentless
That's just me
I'm so crazy lately
Come on, let it be
Don't make me beg for the things I need
You know what they say
Where there's a will, there's a way
Lies are free, talk is cheap
  (Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, ah-ah, aye, woohoo, woohoo)
Now we're out in the street
And we're sweatin' the heat
And we move with the traffic and the beat
I don't care if you choke
When you light up your smoke
It's the one thing I can't call my own
It's so tragic, I'm so manic!
I'm so jealous, restless, relentless
That's just me
I'm so crazy lately
Come on, let it be
Don't make me beg for the things I need
You know what they say
Where there's a will, there's a way
Lies are free, talk is cheap
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, ah-ah, aye, woohoo, woohoo
I'm so tired, you're fired!
I'm so jealous, restless, relentless
That's just me
I'm so crazy lately
Come on, let it be
Don't make me beg for the things I need
You know what they say
Where there's a will there's a way
Lies are free, talk is cheap
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, ah-ah, aye, woohoo, woohoo
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, ah-ah, aye, woohoo
Talk is cheap
  (Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, ah-ah, aye, woohoo, woohoo)
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, ah-ah, aye, woohoo, woohoo
Ya, lies are free, and talk is cheap
