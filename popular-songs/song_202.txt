I was drivin', cruising on the highway
It was a Friday, midnight, when he called me
I was thinkin', 'Hell no'
I already know what he wants, surprise, surprise
So I changed plans and made some arrangements
I won't be chasing, someone that's in place and
That's when I called my girls up
Who about to hit the club up
Tonight's the night, let's go
You can miss me all you want but I'm not comin' over
(That's right)
Tonight I'm doin' me, I'll call you in the mornin'
(That's right)
Hangin' with my girls until the break of dawn
(That's right)
You can't tell me no 'cuz I can do what I want
  (That's right)
Tonight I'm havin' fun, tonight I'm goin' out
That's right I'm gonna party all night long
I'm turnin' off the phone so we can get it on
Oh, oh, oh
Can't stand the e-mails askin' for details
"When are you leavin'?" "When will you get here?"
Kept callin' my cellphone
I sent him straight to voicemail
'Leave a message'
I usually call back, this time I'ma fall back
I know what the real be, he just wanna see me
'Cuz he wanna tap, to tap, tap, tap, tap, that booty
But he's not gonna get that booty
If you think that it's like that, think again 'cuz it's not that
You can miss me all you want but I'm not comin' over
(That's right)
Tonight I'm doin' me, I'll call you in the mornin'
(That's right)
Hangin' with my girls until the break of dawn
(That's right)
You can't tell me no 'cuz I can do what I want
  (That's right)
Tonight I'm havin' fun, tonight I'm goin' out
That's right I'm gonna party all night long
I'm turnin' off the phone so we can get it on
Oh, oh, oh
I got my hands up on my back, back
Take it to the floor, floor
We gon' rock, all night, that's right
Take it down low, that's right
What's up? I'm hot tonight
What's up? We hit the spot tonight
What's up? That's right
That's right, that's right
Like this, and this, and like that, that, that
John drop the beat and bring it back, back, back
Wassup? Wassup? That's right, that's right
You like it? I like it
You love it? I love it
You want it? You want it?
Wassup? Wassup?
You can miss me all you want but I'm not comin' over
(That's right)
Tonight I'm doin' me, I'll call you in the mornin'
(That's right)
Hangin' with my girls until the break of dawn
(That's right)
You can't tell me no 'cuz I can do what I want
  (That's right)
Tonight I'm havin' fun, tonight I'm goin' out
That's right I'm gonna party all night long
I'm turnin' off the phone so we can get it on
Oh, oh, oh
