Girl I know you want to give it to me
You got something I can't deny
Oh won't you drop it so I can see?
Damn I can tell that you're not shy
Girl I know you want to give it to me
You got something I can't deny
Oh won't you drop it so I can see?
Damn I can tell that you're not shy
She's all over me like a steal grown mammal
Waitin' to bust off, it just won't jam her
She's ready to be throwed out of handle
Stickin' up panicin', if she get sweater
I can tell that she knows everything in the club
Wishin' I can switch places with her
Get my attention like I'm giving to her
Tellin' me to come take off her clothes, got me sayin'
Drop that heater, bop off the meter, get all in her
Shorty's callin' me and I got to go get her
Drop that heater, bop off the meter, get all in her
Shorty's callin' me and I got to go get her
To the girl's room, she's tellin' me to come on
She's ready to drive, she can drop for off
If you play it smooth till the last girl come up
We can slide in and lock the door
She's not ready to go, leaning over the stall
Tellin' me to be so timid with her
She's waited a long time to fill it up
And she don't want to hear the word, no, got me sayin'
Drop that heater, bop off the meter, get all in her
Shorty's callin' me and I got to go get her
Drop that heater, bop off the meter, get all in her
Shorty's callin' me and I got to go get her
There's no way that you're movin'
Got me want to leave up out of here
And take it to a favorite thang
And I got something I need you to feel
And I know that you know exactly what it is
Here it go
Girl I know you want to give it to me
You got something I can't deny
Oh won't you drop it so I can see?
Damn I can tell that you're not shy
Girl I know you want to give it to me
You got something I can't deny
Oh won't you drop it so I can see?
Damn I can tell that you're not shy
Drop that heater, bop off the meter, get all in her
Shorty's callin' me and I got to go get her
Drop that heater, bop off the meter, get all in her
Shorty's callin' me and I got to go get her
Drop that heater, bop off the meter, get all in her
Shorty's callin' me and I got to go get her
Drop that heater, bop off the meter, get all in her
Shorty's callin' me and I got to go get her
Shorty's callin' me and I got to go get her
Shorty's callin' me and I got to go get her
Girl I know you want to give it to me
You got something I can't deny
Oh won't you drop it so I can see?
