Love goes out, out like a light.
Out like a flame and you cant find it anymore.
Just when you think its lost in the rain, it comes back knockin' at your door.
Its the wheel of the world turning around.
Its the wheel of the world turning around.
and around.
God put us here on this carnival ride.
We close our eyes, never knowing where it'll take us next.
Babies are born, and at the same time, someone's taking their last breath.
Its the wheel of the world.
Its the wheel of the world turning around.
In the blink of an eye, it can change your life.
And it never even slows down.
Its the wheel of the world.
I dont know what it is, Im flying high, but Im wondering why Im sinking on this ship going down.
Life keeps on moving anyway.
Its the wheel of the world.
Its the wheel of the world turning around.
Its the wheel of the world.
Its the wheel of the world turning around.
Its the wheel of the world turning around.
and around.
and around.
Its the wheel of the world turning around.
It can open your heart, it can break you apart.
And it never even slows down.
Its the wheel of the world turning around.
Its the wheel of the world turning around.
Its the wheel of the world turning around.
Its the wheel of the world turning around.
and around.
