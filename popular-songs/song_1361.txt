Well I built a million ravin beauties out of your make believe
Hopin' my imagination might run away with me
Thought I'd picture every vision that a man could dream about
Till you walked through those swing doors and stepped down off that cloud
What's an angel like you doin' in my wildest dreams?
A walkin' talkin' lovin' fantasy
Did you come here tonight just to rescue me?
What's an angel like you doin' in my wildest dreams?
Well, I thought I died and went to Heaven when you set down next to me
And I said to myself "this is too good to believe"
You look like you belong in a Sunday school choir
Instead of in this honky-tonk settin' me on fire
What's an angel like you doin' in my wildest dreams?
A walkin' talkin' lovin' fantasy
Darlin' did you come here tonight just to rescue me?
What's an angel like you doin' in my wildest dreams?
Are you just wishful thinkin'?
A figment of my mind
Well, I'll worry about that tomorrow
Right now, it's closin' time
What's an angel like you doin' in my wildest dreams?
A walkin' talkin' lovin' fantasy
Darlin' did you come here tonight just to rescue me?
What's an angel like you doin' in my wildest dreams?
What's an angel like you doin' in my wildest dreams?
