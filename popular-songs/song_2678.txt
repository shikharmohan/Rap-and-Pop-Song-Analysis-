You talked me into movin' in and givin' you my key
You said you'd be a mess now if it hadn't been for me
You said, "I stole your heart away by lookin' in your eyes"
I wonder now how many times you sold that pack of lies?
If this is how you act
When you give your heart away
Well, take it back
(Take it back)
Ahh, take it back
(Take it back)
You told me, I was everything you wanted and more
Then tell me, "What you're doin' now, sneakin' out the back door?"
You're bringin' home flowers, and a bottle of Chablis
You forgot I don't drink wine, I know that bottle's not for me
If this is how you act
When you give your heart away
Well, take it back
(Take it back)
Ahh, take it back
(Take it back)
Oh, you must think I'm blind
And I don't smell your new cologne
You don't think I notice
All the nights I spend alone
Well, I'm not one for sittin' 'round in some ol' pity pool
You think you got a ticket, and I must be some kind of fool
I hate to steal your thunder, but your playin' days are through
At least they are with me 'cause babe, I got no use for you
Tonight layin' on the street
Babe, your bag is packed
So, take it back
(Take it back)
Ahh, take it back
(Take it back)
Oh, now you must think I'm blind
And I don't smell your new cologne
You don't think I notice
All the nights I spend alone
Well, I'm not one for sittin' 'round in some ol' pity pool
You think you got a ticket, and I must be some kind of fool
I hate to steal your thunder, but your playin' days are through
At least they are with me 'cause babe, I got no use for you
Tonight layin' on the street
Babe, your bag is packed
So, take it back
(Take it back)
Ahh, take it back
(Take it back)
(Take it back)
(Take it back)
