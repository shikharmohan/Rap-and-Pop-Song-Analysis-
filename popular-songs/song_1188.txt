Winter's waitin' on your shoulders
It's hangin' around a little too long
And I can see it in your eyes
You're taking on a load that's just too strong
Oh, but let me get down to the heart of the matter
Baby if you want I can make it better now
When the sun is hard to find, when it's rainin' in your eyes
When the shadows block those pretty little blue skies living inside you
When the fallin' of your tears, makes a candle disappear
When you just can't see the light, baby, I'll find a way to shine
I'll find a way to shine
Everybody's got a cross to carry
Everybody's got a story they can tell
You know you're not the only one
Counting on a quarter and wishin' well
Woah, don't you sit there with your heart under lock and key
Give me one chance, baby, I can set you free
When the sun is hard to find, when it's rainin' in your eyes
When the shadows block those pretty little blue skies living inside you
And when the fallin' of your tears, makes a candle disappear
When you just can't see the light, baby, I'll find a way to shine
I'll find a way to shine
Sometimes in this life good luck don't shine like it suppose to do
When there's no one you can trust and they just keep givin' up on you
Baby don't you know that I won't ever let you down
Come on now, ohh, baby
Oh, don't sit there with your heart under lock and key
Just give me one chance and baby I can set you free
When the sun is hard to find, when it's rainin' in your eyes
When the shadows block those pretty little blue skies living inside you
And when the fallin' of your tears, makes a candle disappear
And you just can't see the light, baby, I'll find a way to shine
I'll find a way to shine
I'll find a way to shine
Find a way to shine
You know I'll find a way
Yeah, I'll find a way, find a way
I'll find a way to shine
