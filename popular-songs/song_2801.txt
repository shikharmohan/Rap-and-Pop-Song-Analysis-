Out of the blue
I needed someone to take me
Out of the blue
It seemed I'd always be alone
Till out of the blue came you
Out of the blue
Waiting for a love to take me
Out of the blue
I thought love had passed me by
Till out of the blue came you
Spreading my wings, alone I'd fly
That empty sky of blue
Hoping that I would someday find
That someone just like you
Out of the blue
Someone who's love would take me
Out of the blue
I had almost given up
Till out of the blue came you
I thought love had passed me by
Till out of the blue came you
