I thought I felt you touch my cheek this morning
But I must have been dreamin'
And in the middle of the night without a warning
I thought I heard you breathin'
Me and my so-called independence
I've got this loneliness that's so relentless
I guess you get used to somebody
Kind of like havin' them around
I guess you get used to the way they make you happy
Bring you up when you're feeling down
I never dreamed when I was letting you go
That I would wake up and miss you this much
I guess you get used to somebody
I guess you get used to bein' loved
I kinda miss those ramblin' conversations
Where we talk about nothin'
The way you always made me laugh at my frustrations
Baby that was somethin'
I should have been careful what I wished for
'Cause I've got my freedom and so much more
I guess you get used to somebody
Kind of like havin' them around
I guess you get used to the way they make you happy
Bring you up when you're feeling down
I never dreamed when I was letting you go
That I would wake up and miss you this much
I guess you get used to somebody
I guess you get used to bein' loved
I never dreamed when I was letting you go
That I would wake up and miss you this much
I guess you get used to somebody
I guess you get used to bein' loved
I guess you get used to somebody
I guess you get used to bein' loved
