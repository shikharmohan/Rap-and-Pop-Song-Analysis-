You ain't done nothing wrong but I think we need to talk
You might be the one but before we go too far
I need a little time to figure out my heart
Who could ask for more but I need to know for sure
I haven't been myself from the minute that we met
I ran into your world and kinda walked out on myself
All those dreams I had, I begin to second guess for you
One too many questions until I know the truth
I need room to breathe
A little time to think
To make sure I don't lose me
I need room to breathe
I know, you're not to blame and I swear there's no one new
This has to do with me and not a thing to do with you
So don't try to understand, you don't have a thing to prove to me
If you really love me just give me what I need
Room to breathe
A little time to think
To make sure I don't lose me
I need room to breathe
Please don't take this wrong
And please don't turn away
I just don't want to look back one day and say
I need room to breathe
A little time to think
To make sure I don't lose me
I need room to breathe
Room to breathe
