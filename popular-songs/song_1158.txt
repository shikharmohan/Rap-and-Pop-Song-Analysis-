Outside my window
I swear on my mama's grave
Faded out the street noise
Like a out of focus Polaroid
So I shot the moon
And I cursed the wind
Making me think
That you were here again
Smoke and mirrors
Somebody stole you away
That's the biggest conspiracy
Since, JFK
So we combed the corners
And glass houses
But the right directions
We never found it
Well, I'd trade in all the rest of my days
Just the mere reflection of your face
For one shining moment
With you or somebody like you
With you or somebody just like you
Called inspectors
The cops and the CIA
They drew chalk circles 'round
The place that we used to lay
But nobody testified
Not a single witness
I swore, I was crucified
With no forgiveness
And the sheriff shined his light
Like I was drunk and dangerous
My hands were already tied
So he put away his handcuffs
And in my blind spot
I saw the silhouette
Your crazy legs smoking
A long black cigarette
But I'd trade in all the rest of my days
Your crooked smile, your wicked ways
I'd fill up all this empty space
With you or somebody like you
With you or somebody just like you
Oh, you or somebody like you, oh
Now I should've learned my lesson
Done what I was told
Should've counted all my blessings
Like fingers and toes
And now I'm tripping like a blind man
And searchin' high and low
For you or somebody like you
For you or somebody just like you
For you or somebody like you
For you or somebody just like you, oh, oh
Yeah, whoa, somebody just like you
Oh, somebody just like you, oh
