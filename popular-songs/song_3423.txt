She's my kind of rain
Like love in a drunken sky
She's confetti falling
Down all night
She sits quietly there
Black water in a jar
Says, "Baby why are you
Trembling like you are?"
So I wait and I try
I confess like a child
She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain
She's the sun set shadows
She's like Rembrandt's light
She's the history
That's made at night
She's my lost companion
She's my dreaming tree
Together in this brief
Eternity
Summer days, winter snows
She's all things to behold
She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain
So I wait and I try
I confess all my crimes
She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain
She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain
She's my kind of rain
Ohh, rain on me
She's my kind of rain
