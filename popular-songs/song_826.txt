The 1st time we ever got a chance to be alone we knew
It was wrong to do, I guess that's why I was drawn to you
The 2nd time leads to the 3rd, 5th, the 7th time
I feel so alive, it won't last but it's alright
Fleeting joy and fading ecstasy
Here it goes again, oh
Sneaking fruit from the forbidden tree
Sweet taste of sin
And I'm doing it again
Yes I'm doing it again
Oh I'm doing it again
I said it would end but here it goes again
This time you told me you saw me at the same hotel
You said you knew me well and I had that familiar smell
You asked me how am I ever going to learn to put my trust in you
Like you want me to 'cause I know what you're prone to do
Accusations fly like bullets do
Here it goes again, oh
Oh but you know me because you're doing it too
The cycle never ends, it never ends
Oh you're doing it again
Yes you're doing it again
Oh you're doing it again
You said it would end but here it goes again
And again, and again
Damn, I love you but this is crazy
I have to fight you almost daily
We break up so fast and we
We make up so passionately
Why can't we just trust each other?
You can't hate me and be my lover
Passion ends, the pains begins
I come back and we're doing it again
Yes we're doing it again
Oh we're doing it again
We said it would end but here it goes again
Each time you call me home in a sweet refrain
Saying things will change, you'll take away the pain
Then we flashback to the first time you put your spell on me
You envelope me, you feel good as hell to me
One moment leads to another few
Here it goes again, oh, oh, oh
Leaving you is oh so hard to do
I just can't pretend, I can't pretend
I keep doing it again
Oh I'm doing it again
Yes I'm doing it again
I said it would end, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh I'm doing it again
I said it would end, oh, oh , oh, oh
Oh I'm doing it again
I said it would end but here it goes again
