I'm gonna build a fire in the middle of July
Burn your pictures and go for a drive
Down to the river and watch the ink from your love letters fade
Come back home turn that old mattress over
Pour out the whiskey, try wakin' up sober
Gonna change it all tonight, gonna do whatever it takes
Yeah, 'cause I've lost weight and I've lost hair
And I don't intend to ever go back there
Drinkin' and a thinkin' 'bout a love that just wasn't true
And there's a good chance I'll end up insane
Without enough sense to come in from the rain
My mind might be the last thing you make me lose
But, I'll forget about you
I heard that ol' Jones song just the other day
'Bout a man who took a broken heart to his grave
But, I'll be damned if a memory is gonna lay me down
I might be walkin' around with a head full of air
Actin' kinda crazy but I don't care
This heart's barely beating, but I'll still be above the ground
Yeah, 'cause I've lost weight and I've lost hair
And I don't intend to ever go back there
Drinkin' and a thinkin' 'bout a love that just wasn't true
Yeah, and there's a good chance I'll end up insane
Without enough sense to come in from the rain
My mind might be the last thing you make me lose
But, I'll forget about you
'Cause, I've lost sleep and I've lost years
And there ain't no tellin' how many tears
My mind's gonna be the last thing you make me lose
But, I'll forget about, I'll forget about you
I'll forget about you
