Oh, news said
Oh, yeah
If I had twenty million dollars in a vault somewhere baby
It wouldn't matter anyway
'Cause the doctor told me that I'm dying slowly
So I guess I got to love you while I'm here baby
Did you know?
The news said that sky is falling, globe is warming
My country's warring, leaders are lying, time is running
Nowhere to go baby, nowhere to go
I know we just met
But baby could you love me quickly, quickly?
I want you to love me
Like you know the world is about to end baby quickly
You said you didn't even know my name, but
Told me we mind as well make ours the same
What do you think, baby?
No time
Think it might as well be light years away, oh
We just better land on the stars
Before they come crashing down
'Cause I heard the news say
The news said the sky is falling, the globe is warming
My country's warring, leaders are lying, time is running
Nowhere to go, nowhere to go
I know we just met
But baby could you love me quickly, quickly?
Want you to love me
Like you know the world is about to end baby quickly
Yeah, that's right baby, kiss me like the world is quaking
Do it like the earth is shaking, you got it baby
That's right lovely fill me like our time is sprinting faster
Running out of time
I know we just met
But baby could you love me quickly, quickly?
Want you to love me
Like you know the world is about to end baby quickly
You barely know me baby
But you gotta love me quickly, quickly
Oh yeah, you gotta love me
Like you know the world's about to end baby quickly
Oh, you gotta love me, gotta love me
Oh yeah, like the world's about to end baby
Quickly now, the news said the sky's falling
Quickly now, just love me, love me
