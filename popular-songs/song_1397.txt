I'm not afraid of lonely
I've gotten good at being that
Ain't seen nothing that could hold me
Say goodbye and don't look back
Running, always ready
Feel as strong and steady
But you scare me
Took a long walk after midnight
Trying to make sense of it all
Tried to catch a glimpse of my old life
But your face was all I saw
Blue eyes staring through me
Baby, what are you doing to me?
You scare me
  (Never felt this before
  It's all brand new to me
  Never known anyone)
You scare me
  (I'm doing what I said
  I would never do
  Too late to stop it now)
Knowing there's no turning back
Knowing I don't want to
Baby, you scare me
  (Never felt this before
  It's all brand new to me
  Never known anyone)
You scare me
  (I'm doing what I said
  I would never do
  Too late to stop it now)
Scare me, scare me
Baby, you scare me
Scare me
