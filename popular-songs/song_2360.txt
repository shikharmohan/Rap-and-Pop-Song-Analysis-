Chorus: 
"Puerto Rico" is where she come from 
she asked me do i love her that record song 
by si si si si bunoes bonita. 
you wanna ever be mine stay on hip hop 
but tonight where gonna reggaton the whole club. 
I see you party in the streets, 
see my myself climbing in the 
seats the hood is like heaven now reminiscing 
them days when i thought about throwing on a towel 
the night before the month was like Christmas 
this kid keep hustling me sometimes i felt 
like i couldn't breath i would have to sit back 
and play naive and it hurt watching my mum struggle 
trust me when you broke and hungry its hard 
to stay out of trouble its a survival of the fittest 
whatever it took to bring money to the table 
i did it even my girl lost faith in me 
left me out trapped in this negative energy 
listening deeply but i have to keep on 
moving i refuse to let this darkness, catch up to me 
chorus: 
"Puerto Rico" is where she come from 
she asked me do i love her that record song 
by si si si bunoes bonita. 
you wanna ever be mine stay on hip hop 
but tonight where gonna reggaton the whole club. 
Dowled up but it was just a distraction 
even the streets never gave us a little time to relax 
writting my rhymes to a vibe scap in the corner 
wrapped me like a cake im trying to be this super man 
in the ghetto get this paper take this music 
to a whole new level trouble found me now 
i found myself in puerto rico spy got hot 
i had to roll living with my paps 
i really don't no missing my lady try not to tell it show 
her new man telling her i would probably never blow 
wanted to tell to the flow i know robbin it stay in the zone 
and move hard or go home open my eyes now 
i see myself on the rock miens bonitas 
everywhere i wanna ride 
chorus: 
"Puerto Rico" is where she come from 
she asked me do i love her that record song 
by si si si bunoes bonita. 
you wanna ever be mine stay on hip hop 
but tonight where gonna reggaton the whole club. 
All you gotta do is listen 
banno yellow telia mama(yeah,yeah,yeah) 
seie tiel mama bata 
bitu weil teia sicla 
como elese wella 
si pak pak wella 
I never thought i would see the day 
that i will be getting money 
making music so these hatters can't take nothing off me 
when the chicks wouldn't holla i just play them back 
all i had was a flow and a ball cap, 
wall to wall boom boom across the room 
thinking to myself they'll be dancing to me soon
im in the game but I'm selling the streets though rapped 
so hard that Puerto Rico Puerto Rico .. 
chorus: 
"Puerto Rico" is where she come from 
she asked me do i love her that record song 
by si si si bunoes bonita. 
you wanna ever be mine stay on hip hop 
but tonight where gonna reggaton the whole club. 
All you gotta do is listen.. 
she looks fine just whistle at her 
see the cops coming then just miss at her 
if i cant spend my weekend in a cell country
