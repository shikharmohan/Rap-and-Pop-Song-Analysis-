This situation
If it gets any deeper
Could be critical
I'm not your love monkey
So be taking back
All the lies you sold
What did you want me to be? Yeah
It's just too much now
So tell me
So tell me
So tell me
One two three four!
So what's your evil attitude
When you got me spending my time pleasing you
Why must you keep me underground
Tell me, tell me, why you wanna bring me down?
Is it too much to give a damn
When I'm giving you one hundred and ten
Don't blink cause I won't be around
Tell me, so tell me, why you wanna bring me down?
Now your transmission is on the negative
You're on a losing streak
This information is getting ordinary
And you're losing me
What's with your hostility
Oh, when the lie's on me
Well you're down to the last chance
So tell me
So tell me
So tell me
Uno dos tres cuatro!
So what's your evil attitude

(Down, oh yeah, bring me down, ooh yeah, oh)
Was it all just a waste of time?
Well I don't wanna spend my whole life thinkin' 'bout it
Baby, this is where I draw the line
