Rain fallin', fallin' rain
It's a long and troubled night
A night when I wish I could sleep
But there's no sleep inside
Heart breaking, breaking heart
It's such a lonely sound
That cries for the need of someone
But there's no one around
Nobody here to hold
No one to warm the cold
That lies deep within
My soul all around
Just the sound of the rain falling, fallin' rain
Like gentle tears of pain
That comes with my only friend
It's the gently falling rain
Nobody here to hold
No one to warm the cold
That lies deep within
My soul all around
Just the sound of the rain falling, fallin' rain
Like gentle tears of pain
That comes with my only friend
It's the gently falling rain
