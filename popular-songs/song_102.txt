Merrymaking, drug taking
At my place baby, at my place
Merrymaking
Come in to my house
You're invited into my house
Entering the back of my house
Welcoming you into my house
Come in to my house
You're invited into my house
Entering the back of my house
Welcoming you into my house
I've invited loads to my house
Loads of people come to my house
They take stuff inside of my house
And smoke stuff outside of my house
Merrymaking, drug taking
At my place baby, at my place
Merrymaking
I've seen them before
Lots of people at my front door
Lots of people in my front door
Trying to get into my house
I've seen them before
Lots of people in my front door
Lots of people at my front door
Trying to get into my house
Merrymaking, drug taking
At my place baby, at my place
Merrymaking, drug taking
At my place baby, at my place
Merrymaking
We're merrymaking
All the stuff that you've been taking
All the stuff that I've been taking
All the stuff that we've been taking
We're merrymaking
All the stuff that we've been taking
All the stuff that I've been taking
All the stuff that you've been taking
Merrymaking, drug taking
