Everytime I hear the lonesome whistle whine
From a lonesome locomotive, comin' down the line
It carries me back to another place in time
When train travelin' across the land was the only way to fly
Am I a fool to think it glamorous
Box carring like a hobo, it must have been rough
But a simple way of life is what it really means to me
When we weren't so dependent on money to be free
I hear you train, are you travelin' my way?
Won't you let me ride your rails right back to yesterday?
Who knows what I could see from that old time machine?
But there you go again train travelin'
There you go again train travelin'
I'm lyin' on a rotten wooden floor
Smell yesterday's whiskey, here rattlin' at the door
A railroad man lookin' for me, I'm scared as I can be
I open my eyes and realize, it's just another dream
I hear you train, are you travelin' my way?
Won't you let me ride your rails right back to yesterday?
Who knows, what I could see from that old time machine?
But, there you go again train travelin'
Yea, there you go again train travelin'
I hear you train, are you travelin' my way?
Won't you let me ride your rails right back to yesterday?
Who knows, what I could see from that ol' time machine?
Oh, but there you go again train travelin'
Yea, there you go again train travelin'
There you go again train travelin'
