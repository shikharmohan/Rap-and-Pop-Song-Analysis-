No, I don't want no Jack and Coke
Please, sit me where there ain't no smoke
Don't want nothing clouding up my eyes
Well, you see that girl over there
Dancing like she's on thin air
There's got to be a secret to her smile
Well, I think that I just found it
And he's twirling her around
I'd like to place my order
You might wanna write this down
I'll have what she's having
I want what she's got
Someone sweet as he can be
And by the way that hot
A tall order I suppose
Well, if you can find me one of those
I'll have what she's having
Well, I like the way he looks at her
It's plain to see he knows the words
That makes her shine from forty feet away
If there's any justice in this world
He's got a twin who wants a girl
Who looks like me, excuse me while I pray
So if you could slip my number
In that pocket on his hip
It would be appreciated
And reflected in your tip
I'll have what she's having
I want what she's got
Someone sweet as he can be
And by the way that hot
A tall order I suppose
Well, if you can find me one of those
I'll have what she's having
A tall order I suppose
Well, if you can find me one of those
I'll have what she's having
Well, I know it's wrong to covet
But why should she have all of it?
I'll have what she's having
Oh, I'll have what she's having
