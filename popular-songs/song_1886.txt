Ruke Ferizaj baby
 
mmmm yeahh ohhh
Chorus:
All I want is to be wanted by you
May this love never end
Cuz IÃÂ¢€m speechless every time u are around
I get the feeling that I canÃÂ¢€t survive when u are not in my mind
Verse 1:
U can figure it out
Yes u can
Cuz every time I walk through the door
U know that I want to come back just 2 stay a minute more 
When I talk on the phone with a homie
I keep smiling
But u know that IÃÂ¢€m smiling at you
When I feel lonely 
U know that u are the one 2 hold me
When my heart is broken
U always know how to mend it
Chorus:
All I want is to be wanted by u
May this love never end
Cuz IÃÂ¢€m speechless every time u are around
I get the feeling that I canÃÂ¢€t survive when u are not in my mind
Verse 2:
ItÃÂ¢€s funny cuz there can be lies everyday
 But u choose not 2 go that way
And for that I thank you everyday
And I appreciate it more than words can say
Baby I know u get mad quite a few times
And u know that I know why 
And there I come in and dry your eyes  
And kiss u with a smile
We make up again
And u donÃÂ¢€t go mad to bed
 And neither do I 
And it just feels like we are floating in the sky 
Bridge:
And there is the whole world out there
But there is just one taking my breath away
My baby u 
All I ever wanted was founding someone like u 
And yes u
And all I ever want is 2 be wanted by u
Chorus:
May this love never end
Cuz IÃÂ¢€m speechless every time u are around
I get the feeling that I canÃÂ¢€t survive when u are not in my mind
Wanted by u 
Uhh uhh
Wanted by u 
Uu uuu 
Uhh
