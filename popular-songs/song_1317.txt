Roll over baby the time has come
To make a little bit more room
I've hung around you, it's getting tough
I think I'm gonna break down soon
Well, I remember
Crying in the park
It was getting dark
Suddenly I looked up
You were my sky
So go on and sleep darlin'
Why don't you pretend we were just a dream?
It's cool baby it doesn't matter anyway
Well, I'm so sorry got to the station a little too late
Such a shame we just missed the train
Just missed the train
Be quiet angel don't make a sound
Save it for a rainy day
Oh can't you see me?
I'm such a mess
Trying hard to find my way
Do you remember
Wastin' all the time?
We were feeling fine
Though we couldn't walk the line
We were alright
So go on and sleep darlin'
Why don't you pretend we were just a dream?
It's cool baby it doesn't matter anyway
Well, I'm so sorry we got to the station a little late
Such a shame we just missed the train
Oh why did that train just pass us by?
Didn't anyone see we were stuck at the light?
Or we would've made it on time, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
So sleep darlin'
Why don't you pretend we were just a dream?
It's cool baby it doesn't matter anyway
Well, I'm so sorry got to the station a little too late
So sleep darlin'
Why don't you pretend we were just a dream?
It's cool baby it doesn't matter anyway
Well, I'm so sorry got to the station a little too late
Such a shame we just missed the train
