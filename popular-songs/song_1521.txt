It was early one mornin', Playa del Carmen
That's when I first met Jose
He had a 12 foot Schooner, a 3 foot cooler
Full of the catch of the day
And he was wrinkled from grinnin'
From all of the sun he had been in
He was barefoot, cerveza in hand
He said gracias senor when I paid him too much for
All of the Snapper he had
Now I told him my friend it ain't nothin'
In the best broken Spanish I knew
I said I make a good livin' back home where I'm from
He smiled and said amigo me too
He said I fish and I play my guitar
I laugh at the bar with my friends
I go home to my wife, I pray every night
I can do it all over again
Somewhere over Texas I thought of my Lexus
And all the stuff I work so hard for
And all the things that I've gathered from climbing that ladder
Didn't make much sense anymore
They say my nest egg ain't ready to hatch yet
They keep holding my feet to the fire
They call it paying the price so that one day in life
I'll have what I need to retire
And just fish and play my guitar
And laugh at the bar with my friends
Go home to my wife and pray every night
I can do it all over again
And to think that I thought for a while there that I had it made
When the truth is I'm really just dying to live like Jose
And just fish, play my guitar
And laugh at the bar with my friends
Go home to my wife and pray every night
I can do it all over again
Wouldn't that be the life?
Wouldn't that be the life?
