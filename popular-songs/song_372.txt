Well it's been a year and there so much to tell
Been doing alright in spite of myself
Just wish I could stop feeling bad when I pray
But I know I'm gonna get there someday
Got that job I was dreaming about
Sometimes it's tough traveling around
But who I wanna be still seems so far away
But I know I'm gonna get there someday
Glad I told you all I meant to
While I had the chance
'Cause every moment I had with you
Made me who I am
By the way, I met someone new
And wouldn't you know, she's a whole lot like you
Still I ain't ready to settle down in one place
But I know I'm gonna get there someday
Well I guess I'll be movin' on
I'll just leave these daisies by your stone
And Momma, I still miss you every day
But I know I'm gonna get there someday
When that'll be, guess only God can say
But I know I'm gonna get there someday
