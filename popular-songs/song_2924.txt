Nobody told me
It could ever hurt so bad
I'm havin' to learn the hard way
Now that you're gone
It's hurtin' me more
Than any pain I've ever had
And I don't know how I can go on
Nobody dies from a broken heart
Give it time, and your dreams will start again
I know love can tear you apart
But nobody dies from a broken heart
Everyone tells me
It's gonna take a little time
Before you find your heartaches
Slippin' away
I know they mean well
And they're just tryin' to ease my mind
But it doesn't help to hear them say
Nobody dies from a broken heart
  (Oh I wanna believe)
Give it time, and your dreams will start again
I know love can tear you apart
But nobody dies from a broken heart
There's nothin' anybody's gonna say
That'll talk me out of feelin' this way
There's nothin' anybody else can do
To take away my love for you
I know they mean well
And they're just tryin' to ease my mind
It doesn't help to hear them say
Nobody dies from a broken heart
  (Oh I wanna believe)
Give it time, and your dreams will start again
(Give it time)
I know love can tear you apart
But nobody dies from a broken heart
Nobody dies from a broken heart
  (Ahh)
Give it time, and your dreams will start again
  (Dreams)
Oh I know love can tear you apart
  (Ahh)
But nobody dies
  (Nobody dies)
Nobody dies from a broken heart
  (Ahh)
Give it time, and your dreams will start again
  (Hmm)
I know love can tear you apart
