"Excuse me for this, I just want a kiss 
I just wanna know what it feels like to touch 
Something so pure, something I'm so sure of 
What it feels like to stand outside your door. 
I'm unworthy, I can see you're above me, 
but I can be lovely, if given the chance. 
Don't move, I wanna remember you just like this, 
Don't move, it's only a breath or two between our lips.
I know why you left, I can't blame you myself, 
Must be hard living with ghosts in such an empty shell. 
I tried to warn you, been a mess since you've known me, 
I can't promise forever, but I'm working on it. 
If I can't hold you, can I give you a kiss? 
Can I have a kiss?
I see that you're torn, I've got some scars of my own,
Seems I want what I know is gonna leave me hungry
Don't move, I need to remember you just like this.
I know why you left, I can't blame you myself, 
Must be hard living with ghosts in such an empty shell. 
I tried to warn you, been a mess since you've known me, 
I can't promise forever, but I'm working on it. 
If I can't hold you, can I give you a kiss? 
Can I?
All I have, all I can 
Give to you I will, just promise this
If I can't have forever,
Can I have a kiss?
I know why you left, I can't blame you myself, 
Must be hard living with ghosts in such an empty shell. 
I tried to warn you, been a mess since you've known me, 
I can't promise forever, but I'm working on it. 
If I can't hold you, can I give you a kiss?
Can I give you a kiss?
Can I, can I
Can I have a kiss?"
