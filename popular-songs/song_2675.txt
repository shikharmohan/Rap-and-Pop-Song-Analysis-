On a cool gray morning I watched with my own eyes
As he headed out the driveway and finally out of my life
Oh, I knew he'd soon be miles from my mind
So why should tears start fallin' after all this time?
How can a memory last this long?
Will he ever go away?
Even the stars burn out and fall
Will he ever go away?
How can someone who left so long ago
Still be here with me today?
Will he ever go away?
Shouldn't I start living my life for myself?
Shouldn't it be easy to fall in love with someone else?
Oh, why should it be his touch I feel in the dark?
And will his voice always echo through my heart?
How can a memory last this long?
Will he ever go away?
Even the stars burn out and fall
Will he ever go away?
How can someone who left so long ago
Still be here with me today?
Will he ever go away?
Ooh, will he ever go away?
Will he ever go away?
