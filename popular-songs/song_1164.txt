She believes in me like I've been tryin' to do
I'm seein' things I've never seen before
Ever since you came into my life
I've been a better man
Run, run, running, I was running scared
Always lookin' for a place to leave
And I couldn't seem to find where I belonged
'Til she took my hand
We can make this work out baby, I know it's true
Can't picture myself with no one but you
And I think I got it right this time
Oh, yeah
All of my life I've been lookin' for someone
Who believes in love the way I do
And I know I've make my share of big mistakes
But girl I promise you
That we can make this work out baby, I know it's true
Can't picture myself with no one but you
And I think I got it right this time
True believers always find each other
And here we are
Always knew that you were out there just waitin' on me
For me to find my way, find my way to your heart, oh, yeah
We can make this work out baby, I know it's true
Can't picture myself with no one but you
And I think I got it right this time
Yeah, after all the crazy days I made it through
I can't picture myself with no one but you
And I think I got it right this time
Oh, yeah
