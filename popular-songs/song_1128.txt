Monday morning another workin' week ahead
Friday seems so far ahead
The clock keeps ringin', gotta get up out of bed
Maybe this could be the day
Motivation, well it keeps you holon' on
Every step of the way headin' in the right direction
When you think you're turnin' wrong lookin' out for when you stay
So hear what I say there's no other way, you gotta
Hold onto your dreams 'cause someday baby
Your ship is gonna come in so
Hold onto your dreams 'cause everything you see
Comes true if you believe in holding on to your dreams
Well I know sometimes it's hard to see the light
Shinin' at the tunnel's end
And thought the road just goes on and on for miles
So now and then remember
Hold onto your dreams 'cause someday baby
Your ship is gonna come in so
Hold onto your dreams 'cause everything you see
Comes true if you believe in holding on to your dreams
Just like your eyes are the window to the soul
Dreams are the highways that lead to your goal
Hold on, hold on, You've got to hold on, hold on
Hold onto your dreams 'cause someday baby
Your ship is gonna come in so
Hold onto your dreams 'cause everything you see
Comes true if you believe in holding on to your dreams
