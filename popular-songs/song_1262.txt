It's over, it's over, it's over
It seems you can't hear me
When I open my mouth you never listen
You say stay but what does that mean?
Do you think I honestly wanna be reminded forever?
Don't waste your time trying to fix
What I wanna erase, what I need to forget
Don't waste your time on me, my friend
Friend, what does that even mean?
I don't want your hand
You'll only pull me down
So save your breath
Don't waste your song on me, on me
Don't waste your time, it's over
It's not easy not answering
Every time I want to talk to you but I can't
If you only knew the hell that I put myself through
Replaying memories in my head of you and I every night
Don't waste your time trying to fix
What I wanna erase, what I need to forget
Don't waste your time on me my friend
Friend, what does that even mean
I don't want your hand
You'll only pull me down
So save your breath
Don't waste your song on me, on me
Don't waste your time
You're calling, you're talking
You're trying, trying to get in
But it's over, it's over, it's over, friend
Don't waste your time trying to fix it
So save your breath
Don't waste your song on me, on me
Don't waste your time
You held me, you felt me
You left me
But it's over, it's over, it's over
You touched me, you had me
But it's over, it's over, it's over, my friend
Don't waste my time
