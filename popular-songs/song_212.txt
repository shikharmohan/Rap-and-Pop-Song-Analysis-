[Verse:]
Hit the showcase slow
Cop and slam that doe'
Gotta spark those seats
Matching paint and 24's
Hit the shocks
Run the wires from the dash thru the floor
Don't let ya box get hot or ya amps get low
[Pre-Chorus:]
Sitting clean with 2 15's in the back
You hit the switch; you got them girls looking back
[Chorus:]
We like them thugs' with the rattling trunk
Sitting low drop wheels
808 hitting bump thump
Boy we tryna get at ya, if you whipping a rattla
We tryna get at ya, if you whipping a rattla
We like that knock you can hear up the block
With that rattle in your trunk
808 hitting bump thump
Boy I'm tryna get at ya, if you whipping a rattla
We tryna get at ya, if you whipping a rattla
Rattle in ya trunk (hey)
Rattle in ya trunk (hey)
Rattle in ya
Rattle in ya
Rattle in ya trunk (hey)
Rattle in ya trunk (hey)
Rattle in ya trunk (hey)
Rattle in ya
Rattle in ya
Rattle in ya trunk (hey)
[Verse:]
I know ya eyes got deep
When you recline that seat
Got your red top back
And your blue light underneath
[? ] parking valet
You can keep it on the low
Cause the Dools and the drools and the whole world knows
[Pre-Chorus:]
You sitting clean with 2 15's in the back
You hit the switch; you got them girls looking back
[Chorus:]
We like them thugs' with the rattling trunk
Sitting low drop wheels
808 hitting bump thump
We tryna get at ya, if you whipping a rattla
We tryna get at ya, if you whipping a rattla
We like that knock you can hear up the block
With that rattle in your trunk
808 hitting bump thump
We tryna get at ya, if you whipping a rattla
We tryna get at ya, if you whipping a rattla
Rattle in ya trunk (hey)
Rattle in ya trunk (hey)
Rattle in ya
Rattle in ya
Rattle in ya trunk (hey)
Rattle in ya trunk (hey)
Rattle in ya trunk (hey)
Rattle in ya
Rattle in ya
Rattle in ya trunk (hey)
[Rap:]
Bet you want a hardcore rapper to spit it
Cause normally an R&B; chick wouldn't spit this
I like it when the tweeters tweet they bump, bump
The trunks they thump, thump
It makes me bump, bump
(Ci-Ci say something 2 em)
He keeps it clean
When he leans
And it sitting so right
I'm looking mean in the Range
Sitting low [? ]
On, and on, and on
Turning up and make it
Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump
[Chorus:]
We like them thugs' with the rattling trunk
Sitting low drop wheels
808 hitting bump thump
We tryna get at ya, if you whipping a rattla
We tryna get at ya, if you whipping a rattla
We like that knock you can hear up the block
With that rattle in your trunk
808 hitting bump thump
We tryna get at ya, if you whipping a rattla
We tryna get at ya, if you whipping a rattla
Rattle in ya trunk (hey)
Rattle in ya trunk (hey)
Rattle in ya
Rattle in ya
Rattle in ya trunk (hey)
Rattle in ya trunk (hey)
Rattle in ya trunk (hey)
Rattle in ya
Rattle in ya
Rattle in ya trunk (hey)
