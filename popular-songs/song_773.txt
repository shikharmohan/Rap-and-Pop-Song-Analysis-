Lookin' out my window I can't help but think of you
Since you been gone away I've been left feelin' gloom
No one can take this pain away
My hours seem to turn a days as if I'm out of time
There's no more to lose, no more to gain
It seems the clouds can't take the rain 'cause it keeps pourin' down
But to see my sunshine again
To see my sunshine again
To see my sunshine again
To see my sunshine again, again
Lookin' out my window I can't help but reminisce the times we shared
Just memories of you and me
I look up and the sky is cold
How could someone just take your soul so fast and now you're gone
See I quit my job, I can't stop smokin'
Please believe my heart is broken down, I'm all alone
But to see my sunshine again
To see my sunshine again
To see my sunshine again
To see my sunshine again, again
I'm tired of the dark, in need of the light
I wake up each mornin' waitin' for the new rise
I'm scared of outside 'cause it might wash me away
Wish I could open this curtain and know I'll see you again
I'll see you again
If I could hold you again, if I could feel you again
If I could touch you again, again
To see my sunshine again, just to see my sunshine again
To see my sunshine again, just to see my sunshine again
To see my sunshine again, just to see my sunshine again
To see my sunshine again
