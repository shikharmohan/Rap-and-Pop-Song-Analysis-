Ooo say the word
And I'll be yours
Say the word
So I'll be sure
That what I'm feeling goes for both of us
I hate to hear you tell me what you feel is really love
Say the word
Open up
Say the word
What's the hold up
Before I go and give my heart away
I need to know I'm falling for a man who ain't afraid to
Chorus:
Say the word
It's just four little letters
And if you really mean it
You've got me forever
And I've got so much love for you
That all you gotta do
Is say the word
And I'll be there
Anytime, anywhere
Repeat chorus
And I'll be yours
So I'll be sure
Say the word
And I'll be there
Anytime, anywhere
