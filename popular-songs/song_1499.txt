Presented by Walmart: A song to promote literacy
Also featuring Sara Evans, Martina McBride, Kenny Chesney, and Brooks and
Dunn
Phil:   A little boy eight years old
In a semi-circle, eyes aglow
Our teacher told us stories every day
Kenny:  Huck Finn on the Mississippi
Fire breathin' dragons 
With my friends with me
From our homeroom to the Milky Way
We were lost among the pages
And in the voice of Mrs.Davis, she said
Words are your wheels 
To take you anywhere you feel
Phil:   Where you can laugh or you can cry
And let your imagination fly
Let it lead you where it will
Sara:   Your mind is an automobile
And words are your wheels
Phil    There's an old man with all he's done
In his 98 laps around the sun
Somehow he never learned to read or write
B&D;:    And there's a kind soul who's had the pleasure
Of helping him tie the words together
It's never too late to change a life
Now there's a smile on his face
And there's a young heart standing in his place
Words are your wheels 
To take you anywhere you feel
Where you can laugh or you can cry
Let your imagination fly
Let it lead you where it will
Your mind is an automobile
And words are your wheels
Martina:Don't need a rocketship, no red balloon to take a trip
The pages on your fingertips alone
Will take you where you want to go
Phil:   Words are you wheels
Words are your wheels 
To take you anywhere you feel
Where you can laugh and you can cry
Let your imagination fly
Let it take you where it will
Sara:   Your mind is an automobile
And words are your wheels
Phil:   Words are you wheels
Sara:   Words are you wheels
Phil:   Words are your wheels
Sara:   Oh,words are your wheels
