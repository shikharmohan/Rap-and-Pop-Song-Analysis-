Some folks livin' in the country can't  wait to get in their pickup trucks and go to town
There's people livin' in a penthouse dying to get out in the sticks and ride around
There's a man up on a mountain top who wants to go down and breathe the salt air by the shore
There's a guy on an island he ain't smilin' and don't want to be on an island anymore
There's a lady locked in a love affair wouldn't care if she was single again
There's a lonely soul who's only goal is to get that golden ring upon their hand
In the middle of nowhere there's a nobody tryin' to get that 15 minutes of fame
Someplace there's a superstar thinkin' Lord if I could only change my name
Round and round and round and round we go
Why we can't be satisfied I don't know
I don't know....
There's a young man wishin" he could grab the hands of a time and speed em' up a year or two
There's and old man wishin' he could just go back and stop the clock and hang on to his youth
There's a stoner  on the sidewalk wishin' he could just get straight for a day
There's a man in a suit and tie thinkin' gettin' high might be a better way
Round and round and round and round we go
Why we can't be satisfied I don't know
From the day we're born it seems like it never stops
Why do we always want somethin' we ain't got
Aww we ain't got...
(instrumental)
Round and round and round and round we go
Why we can't be satisfied I don't know
Till the day we got seems like it never stops
Why we always wantin' somethin' we ain't got
Oh we ain't got...
Round and round and round and round we go
Round and round and round and round we go
Round and round and round and round we go
Round and round and round and round we go
