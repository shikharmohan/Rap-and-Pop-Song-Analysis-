Dont you pity me no mo just pray for me
That this'll be the last sad song I have to sing
And only time will tell if you stand here with me
And this'll be the last sad song I have to sing
[Tech - Verse 1]
Hey 
Y'all know my mothers sickness
Y'all know I'm breakin down
Y'all know when my circle the devils steady makin rounds
Y'all know I'm missin my children cuz I'm shakin townz
And y'all love my music and how sad I could make it sound
I'm in the darkness so low I'm under the carpet
Whomever wants me to park it you motherfuckers are heartless
They wont be stuck with hardships want a unhappy artist
But Imma break apart from this kod shit regardless
Of whos mad 
Alotta my shit is too sad
Like the death of micheal jackson
Motherfucker whos bad
To jump right out of myself
This shits a fight on my health
The darkness is sellin but I really wana put y'all some light on the shelf
Will you still be
Able to feel me
Even if I'm not talkin about tryin 2 kill me
The king of darkness can no longer conceal me
This could be my last sad song hopin it will be

Yeah
I want some caribou lou
I wana see areolas chicks on my sholders instead of boo hoo
Like I said I'm too through with spreadin 
All I wana hear is my peoples say tech go head and do you
Y'all love my pain and I was glad to give it 
But most of the people who love it never really had to live it
Now they mad and live it 
I dont want no sad to visit 
My music thinkin I'm about to lose it so they bash and diss it
Before they even hear what I have comin this year
Imma be that lit spear lets get some of this shit clear
I aint switchin 2 mainstream only what is happenin is 
You watchin the mainstream go me
So watch me bloom out of this blackened cocoon
Cuz if I go back into gloom I'm just askin for doom
Man I'm just rappin to whom to keep attacking my tombs
I dont wana be melacholy til I put my ass in a tomb

[Tech - Verse 3]
Listen 
Only time can dictate if ill get straight
But I'm reachin for the light as of this day
I love kod but I think I made a mistake
By lettin negative energy in me now I'm misplaced
I lost something along the way
My mama taught me bad things are wrong to say
Still I conjured up a album of songs to play
For the dark and alot of my loved ones are gone today, damn
I'm in a crossroad
I'm tryin 2 go into the light like carol ann there I stand still a lost soul
On the subject on when I talk low
I'm ready to dangle this darkness at the top of the catacoumbs and toss those
But will you still be with me 
Or just kill me quickly
Away with the darkness but I promise the flow will still be sickly
I am the king and I always have the throne
But I hope and prey for tha brighter day
Hope this my last sad song
