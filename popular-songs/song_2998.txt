I always knew this day would come
The world is just too small
To keep out paths from crossin'
Here we are just look at us
I always wondered what I'd say
Would I tell you that life is great
And gettin' better all the time?
Really lookin' up
Would I be too proud to show my heart?
Well, to tell the truth it's not that hard
I'm still not over you
And still the only thing I wanna do
Is open up my arms and reach for you
And to hear you say, you want me too
You're the one for me
And time doesn't seem to disagree
Baby, I'm still not over you, gettin' over me
I guess, I'll never be over you
So there it is, I've said it now
God, I wish someway somehow
You'd look at me with those big blue eyes
And say you missed me too
But you moved on, I understand
Yeah, I tried that too but here I am
I'm still not over you
And still the only thing I wanna do
Is open up my arms and reach for you
And hear you say, you want me, too
You're the one for me
And time doesn't seem to disagree
Baby, I'm still not over you, gettin' over me
I guess, I'll never be
Strong enough to finally set you free
I know love will never let me be over you
I'm still not over you
