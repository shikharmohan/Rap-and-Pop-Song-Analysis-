Preacher man talking about the end of time
Well, Lord knows I'm ready, it don't worry my mind
You see, I ain't afraid of nothing because I believe
I've got a sky full of Angels watching over me
You can take my possessions
You can take all my gold
Nobody but Jesus gonna take my soul
Walk through darkness, I don't need no light
My faith in Jesus gonna be my guide
You see, I ain't afraid of nothing because I believe
I've got a sky full of of Angels watching over me
You can take me for granted
You can take all my gold
Nobody but Jesus gonna take my soul
River's rising but I got no doubt
My sweet savior's gonna pull me out
You see, I ain't afraid of nothing because I believe
I've got a sky full of Angels watching over me
You can take my possessions
You can take all my gold
Nobody but Jesus gonna take my soul
I ain't afraid of nothing because I believe
I've got a sky full of Angels watching over me
I ain't afraid of nothing because I believe
I've got a sky full of Angels watching over me
