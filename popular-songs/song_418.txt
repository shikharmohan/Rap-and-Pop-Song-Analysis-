turn the lights on 
every night i rush to my bed 
with hopes that maybe i'll get a chance to see you 
when i close my eyes i'm going out of my head 
lost in a fairytale  can you hold my hands and be my guide 
clouds filled with stars cover the skies 
and i hope it rains you're the perfect lullaby 
what kinda of dream is this 
you could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare 
either way i dont want to wake up from you 
(turn the lights on)
sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare 
somebody pinch me your love's to good to be true 
(turn the lights on) 
my guilty pleasure i ain't going no where
baby long as you're here i'll be floating on air 
cause your my 
you could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare 
either way i dont want to wake up from you 
(turn the lights on)
i mention you when i say my prayers 
i wrap you around all of my thoughts 
boy you're my temporary high 
i wish that when i wake up you're there 
to wrap you're arms around me for real 
and tell me you'll stay by my side 
clouds filled with stars cover the skies 
and i hope it rains you're the perfect lullaby 
what kinda of dream is this 
you could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare 
either way i dont want to wake up from you 
(turn the lights on)
sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare 
somebody pinch me your love's to good to be true 
(turn the lights on) 
my guilty pleasure i ain't going no where
baby long as you're here i'll be floating on air 
cause your my 
you could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare 
either way i dont want to wake up from you 
(turn the lights on)
tattoo you're name across my heart so it will remain 
not even death can make us part 
what kind of dream is this 
you could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare 
either way i dont want to wake up from you 
(turn the lights on)
sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare 
somebody pinch me your love's to good to be true 
(turn the lights on)
