Used to come around here everyday
Now you're breaking
Used to be the one that is not ashamed
Now you shaming
Lost in all the wars we fought
Never saw a road
Now that I think about you in the skies
I'd turn my row
And I wonder where you are
Now I wonder where you are
Take yourself down, pick yourself up
Everything changed when you got along
7 point 1 took it all down
Suddenly you can't even be found
I said, "All night long"
A missing person's in the window
Staring at me, saying things I can't hear
A missing person's in the window
Staring at me, haven't seen them in years
First things first, second in command
Right as I'm trying to change my plan
Second gonna die, oh, he can't breathe
Everybody's staring straight at me
You spend it all chasing those lies
I don't really wanna take that chance
I don't really wanna do that dance
I don't know what to do till you say
Oh, I don't wanna let you go
But I can't keep holding on
Skies of silver, stars of gold
And now you know just what you like
So far this love is all I have
So far this hurt is all I have
Missing person at the window
Missing person at the window
A missing person at the window
Missing person at the window, yeah
I wonder where you are
I wonder where you are
I wonder where you are, wonder where you
