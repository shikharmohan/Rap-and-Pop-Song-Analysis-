Say the words, played the part. 
Gave the world and plus my heart. 
Did it all with a smile on my face...
 
Gave you love,mind and soul. 
Thought that it was mutual. 
I see now that that wasn't the case... 
( Pre-Chorus )
(look at me now)
Not exactly who I was when you last saw me. 
Baby I've grown into a man who knows the deal 
(playn around)
with my emotions is a thing of the past,sorry. 
Said I become a bit too slick and that's for real.
( Chorus )
I was in love ...
Silly me,silly me. 
I was what you wanted me to be 
But not anymore, not anymore.
I was in love ... 
Silly you silly you 
I refuse to be your fool 
Not anymore... 
Sugar what's with your eyes? 
Why do you look so surprised? 
Is it 'cause your game has no effect? 
( Girl it ain't working ) 
And I've developed such a swagger, 
sharp as a dagger and a mind that just won't fall for it. 
( Pre-Chorus } 
(look at me now)
Not exactly who I was when you last saw me. 
Baby I've grown into a man who knows the deal 
(playn around)
My emotions is a thing of the past,sorry. 
Said I become a bit too slick and that's for real.
HEY!
( Chorus )
I was in love ...
Silly me,silly me. 
I was what you wanted me to be 
But not anymore, not anymore.
I was in love ... 
Silly you silly you...YOUU! 
I refuse to be your fool...BE YOUR FOOL! 
Not anymore... 
Im glad you thought that...
I'm unhappy without you 
Glad you can see I'm fine...HEY!
So what you coming round for...BABY? 
Girl I don't need you anymore.. 
( Chorus )
I was in love ...
Silly me,silly me. 
I was what you wanted me to be 
But not anymore, not anymore.
I was in love ... 
Silly you silly you 
I refuse to be your fool 
Not anymore...
