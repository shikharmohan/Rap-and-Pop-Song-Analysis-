(featuring The-Dream)
Ohh yeah
Waaaahhh
Yeah
[Ciara:]
Lead me out on the floor
Bring ya body closer
Take it all, give me more, do me like ya supposed to
Move with me left and right slide your hands over mine
Using all your imagination, leave everything behind
[The-Dream:]
Take my hand, lay on my face
Feel my heart tumbling
[Ciara:]
Dark corners, flashing lights, keep the music coming
[The-Dream:]
I'm off the earth, on the stars
I ain't worried about tommorrow
[Ciara and The-Dream:]
Keep going 'till the world disappears
Keep dancing on me...
Ohh...
Uh ooh...
On me...
('Till the world)...
Keep dancing on me...
Ohh...
Uh ooh
On me...
[Ciara:]
Take the lead, raise the floor
Take a turn, pass the shadow
[The-Dream:]
Taste the air, touch me there
Lean to me, nothing matters
Tell my ears truthful lies...
[Ciara:]
Honest whispers make me sigh...
Send me left...
[The-Dream:]
Send me right
[Ciara:]
I'm going outta my mind
See me smile, make me want to go on and on
I'm in peace sincerity, I'm where I belong
[The-Dream:]
I'm off the earth, on the stars
I ain't worried about tommorrow
[Ciara and The-Dream:]
Keep going 'till the world disappears
Keep dancing on me...
Ohh...
Uh ooh...
On me...
('Till the world)...
Keep dancing on me...
Ohh...
Uh ooh
On me...
[Ciara:]
Hold me bay, deep inside your mind
[The-Dream:]
Stay with me one more song
[Ciara:]
Until my body is melting away, away, away
[Ciara and The-Dream:]
Keep dancing on me...
Ohh...
Uh ooh...
On me...
('Till my body's melting away)...
Keep dancing on me...
Ohh...
Uh ooh
(On me, on me, on me, on me, on me)
On me...
Keep dancing on me...
Ohh...
Uh ooh...
On me...
