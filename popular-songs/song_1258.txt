I got caught in between
I just let love win
I'm not prod of you
But I can't change what I feel
I believed in you
You took care of me
Were you faking all this time?
Why did you leave?
Now I'm numb,
I can barely breath
CHORUS:
You couldn't resist me
So scared
You had to leave me
Empty as I am
Face your demons
I'm here to stay
Please don't leave me
Empty as I am
I feel so stupid
So betrayed
I gave you my trust
And this is how you pay
You think I won't fight for this
I'll do what it takes
I'm willing to give up my life
Just to have one more kiss
Now I'm empty
I can barely feel
CHORUS:
You couldn't resist me
So scared
You had to leave me
Empty as I am
Face your demons
I'm here to stay
Please don't leave me
Empty as I am
