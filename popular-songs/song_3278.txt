Let's go 
If your sittin' at home talking to him on the phone, 
And he clone, with no style of his own. 
You wishin' that you was gone, throwin back the patron. 
You aint wrong cause you'd rather be with me in the zone. 
Let's go 
Sorry, your lady has been taken. 
You can find us up in the mo wit the flow shakin, 
And I aint even the one that's bringin her home the bacon. 
You the one been talking bout kickin my face in? 
Let's go 
You can do whateva you gonna.

The problem is you dead as a coma. 
You sick of me, but I'm right here to put the medicine on ya. 
Let's go 
Got'em all frightened of the titan,you mice men too light to get fights in with the bison. 
Its so excitin' my Benz reeled your wife in, I'll ruin your life when i produce a license! 
Let's go 
comin' through door, hella fast, never slow, got the cash, and the pedal to the floor. 
Let's go 
If you wanna ride, let me know. we can slide on the low. Whatcha standin there for? 
Let's go 
You can hate cause I'm dippin witcha mate. Out the gate, let's roll, let's bounce, let's skate. 
Let's go to the room, let's go to the lick. Let's go, Your boyfriend aint talking bout shit.

Get in this car. I'm a star, you aint noticed yet? 
Look at these shoes, look at these jewels shinin on my neck. 
I spit that venom, then I send em in to remove her denim, 
And once I'm in em, then I bend em, and I can't rememb'em'. 
I stay persistent and consistent when it comes to pimpin.
