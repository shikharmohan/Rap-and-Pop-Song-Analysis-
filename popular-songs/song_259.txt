I know you probably think a girl
Like me is oh, so vain
Because I love it when the camera man
Screams out my name
He says, hey girl, look here
Turn left, right, up, down, pose
And I feel so beautiful while I'm wearing
These designer clothes
I feel so pretty, picture perfect, beautiful
(Picture perfect, beautiful)
Don't you feel pretty like you're putting on a show?
(A, a, a show)
And the cameras go
Click, click, click, flash
(You, you, you beautiful, baby)
And the cameras go
Click, click, click, flash
(You, you, you beautiful, baby)
Now I'm feeling like a queen
I love your eyes on me
My hair is blowing in the wind
I'm so sexy and free
And when my make up is on
I feel like a rock star
The sun is shining on me
Oh yes, I'm living large
I feel so pretty, picture perfect, beautiful
(Picture perfect, beautiful)
Don't you feel pretty like you're putting on a show?
(A, a, a show)
And the cameras go
Click, click, click, flash
(You, you, you beautiful, baby)
And the cameras go
Click, click, click, flash
(You, you, you beautiful, baby)
Snap, snap, freeze, pose
Look back, look back
Man, I ain't never seen a girl walk like that
Uh, let's go
I got my Kodak acts to magic
I grab it and I click and flash
They grab they camera phones
Whenever I be switching pass
So ultra fabulous, my jeans, my jeans
They fit me crazy
Them boys be yelling out
You beautiful baby
I feel so pretty, picture perfect, beautiful
(Picture perfect, beautiful)
Don't you feel pretty like you're putting on a show?
(A, a, a show)
And the cameras go
Click, click, click, flash
(You, you, you beautiful, baby)
And the cameras go
Click, click, click, flash
(You, you, you beautiful, baby)
I feel so pretty, picture perfect, beautiful

Don't you feel pretty like you're putting on a show?
