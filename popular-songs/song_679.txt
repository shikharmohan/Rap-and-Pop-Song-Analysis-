We can make it, we can make it
We can make it last, we can make it last
We can make it
We can make it last, we can make it last
We can make it
We can make it last, we can make it
I can't wait, wanna see
How this night is gonna be
Just a touch away
From a feeling that is here to stay
We can make it last forever, baby
Our love will stand the test of time
In the middle of the world
I'll be waiting for you to be all mine
We're walking on sunshine
In the middle of the night
And it feels like I'm somewhere
Above the sky
We're walking on sunshine
In the middle of the night
And it feels like I'm somewhere
Above the sky
Take my hand, close your eyes
Say the sweet little things that make me cry
Catch my tears, with a kiss
These special moments do exist
We can make it last forever, baby
Our love will stand the test of time
In the middle of our world
I'll be waiting for you to be all mine
We're walking on sunshine
In the middle of the night
And it feels like I'm somewhere
Above the sky
We're walking on sunshine
In the middle of the night
And it feels like I'm somewhere
Above the sky
Let's take a chance and try love, baby
No, I'm not giving up
Till you tell me that you'll be in my life
Until the end of time
We can make it, we can make it
We can make it last, we can make it last
We can make it
We can make it last, we can make it last
We can make it
We're walking on sunshine
In the middle of the night
And it feels like I'm somewhere
Above the sky
We're walking on sunshine
In the middle of the night
And it feels like I'm somewhere
Above the sky
We're walking on sunshine
In the middle of the night
And it feels like I'm somewhere
Above the sky
We're walking on sunshine
In the middle of the night
And it feels like I'm somewhere
Above the sky
We can make it, we can make it
We can make it last, we can make it last
We can make it
We can make it last, we can make it last
We can make it
We can make it last, we can make it
