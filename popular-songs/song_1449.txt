Starin out into the wild blue yonder
So many thoughts to sit and ponder about life and love and the lack of and this emptiness in my heart.
Too old to be wild and free still 
Too young to be over the hill still
Trying to grow up but who knows where to start
So ill just sit right here and have another beer in mexico
do my best to waste another day
Sit right here and have another beer in mexico
Let the warm air melt these blues away
Sun comes up sun sinks down, ive seen them both in this tourist town
up for days in the rain just trying to search my soul
For all the answers and the reasons why
I'm at these crossroads in my life, really dont know which way to go
So ill just sit right here and have another beer in mexico
do my best to waste another day
Sit right here and have another beer in mexico
Let the warm air melt these blues away
Maybe i'll settle down, get married or stay single and stay free 
which road ill travel its still a mystery to me
So ill just sit right here and have another beer in mexico
do my best to waste another day
Sit right here and have another beer in mexico
Let the warm air melt these blues away 
Down in mexico
