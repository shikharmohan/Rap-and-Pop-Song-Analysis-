I picked you out in a crowd
Of a thousand faces
Yeah, I found you, Ohhhh
I chose the whys and the whens
All around and places
Yeah, I choose you, Ohhhh
I let you see me
Let you believe it was your move
So smooth
My rules
Well you think you are the one
Who got me boy
But I got you
I've been playing with you
Like a little toy
Yeah, I got you
I got you
I got you
You'd be surprised, all the times
That I almost told you
But I stayed cool, Ohhhh
I almost broke but I
Knew I would get to hold you
Cause I'm no fool, Ohhhh
You came up to me
And did the very thing I knew
That you'd do
Ohohohohohhhh
Well you think you are the one
Who got me boy
But I got you
I've been playing with you
Like a little toy
Yeah, I got you
You gave me all control
(I got you)
I took your heart and soul
(I got you)
For me, I'm gonna roll
I got you, you, you
I got you
I got you
And I love it
I got you
Yeah, I got you
I got you
And I love it
I got you
Yeah, I got you
Well you think you are the one
Who got me boy
But I got you
I've been playing with you
Like a little toy
Yeah, I got you
I got you
And I love it
I got you
Yeah, I got you
I got you
And I love it
I got you
Yeah, I got you
