Empty arms that long for you
And they wait dear just for you
And these arms will stay this way
Till you return to them someday
Each lonely night I go to bed
I hug the pillow where you used to lay your head
Empty arms but not for long
'Cause my baby's coming home
And when he walks through the door
These empty arms I'll have no more
And when he walks through that door
These empty arms I'll have no more
These empty arms I'll have no more
