It sure gets quiet when the kids go to bed
We sit here in the silence, putting off what must be said
I read a book you watch TV, as our love dies quietly
I'm so sad I don't know what I've just read
Somebody should leave, but which one should it be
You need the kids and they need me
Somebody should leave, but we hate to give in
We keep hoping somehow we might need each other again
You say goodnight and turn and face the wall
We lie here in the darkness and the tears start to fall
If it was only you and me goodbye might come more easily
But what about those babies down the hall
Somebody should leave, but which one should it be
You need the kids and they need me
Somebody should leave, but we hate to give in
We keep hoping somehow we might need each other again
Somebody should leave, but we hate to give in
We just keep hoping, we might need each other again
