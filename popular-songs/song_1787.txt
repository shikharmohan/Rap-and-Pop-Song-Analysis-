Every week's the same, stuck in school, so lame
My parents say that I'm lazy
Getting up at 8 a.m's crazy
Tired of being told what to do, so unfair, so uncool
The day's too long and I'm holding on
Till I hear the bell ring
'Cause that's the time when we're gonna
Time when we're gonna
Breakout! Let the party start
We're gonna stay out, gonna break some hearts
We're gonna dance 'til the dance floor falls apart
Uh oh, all over again
We're gonna wake up everyone we know
We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control
It feels so good to let go-o-o
Hanging out's just something we like to do
My friends and the mess we get into
These are the lessons that we chose
Not a book full of things we'll never use
The day's too long and I'm holding on
Till I hear the bell ring
'Cause that's the time when we're gonna
Time when we're gonna
Breakout! Let the party start
We're gonna stay out, gonna break some hearts
We're gonna dance 'til the dance floor falls apart
Uh oh, all over again
We're gonna wake up everyone we know
We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control
It feels so good to let go-o-o
I wish it would never end
Spending time with my friends
Oh, with my friends!
Breakout! Let the party start
We're gonna stay out, gonna break some hearts
We're gonna dance 'til the dance floor falls apart
Uh oh, all over again
We're gonna wake up everyone we know
We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control
It feels so good to let go
Breakout! Let the party start
We're gonna stay out, gonna break some hearts
We're gonna dance 'til the dance floor falls apart
Uh oh, all over again
We're gonna wake up everyone we know
We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control
It feels so good to let go-o-o
