I just found this old picture in my wallet
Of you and me, down in Mexico
Just look at us there on that beach, on that blanket
That look on our face says all you need to know
Seems like everywhere we go, baby, love goes everywhere
Everytime our hearts meet, love is all around us
Every road we take, darlin', love takes every turn
Livin' right inside us, I believe love goes everywhere we go
Sometimes I dream, we're alone on an island
Nowhere to go, well, we don't wanna leave
All that we have is a world full of time
We spend it all on you and me, it's all that we need
Seems like everywhere we go, baby, love goes everywhere
Everytime our hearts meet, love is all around us
Every road we take, darlin', love takes every turn
Livin' right inside us, I believe love goes everywhere we go
I'm so alive when I'm near you
This fire in my heart lights the world when I'm with you
Every road we take, darlin', love takes every turn
Livin' right inside us, I believe love goes everywhere we go
I believe love goes everywhere we go, everywhere we go
