Some people say I'm one of those guys with blessings in life overlooked
Sometimes I feel like the tatter torn pages of some old paperback book
All the places I've played and the money I've made still I've got nothing to show
And the only thing that I have left in the whole wide world is you
You put your whole life into somethin' you love and you never get that one big break
That'll take you out of the back street bars and put you on center stage
But a million tears and a million beers have just about washed me up
And the only thing that I have left in the whole wide world is you
I gave it all I had every night for all these years
Pourin' out my soul 'til it was gone
I spread myself so thin and I'm just barely hangin' on
But tonight I'm with you and you can carry me through
Just love me
''cause the only thing that I have left in the whole wide world is you
I gave it all I had every night for all these years
Pourin' out my soul 'til it was gone
I spread myself so thin and I'm just barely hangin' on
But tonight I'm with you and you can carry me through
Just love me
''cause the only thing that I have left in the whole wide world is you
Oh, is you
