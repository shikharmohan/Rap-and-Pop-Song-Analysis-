Love takes the patience of Job
That's what my Mama always said
Faith is the belief in something more than what you know
That's what the good book says
You gotta play the cards you got
Who knows what fate is holding
At times you gotta go
Without knowing where you're going
That's why I keep on lovin' you, I keep on lovin' you
Through the baby-don't-leave-mes
And never-will-agains
And I-promise-tos, I keep on lovin' you
Lord knows we've had our share of fights
Our sleepless nights, our ups and downs
We've had plenty and then some
Of baby-I'm-gones and turnarounds
Sometimes I swear it might be easier
To throw in the towel
Someday we're gonna look back
And say look at us now
That's why I keep on lovin' you, I keep on lovin' you
Through the baby-don't-leave-mes
And never-will-agains
And I-promise-tos
I keep on lovin' you, keep on lovin' you
Through the I-take-it-backs
I-didn't-mean-it-like-thats
I'd-never-hurt-yous, oh, I keep on lovin' you
I keep on lovin' you, I keep on lovin' you
Through the baby-don't-leave-mes
And never-will-agains
And I-promise-tos
I keep on lovin' you, I keep on lovin' you
Through the I-take-it-backs
I-didn't-mean-it-like-thats
I'd-never-hurt-yous, oh, I keep on lovin' you
I keep on lovin' you, I keep on lovin' you
