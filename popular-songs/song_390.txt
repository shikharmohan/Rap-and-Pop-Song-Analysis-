I learned how to write it when I first started school
Some bully didn't like it he said it didn't sound too cool
So I had to hit him and all I said when the blood came
It's my last name
Grandpa took it off to Europe to fight the Germans in the war
It came back on some dog tags nobody wears no more
It's written on a headstone in the field where he was slain
It's my last name
Passed down from generations too far back to trace
I can see all my relations when I look into my face
May never make it famous but I'll never bring it shame
It's my last name
Daddy always told me far back as I recall
Son you're part of something, you represent us all
So keep it how you got it as solid as it came
It's my last name
Passed down from generations too far back to trace
I can see all my relations when I look into my face
May never make it famous but I'll never bring it shame
It's my last name
So darlin' if you're wonderin' why I've got you here tonight
I wanna be your husband, I want you to be my wife
I ain't got much to give you but what I've got means everything
It's my last name, oh, it's my last name, yeah
