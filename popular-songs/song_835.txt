Hmm
Hey yo, nephew, check this out man
Now I know you got that bad chick right there
You ain't even tripping off of her
But she doing all of that for you
She got this, she got that
She's off the hizzle
I mean when you find one like that
You got to make that change man
'Coz they don't come too often
And when they do come
You gotta be smart enough to know when to change
Like Sam Cooke say, "Change gon' come", nephew
And you better believe that
As I look back on all that I've done to you
My biggest regrets, the things that I never could do
I see the light now baby it's shining through
Gotta give up the game, yeah, I got some changin' to do
I won't get high if you want it
Get that straight, 9 to 5 if you want it
Keep my ass home at night if you want it
Whatever you need me to do
When you talk I'ma listen
Give you all that attention you missing
Girl, I swear, I'ma handle my business
Just like a real man should do
I can change
I can change
I can change for you
I can change
I can change
I can change for you
Hmm yeah
Hmm
I, I'll give up all the places I used to go
Stay out the club, stay home because I'm with you, yeah yeah
I'll give up all those girls that I used to know
They don't compare, baby, I swear it's the truth
So I'm through with the women
Yeah, that's right, I give up on the pimpin'
Girl I'm gonna repent from my sinnin'
If that's what you want me to do
I'll get right if you want it
Go to church, get baptized if you want it
Girl, you opened my eyes and I'm gonna
Be much better for you
Baby believe me
Baby believe me
I can change
I can change
I can change for you

Uh uh, take me to the river and baptize my soul
I'm so outta control, needing someone to hold
Man it's cold, I ain't been clubbin', drinkin' or smokin'
I'm focused, bowin' down every night prayin' and hopin'
I'm trying to figure out a way
But I just don't know how to say
But I'm rearrangin', hopefully I'm changin'
And you can see that
Baby, 'coz it's hard for me
Kinda sorta odd for me
But ain't nothing to it, if you need me to do it
I guess
I can change

I can change for you
