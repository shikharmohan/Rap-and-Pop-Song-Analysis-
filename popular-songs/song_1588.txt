The other side, the other side, the other side of me
By day I play the part in every way
All simple, sweet, calm and collected
Pretend to my friends I'm a chameleon
You make a girl feel disconnected
Feel like a star, a super hero
Sometimes it's hard to separate
(Got too much on my plate)
If you could see the other side of me
I'm just like anybody else, can't you tell?
I hold the key to both realities
The girl that I want you want to know
If only I could show
The other side, the other side I want you to see
The other side, the other side, the other side of me
Inside I try to make the pieces fit right
A jigsaw puzzle everywhere
'Cause I flip this script so many times I forget
Who's on stage, who's in the mirror
Back in the spotlight, the crowd is calling
The paparazzi and the fame
(It can drive a girl insane)
If you could see the other side of me
I'm just like anybody else, can't you tell?
I hold the key to both realities
The girl that I want you want to know
If only I could show
The other side, the other side I want you to see
The other side, the other side, the other side of me
Down inside I'm not that different
Like everyone I have a dream
Don't want to hide, just want to fit in
Sometimes it's harder than it seems
If you could see the other side of me
I'm just like anybody else, can't you tell?
I hold the key to both realities
The girl that I want you want to know
If you could see the other side of me
I'm just like anybody else, can't you tell?
I hold the key to both realities
The girl that I want you want to know
If only I could show
The other side, the other side I want you to see
The other side, the other side, the other side of me
The other side, the other side I want you to see
The other side, the other side, the other side of me
