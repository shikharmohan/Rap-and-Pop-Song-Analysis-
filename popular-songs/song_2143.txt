Clean up before she comes
Clean up before she comes
Clean up before she comes
Clean up before she comes
Living in a dusty town
Living in a dusty town
Something in her eyes
Must be the smoke from my lungs
Something in her eyes
Must be the smoke from my lungs
Twenty months has it all
I must be getting old
I must be getting old
I must be getting old
Something in her eyes
Must be the smoke from my lungs
Something in her eyes
Must be the smoke from my lungs
Clean up the dusty town
Living in a dusty town
Living in a dusty town
Living in a dusty town
Clean up before she comes
Clean up before she comes
Clean up before she comes
Living in a dusty town
Something in her eyes
Must be the smoke from my lungs
Something in her eyes
Must be the smoke from my lungs
I must be getting old
I must be getting old
I must be getting older
I'm starting to eat my vegetables
I must be getting older
I'm starting to eat my vegetables
I must be getting older
I'm starting to eat my vegetables
