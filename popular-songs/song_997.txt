Every...everywhere I go I'm a star, damn Kanye is that yo car?
Niggas rappin the gold but we can't tell
You claim you got hoes but we can't tell
You claim you gettin dough dawg we can't tell
You bought one pair of ones at a two-for-one sale
Politics catch me at the end of the mixtape
So I dropped my own "Get Well Soon" from mixtape
The drug game bolemic it's hard to get weight
So niggas' money is homo it's hard to get straight
I'm trynna do numbers like Pac did 
But it ain't Shakur this the brand new Roc kid
Niggas wanna get me like they got BIG
Cause I moved up out the city and got big
And that's the poison that runs through their veins and attack their soul and just start to tear em up
Niggas talk so muh shit about me in barbershops they forget to get their hair cut
Ok fair enough, the streets is flarin up 
Cause they want gun talk and I don't go there enough
But don't get it fucked up you can still get your head bust
I'm makin wy too much dough to be playin
And this is a classic in the making, history repeats itself
He do the rhymes and the beats himself
The only child syndrome make hits on hs own
And I'mma look in the mirror if I need some help
Ya'll bout to blow man we can't tell
You claim you got hoes man we can't tell
You claim you gettin dough nigga we can't tell
You bought one pair of ones at a two-for-one sale
I'm gettin eyes by the case like Dirty
I made it to the Power 30 a whole hour early
I'mma pull out the shank and bang ya
I'mma cut a nigga up like LL trainer
This is the future of the Chi
This is the legacy of Twist, flickin Do or Die
So first of all who am I? (Who am I?)
My...my...my name is Kanye and that Cambridge
At home like Cambridge, look at what I came with?
No, none of that same shit that new and improved
And I don't know if me or how yellow my Roc-A-Fella chain is
But I'm so La smooth I ain't got nothin to prove
You niggas bout blow dawg we can't tell
You claim you got hoes dawg we can't tell
You claim you gettin dough nigga we can't tell
You bought one pair of ones at a two-for-one sale
Everywhere I go I'm a star, damn Kanye is that yo car?
Every...everywhere I go I'm a star, damn Kanye is that yo car?
