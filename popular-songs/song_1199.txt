You brought that bottle home in a paper sack
You drew the blinds and locked the door
And there's nothin' but empty there inside that glass
So you pour a little more
And there's no one there to judge you
At least that's what you tell yourself
But don't you know, nobody drinks alone?
Every demon, every ghost from your past
And every memory you've held back, follows you home
Nobody drinks alone
You remember whiskey on your Daddy's breath
So you always stick to wine
And you scared your little brother half to death
You just kept it all inside
And you can hear your Mama cryin'
Only now she cries for you
And don't you know, nobody drinks alone?
Every demon, every ghost from your past
And every memory you've held back follows you home, ohh
Nobody drinks alone, no no ohh
Ohh ohh
Though you're lonely
Hey, don't you let that feelin' fool you
And don't you know
  (Oh don't you know, don't you know?)
Nobody drinks alone?
(Nobody)
(Nobody)
Every demon, every ghost
From your past
And every memory you've held back
Follows you home, ohh
Nobody drinks alone
Nobody drinks alone
Uhh uhh uhh
