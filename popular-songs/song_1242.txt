You're all I need to get by
Like the sweet morning dew
I took one look at you
And it was plain to see
You were my destiny
With my arms open wide
I threw away my pride
I'll sacrifice for you
Dedicate my life for you
I will go where you lead
Always there in time of need
And when I lose my will
You'll be there to push me up the hill
There's no, no looking back for us
We got love sure enough, it's enough
You're all, you're all I want to strive for and do a little more
You're all, all the joys under the sun wrapped up into one
You're all, you're all I need
You're all I need , oh yeah, yeah
You're all I need to get by
Oh you are
Oh you are
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Aw, yeah
