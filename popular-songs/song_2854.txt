Well, I'm sitting on the bus
Rolling down through Georgia
Don't know where I'm going
And I don't care what's new
I've got nothing to lose
Well, I've had no sleep going on three days
Finished this old paperback
Somewhere near Atlanta, it's true
I've got nothing to lose
Nothing to lose
Since I've lost you, feeling all alone
I used to have it all
And now my heart is gone, it's true
I've got nothing to lose
Well, we're coming up on Macon
Gonna rest here a spell
Making idle conversation
With a stranger without you
I've got nothing to lose
Nothing to lose
Since I've lost you, feeling all alone
I used to have it all
And now my heart is gone, it's true
I've got nothing to lose
Ooh, nothing to lose
Ooh, since I've lost you
You left me with no worries
You left with no cares
You took my whole life with you
The you left me standing there, it's true
I've got nothing to lose
Nothing to lose
Since I've lost you, feeling all alone
I used to have it all
And now my heart is gone, it's true
I've got nothing to lose
Yeah, it's true, I've got nothing to lose
I've got nothing, nothing left to lose
I've got nothing, nothing left to lose
I've got nothing, nothing left to lose
Ooh, nothing to lose
Ooh, nothing to lose
