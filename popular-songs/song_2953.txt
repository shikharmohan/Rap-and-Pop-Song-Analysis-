So you like Sunday picnics
And yelling at the umpire at a baseball game
Window shopping, popcorn popping
Wading through the puddles in a summer rain
And I'll bet you're kind to children and
Someday you'd like to be a mother too
And do you get a feeling when you're with me, the way I do?
Well that makes two of us
We're like birds of a feather
True love brings together
A precious few of us
That makes two of us
So you believe in wishes
While blowin' out the candles on a birthday cake
Gentle hugs and lightnin' bugs
Stayin' up all night to watch the morning break
We've got so much in common
Given half a chance, I'm sure that you'll agree
One way to sum up forever is you and me
Well that makes two of us
We're like birds of a feather
True love brings together
A precious few of us
That makes two of us
