I've been called a rambler
'Cause I keep my eyes on that horizon line
And I've been called a gambler
'Cause I always wanna let my winnin's ride
I've been broke more times than I can count
I've been stuck for days in a lonely town
When my luck ran south
Hey, I might be makin' me a reputation
Of goin' my own way and I can't live it down
Got the throttle wide open, gonna live it up knowin'
In this life you only get one go around
And I can't live it down
There's times I've wasted money
'Cause I know that I can always make more cash
But wasted time is somethin', man
When it's gone, you can't get it back
So I'll go on burnin' up both ends
'Cause I don't want a whole lotta might've-beens
Now that would be a sin
Hey, I might be makin' me a reputation
Of goin' my own way and I can't live it down
Got the throttle wide open, gonna live it up knowin'
In this life you only get one go around
And I can't live it down
Gonna live for places I ain't been
Make a lot more good remember-whens
Right up to the end
Yeah, I might be makin' me a reputation
Of goin' my own way and I can't live it down
Got the throttle wide open, gonna live it up knowin'
In this life you only get one go around
And I can't live it down
I can't live it down, I can't live it down
