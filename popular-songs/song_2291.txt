[Omarion talking:]
Yeah, uhh, Yeah
I don't know if yall
ready for this one right here
Omarion Solo, Yall aint ready
It's time, Tick, Tock, Tick, Tock
[Verse One:]
One, and here comes the two to the three 
And four
Girl yo` body sick, 
You the hottest thang on the floor. 
You bustin` through them AppleBottom jeans 
And I can't stop gettin next to you
'cause I'm a fein 
Lookin` at my wrist, staring at my pinky ring
Whispering in my ear real close
Sayin` kinky things 
Tattoo on the small of your back 
And ya booty so fat, mami shake that
[Chorus:]
Damn
Shorty got a hold of me
Shorty tryna take control me
Got me sayin, damn
Shorty wanna roll with me
Shorty wanna be involved with me
She got me like damn
[Repeat]
[Verse 2:]
Now we sneakin out the back door of the club
Girl I know you tipsy
Homie rollin` with me, swiftly, simply
'cause she fellin love when she kissed me
Just one touch, and shorty was history
And I aint tryna brag or boast, but ya body jivey
Need a good lovin` from a somebody 
And the way you was moving, I could see you know..
What you doin girl...lets get to it girl...
[Chorus:]
Damn
Shorty got a hold of me
Shorty tryna take control me
Got me sayin, damn
Shorty wanna roll with me
Shorty wanna be involved with me
Baby i'm like damn
[Repeat]
Whooo Whooo, Yeah, Yall aint ready, Omarion, Yeah, whoooo Damn, Damn.
[Repeat Chorus again]
