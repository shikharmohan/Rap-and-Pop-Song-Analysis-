I left Oklahoma driving in a Pontiac
Just about to lose my mind
I was going to Arizona maybe on to California
Where the people all live so fine
My baby said I was crazy
My moma called me lazy
I was gonna show'em all this time
Cause you know I ain't no fooling
I don't need no more school'in
I was born to just walk the line
Chorus:                                             
Livin on Tulsa time, livin on Tulsa time
Well you know I've been through it
When I set my watch back to it 
Livin on Tulsa time
Where there I was in Hollywood
Wishing I was doing good
Talking on telephone line
But they don't need me in the movies
And nobody sings my songs
Guess I'm just wasting time
Well then I got to thinking
Man I'm really sinking
And I really had a flash this time
I had no business leaving
And nobody would be grieving
If I went on back to Tulsa time
Repeat chorus
