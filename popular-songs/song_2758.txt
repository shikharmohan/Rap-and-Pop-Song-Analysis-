Saturday night out on the town feeling so sure of myself
Meeting some friends, sharing some laughs
Not thinking of anything else
Then one of them leaned over my shoulder
And all at once the party was over
They asked about you and suddenly it all came back to me
Then all the walls around my heart came crashing at my feet
When they asked about you they asked about you
I was doing okay until they asked about you
How could they know what it would do?
All they did was mention your name
And just like that the hurting was back
That's when I knew nothing had changed
What a time for old memories to find me
Just when I thought I'd put 'em behind me
They asked about you and suddenly it all came back to me
Then all the walls around my heart came crashing at my feet
When they asked about you they asked about you
I was doing okay until they asked about you
I was doing okay until they asked about you
