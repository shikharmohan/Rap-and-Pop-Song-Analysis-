If you like a man who you can put your trust in
You don't have to worry where he's been
Then rest easy
Girl, you're gonna love me
And if you like to slow dance to ol' Keith Whitley
Long Sunday drives out in the country
I'm your cup of tea
Girl, you're gonna love me
Come and rest your head against my chest
'Cause I'm the one for you
You don't have to look no more
Your search is through
So girl if you like a handful of fresh wild flowers
A back rub on a bad day talkin' for hours
I'm good company
Girl you're gonna love me
Come and rest your head against my chest
'Cause I'm the one for you
You don't have to look no more
Your search is through
So girl if you like a big heart that's in this for the long haul
Till we're rockin' on the front porch and they're callin' me papaw
Till the last breath you breathe
Girl, you're gonna love me
Just try it and see
Girl, you're gonna love me
