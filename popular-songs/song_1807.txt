What...
Could you, hope to achieve?
When I'm cryin' and you know why.
How...Do you find your reasons,
In my deepest, darkness night?
I keep givin' you up.
I remember when,
You were my only friend
Now I'm not...sure you can,
Feel like that..again.
I keep givin' you up.
[CHORUS]
And My,
You know my mind's made up, this time.
There's no goin' back to find,
What we had.
And I know,
There's no light here left to shine.
There's no wrong where's there's no right,
So enough.
I'm givin you up.
All the things that you said,
Well you seem to forget.
They surround, in my head,
Every night.
There's a battle within,
That I'll never win.
'Cause it's me that I'm up against.
'Cause it's my heart, versus common sense.
[CHORUS]
And my,
You know my mind's made up, this time.
There's no goin' back to find,
What we had.
And I know,
There's no light here left to shine.
There's no wrong, where's there's no right,
So enough.
I'm givin' you up
Stip the layers,
Make me better,
Help me get out clean
Show your colours
I'm slipping under
Help me throught this..please
[CHORUS]
And my,
You know my mind's made up, this time.
There's no goin' back to find,
What we had.
And I know,
There's no light here left to shine.
There's no wrong, where's there's no right,
So enough.
I'm givin' you up
My minds made up,
I'm givin' you up [x3]
