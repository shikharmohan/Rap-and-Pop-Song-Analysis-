I knew I could never hold that girl
She was born to see the world
And all I got is a picture she mailed me
Barefoot in the snow white sand
A bag of sea shells in her hand
She finally found a paradise it seems
And on the coast of somewhere beautiful
Trade winds blowin' through her hair
The sunlight dancin' on the water and I wish I was there
Don't know how I'm gonna find her, all I know so far
She's on the coast of somewhere beautiful, runnin' with my heart
Sometimes when the sun goes down
Shadows fall across this little town
And I close my eyes and I drift away
To another place in another time
When the world was ours and she was mine
I dream of holdin' her again someday
And on the coast of somewhere beautiful
Trade winds blowin' through her hair
Sunlight dancin' on the water and I wish I was there
Don't know how I'm gonna find her, all I know so far
She's on the coast of somewhere beautiful, runnin' with my heart
Don't know how I'm goin' to find her and all I know so far
She's on the coast of somewhere beautiful runnin' with my heart
Oh she's runnin' with my heart
And on the coast of somewhere beautiful
