H.I.G.H.L.A.N.D Highland nigga
H.artless I.saine G.etto H.odlum L.vin' A.d N.ver D.in'
That's what I'm talkin' about 
Rogue dawgs, when I call my Rogue dawgs
Rogue Dawg, niggas
Fa the nine-eight
We'll have to crash 'em like this nigga, yeah
[chorus]
My nigga my nigga we soldiers at war
Killin' off our enemies 'til it aint no more
Laws we break yo' shit we'll take
Murder fo them bustas and hatas it aint no escape
Rogue Dawg fo life!
It's the beginin of the endin fo yo ass
You broke ass niggas hit the strip we need mo cash
This midwest side hittin' like a M-1 time to get some
Payback fo you bustas that laid back
My gats aint met yo next so fuck yo vest we dumpin'
Killin' all that punk shit that you heart be pumpin'
See somethin' I take it cuttin' through the red tape
Yo legs break tryin' to catch up who who led the race
It's 5-7 Highas heaven causin' insanity 
Whatcha handin' me we'll have you bitch ass postin' the vanity ??s
Gotta recoop fuckin' with these troops
Soon as we see you Load up and we shoot on site
We turnin' out the lights my appetite for destruction
Got me in the mood for bustin' dumpin' accross the mizzou
And get to huntin' for Kevin Eastda oo-oo 
And nigga you knew da Rogue Dawgs rule!
Your so called truths get battered and bruised
Stackin' you fools so deadly it don't matter the tools
I'm afta my dues prove if you snooze you looze
Prepare for war when you fuckin' wit my crew 
Rogue for life!
[chorus]
265 lbs. all nigga 
And I'm good wit these dawgs nigga
Got steel plated balls nigga
Representin' 57th street 
Me and my Dawgs bringin' the heat
Born and raised to be a villain on these Kansas City Streets
Best retreat when you hear my Dawgs barkin 
Snarlin' got that blood boilin'
Midwest side carved in hangin' out the chevy now we blastin' and laughin'
Made to hit me smashin' on them bastards
Don't be talkin' when they ask you shit got drastic on that bastard
Left him fo da cats that sent them straight to hell
Just like hosts of veil another soldier's tale 
Nigga the life of a coward was taken when we bailed
Look I swore to die for bloodline more heartless than my father brought (nigga)
Load the cartridges with hollow point hard ones
When Rogue dawgs call it's an all out war move 
56 marks it 'cause 56 swore to
Heartless insaine ghetto hoodlum livin and never dyin'
Midwest side until my last breath on highland 
Why should I lie? I live an die for my side 
Ride the city 'til they roll with diddy one last time
Let this n9ne yell out fuckem 
Fuckem if he's gon walk he's nothin'
Fuck where he's from he'll even run when I'm comin'
Rogue dawg fo life no fear of death no mo
I swore to live a life a soldier at war
Rogue dawg fo life!
[Chorus]
Are you afraid of the unknown brains get blown
Expose chrome to your dome 'til you stiff as stone
With the phone neva suck it I'm goin'
In the pockets and blowin muthafuckas to smitherines
You knowin' that it ain't no niggas stickin' me like K-do
Be warned I'm able to explode like a volcano 
On y'all we told y'all we Rogue Dawgs 
We know y'all this one is Hong Kong
Fo' you bustas and hatas we (gotta make that paper)
Can't break us then take us I'll peel you like a potato
Nigga wait a minute got me bustin' like a lieutenant 
My intent is to eliminate you cynics
Rogue Fo' Life!!
These young niggas always yellin' about ridin'
But these bustas ain't no muthafuckin' ridas
These wannabe hustlas can't compare to midwest sidas
I pumpst a cock up in they bitch and then I'm slidin'
I'm rollin' deep wit my troopas fixin'ta expose the chrome
Detramental to domes though ozone 
Thousands of bodies bein' found around me
Bottles of bud and double-U-double E-D
N9ne milla rhyme killa
Fuck wit me I'll take that bust of myron D 
And throw 'em to mah Dawgs in the red sea
Now lets see if he can swim back to shore
Chunks missin' yellin' I don't wanna mess wit tech no more
I know you don't Tech N9ne I never say it again nigga
I know you won't never will these niggas lit on my friend
And mista scare crow bitch nigga you ain't got to lie
You just a scared ho Nigga this is highland 'til we die
We got the triple life coast to roll wit Rogue Dawg shit
Bitches and niggas all on the balls when it hit
I neva could understand how a nigga could come so whack
What? o I ain't talkin about me I'm talkin' about them other cats
Troopa!
[Chorus]
My nigga my nigga we soldiers at war
Killin' off our enemies 'til it ain't no more!
