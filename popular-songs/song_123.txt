It's been a long and winding journey
But I'm finally here tonight
Picking up the pieces
And walking back into the light
Until the sun set of your glory
Where my heart and future lies
There's nothing like that feeling
When I look into your eyes
My dreams came true
When I found you
I found you
My miracle
If you could see what I see
That you're the answer to my prays
And if you could feel the tenderness I feel
You would know it would be clear that angels brought me here
Brought me here
To be with you
I'll be forever grateful
Oh forever thankful
My dreams came true
When I found you
My miracle
Oh
If you could see what I see
That you're the answer to my prays
And if you could feel the tenderness I feel
You would know it would be clear that angels brought me here
If you could feel the tenderness I feel
You would know it would be clear that angels brought me here
