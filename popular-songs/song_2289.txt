Hello I'm paradise
Mr. Martian, sex on a satellite
What'cha know 'bout good weed and Gladis Knight
You won't wanna stop, no brakes, no hazard light
I satisfy, very accurately
I work in the satisfactory, the factory
How 'bout a dance and a Daiquiri
Then I gotta pin to the bed like we wrestling
I'm Weezy F baby boy
Comfortable like a lazy boy
And shawty soundin' like a tazer-boy
Make me drop to my knees and praise da' boy
I got the music on mellow
Champagne, hello
Make me wake up to make up on the pillow
Im her TV, Im her Weezy and all
[Omarion]
Ohhh, comfort, your, comfort, your
I will be your comfort, comfort, your, comfort,
your, comfort, comfort, comfort, comfort, comfort
You can call me
You can call me
[Lil Wayne]
See Im the rapper, and he's the dancer
and together we are
Your comfort
