Forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever
You could stop the clock
There wouldn't be time enough
You could let the night turn to morning
I still would be wantin' more of your love
It just ain't enough days in a week
Weeks in a month
Months in a year
How can I make it clear?
(I wanna be with you)
I wanna be with you
(And feel the heat with you)
And feel the heat with you
(I'm flying, I'm weightless)
I'm floatin' in the distance
(Don't rush it, be patient)
I'm gonna stop the hands of time, I will
Follow me, follow me
Follow me, follow me, follow me
If it feels like this it's gotta be right
Follow me, follow me
Follow me, follow me, follow me
Don't let it be over tonight, over tonight
Follow me, follow me
Follow me, follow me, follow me
If it feels like this it's gotta be right
Let's do it forever
We could do it forever
I could do this forever
I could do this forever
Forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever
Give me all your life
And I'd ask you for even more
You can't offer me a part of your body
'Cause honestly it's just not enough anymore
Let's get lost in the moment
You know you want it
What you waitin' for?
(I wanna be with you)
I wanna be with you
(And feel the heat with you)
And feel the heat with you
(I'm flying, I'm weightless)
I'm floatin' in the distance
(Don't rush it, be patient)
I'm gonna stop the hands of time, I will
Follow me, follow me
Follow me, follow me, follow me
If it feels like this it's gotta be right
Follow me, follow me
Follow me, follow me, follow me
Don't let it be over tonight, over tonight
Follow me, follow me
Follow me, follow me, follow me
If it feels like this it's gotta be right
Let's do it forever
We could do it forever
I could do this forever
I could do this forever
Forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever
Can you tell me what it is
You're waitin' for?
Can you tell me what it is
'Cause I don't know
(Let's go)
Come on baby just take my hand
(Let's go)
Why you lookin' like you don't understand?
(Let's go)
That's it, I'ma make this easy
(Let's go)
And that ain't me, believe me but just
Follow me, follow me
Follow me, follow me, follow me
If it feels like this it's gotta be right
Follow me, follow me
Follow me, follow me, follow me
Don't let it be over tonight, over tonight
Follow me, follow me
Follow me, follow me, follow me
If it feels like this it's gotta be right
Let's do it forever
We could do it forever
I could do this forever
I could do this forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
Let's go
  (Forever, forever, forever, forever)
Let's go
  (Forever, forever, forever, forever)
Let's go
  (Forever, forever, forever, forever)
Let's go
  (Forever, forever, forever, forever)
Let's go
