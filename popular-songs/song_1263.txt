What you want, baby, I got it, mmm
What you need, 'cause you know I got it
All I'm asking is for a little respect when you get home
Hey baby, when you get home, a-mister
Ain't gonna do you wrong while you're gone
Ain't gonna do you wrong 'cuz I don't wanna
And all I want you do for me is give it to me
When you get home, alright now
When you get home, alright
I'm about to give ya all of my money
And all I'm asking in return, honey
Is to give me my profits when you get home
Alright now, when you get home
Ooh , your kisses sweeter than honey
And guess what, so is my money
And all I want you do for me is give it to me when ya get home
Alright now, when ya get home
A little respect
