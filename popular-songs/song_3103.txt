It's summer
The heat is blazing 
Like The fourth of July
I got the air, come on
And it is blasting on high
So just grab something cool
And jump in your ride
Pick up everybody, I'll be waiting outside
Woah, woah
The summer's not hot without you
(I hope I get to see ya)
Woah, woah
The summer won't start without you
The temperature is 99
And it can get much higher
So come on over Romeo
And vamos a la playa
(go to the beach)
Woah, woah
The summer's not hot
The summers won't start without you 
The summers not hot
The summers not hot
Till you show up
The summers not hot
The summers not hot
The summers not hot 
Till you show up
It's summer
You're the reason
That I jumped in the pool
Cause your so hot that that I gotta get cooled off and  
All your friends 
Just bring them along
Hurry up and meet me
There's a party going on 
Woah, woah
The Summer's not hot without you
(hope I get to see ya)
Woah, woah
The summer's won start without you
The temperature is 99
And it can get much higher
So come on over Romeo
And vamos a la playa
(go to the beach)
Woah, woah
The summer's not hot
The summers won't start without you 
Till you show up 
Till you show up 
Till you show up
Till you show up
In my heart it is freezing
I am wearing a bikini and I know 
The sun is beating down
Wherever u may be   
But
The summers not hot to me
The summers not hot to me
The summers not hot to me
Till you show up
The summers not hot 
The summers not hot
The summers not hot
Till you show up
Woah, woah
Summer' not hot without you
(I hope I get to see ya)
Woah, woah
The summer wont start without you
The temperature is 99
And it can get much higher
So come on over Romeo
And vamos a la playa
(go to the beach)
Woah, woah
The summer's not hot 
The summer wont start without you
Not hot to me
No matter what the temperture is
The summer's not hot to me
Not hot to me
The summer's not hot 
The summer wont start without you
Not hot to me
No matter what the temperture is
The summer's not hot to me
Not hot to me
