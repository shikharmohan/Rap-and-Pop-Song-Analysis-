Did you check the tires, put gas in the car?
I don't think you'll need too much
'Cause you ain't gonna get that far
Did you pack the good times?
Don't forget a map, just in case the route
You take isn't there to take you back
You can hold any girl that you like
Fall in love when it's easy at night
But you wake up wondering why
She ain't ever something better
When you're lost and you've run out of road
Find what I already know
In the end close is all there is
But you won't find this
No, you won't find this
There's once in a lifetime
And there's once in a while
And the difference between the two
Is about a million miles
Oh, you might get lucky
While the moon is looking on
But in the truth of the morning
The stars will be long gone
You can hold any girl that you like
Fall in love when it's easy at night
But you wake up wondering why
She ain't ever something better
When you're lost and you've run out of road
Find what I already know
In the end close is all there is
But you won't find this
No, you won't find this
You can hold any girl that you like
Fall in love when it's easy at night
But you wake up wondering why
She ain't ever something better
When you're lost and you've run out of road
Find what I already know
In the end close is all there is
Oh, in the end it's me you're gonna miss
'Cause you won't find this
Oh, you won't find this
