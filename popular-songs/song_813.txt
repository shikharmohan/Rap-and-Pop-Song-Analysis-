We danced and sang somewhere in between heaven and hell
Gabrielle, that was her name
Everyone was smiling even through their tears under her spell
But in Gabrielle's eyes nothing
I asked do you not like the music?
She said it's alright
But she dances to her own side, so she says
Take me away from here
Take me somewhere where love is like breathing
I don't care where we go long as I'm there with you baby
Long as I'm there with you
I could tell she's been through pain I could only dream
Nightmares live where you live
Tears well in her eyes but she wouldn't let them fall
I'd give the world to know what her smile is
I asked do you dance with me now?
Let me try to figure out
The fastest route out of town and she says
Take me away from here
Take me somewhere where love is like breathing
I don't care where we go long as I'm there with you baby
I got a full tank of gas girl
Anywhere you wanna go girl
All you have to do is ask girl, oh she said
Take me away from here
Take me somewhere where love is like breathing
I don't care where we go long as I'm there with you baby
Come on and take me away from you
Take me somewhere where love is like breathing
I don't care where we go long as I'm there with you
