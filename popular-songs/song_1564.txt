So what you see is only half the story
There's another side of me
I'm the girl you know, but I'm someone else, too
If only you knew
It's a crazy life
But I'm alright
I've got everything I've always wanted
I'm living the dream
So, yeah, everything I've always wanted
Is it always what it seems?
I'm a lucky girl
Whose dreams came true
But underneath it all
I'm just like you
Don't wanna be treated differently
I wanna keep it all inside
Half the time I've got my name in lights
The other half I'm by your side
It's a crazy life but I'm just fine
I've got everything I've always wanted
I'm living the dream
So yeah everything I've always wanted
Is it always what it seems?
I'm a lucky girl
Whose dreams came true
But underneath it all
I'm just like you
Yeah, yeah
Can't you see I'm just an ordinary girl?
Living in an extraordinary world
Trying to live, trying to learn
Trying to just be who I am
Who I am
I've got everything I've always wanted
I'm living the dream
So yeah everything I've always wanted
Is it always what it seems?
I'm a lucky girl
Whose dreams came true
But underneath it all
I'm just like you
I've got everything I've always wanted
I'm living the dream
So yeah everything I've always wanted
Is it always what it seems?
I'm a lucky girl
Whose dreams came true
But underneath it all
I'm just like you
