Good morning beautiful
How was your night
Mine was wonderful
With you by my side
And when I open my eyes
And see your sweet face
It's a good morning beautiful day 
I couldn't see the light
I didn't know day from night
I had no reason to care
But since you came along
I can face the dawn
Cause I know you'll be there 
Good morning beautiful
How was your night
Mine was wonderful
With you by my side
And when I open my eyes
And see your sweet face
It's a good morning beautiful day 
I'll never worry
If it's raining outside
Cause in here with you girl
The sun always shines 
Good morning beautiful
How was your night
Mine was wonderful
With you by my side
And when I open my eyes
And see your sweet face
It's a good morning beautiful day, yeah 
A good morning beautiful...day 
Good morning beautiful
A beautiful day
Good morning beautiful 
Good morning beautiful
A beautiful day
Good morning beautiful day
A beautiful day
Good morning beautiful
