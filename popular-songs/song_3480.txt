You never looked so good as you did last night
Underneath the city lights
There walking with your friend, laughing at the moon
I swear you looked right through me
But I'm still livin' with your goodbye
And you're just goin' on with your life
How can you just walk on by without one tear in your eye?
Don't you have the slightest feelings left for me?
Maybe that's just your way of dealing with the pain
Forgetting everything between our rise and fall
Like we never loved at all
You, I hear you're doin' fine
Seems like you're doin' well as far as I can tell
Time is leaving us behind
Another week has passed and still I haven't laughed yet
So tell me what your secret is baby, yeah?
To letting go, letting go like you did, like you did
How can you just walk on by without one tear in your eye?
Don't you have the slightest feelings left for me?
Maybe that's just your way of dealing with the pain
Forgetting everything between our rise and fall
Like we never loved at all
Did you forget the magic?
Did you forget the passion?
And did you ever miss me?
Ever long to kiss me?
Maybe that's just your way of dealing with the pain
Forgetting everything between our rise and fall
Like we never loved at all
