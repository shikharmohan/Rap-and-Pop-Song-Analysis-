Girl I caught you in your little white lie
Red handed, red handed
You said you had to work tonight
But here you are dancin', slow dancin'
In this honky tonk with someone else
And all you got to say for yourself is so so?
I'm sorry, so?
So, so long bye bye baby
I'll catch you on the flip side maybe, don't you
Slip slide on a tear when you find me gone
Go, go on, cry crybaby
Those tears are gonna drip drop maybe
But you're gonna miss my good love baby
For so so long, so so long
Let me buy you a goodbye drink
Make it a double, a double
'Cause I've seen everything I need to see
You're nothin' but trouble, big trouble
And one other thing before I go
I wanna tell you that I think you're so, so, so
Aw, I ain't gonna sink that low
So, so long bye bye baby
I'll catch you on the flip side maybe, don't you
Slip slide on a tear when you find me gone
Go, go on, cry crybaby
Those tears are gonna drip drop maybe
But you're gonna miss my good love baby
For so so long, so so long
I bet you think I'm gonna let it slide
The way you're flashin' me those puppy dog eyes
Right? Yeah, right
Right? Wrong
So, so long, bye bye baby
I'll catch you on the flip side maybe, don't you
Slip slide on a tear when you find me gone, long gone
G-g-go on, cry crybaby
Those tears are gonna drip drop maybe
But you're gonna miss my good love baby
For so so long
For so so long, so so long
See ya
