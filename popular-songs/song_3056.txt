Ever try to reach for something
But it's someone else's dream?
Every step that you take forward
It takes you right back where you been
And then when you least expect it
And you've tried about everything
Somebody hears your opinions
Somebody cares what you see
You woke me up
No longer tired
With you I feel inspired
You help me find my fire
You're the new classic
You're the new PYT
Stands for paid, young and
Taking on the world from the driver's seat
You look so classic, fantastic
When you're on that floor
Bring the beat back once more
Let me see you do that
Oh trying to do it right
No rehearsals
It's your life
If you're doing this crazy dance
Cause your making these crazy plans
It's just this is not a test
You put in work to be the best
It's a classic take
On a brand new game
Before the needle drops
They're gonna know your name
When it gets old don't lose the light
You're cold, I'll warm you up
Your fire is hot enough, enough, enough
You're the new classic
You're the new PYT
Stands for paid, young and
Trying everything just to touch your dreams
You look so classic, fantastic
Oh when you're on that floor
Bring the beat back once more
Let me see you do that
It's become so hard
For me to be surprised
You're bringing back the real me
No judgment in your eyes
Cause when I dance with you
It's how I speak the truth
Just classic when we met
Now you make me new
You're the new classic
You're the new PYT
Stands for paid, young and
Taking on the world from the driver's seat
You look so classic, fantastic
When you on that floor
Bring the beat back once more
(Bring the beat back once more)
You're the new classic
You're the new PYT
Stands for paid, young and
Taking on the world from the driver's seat
You look so classic, fantastic
When you're on that floor
Bring the beat back once more
Bring it back, bring it back
Let me see you do that
You're the new classic
You're the new PYT
Stands for paid, young and
Taking on the world from the driver's seat
You're the new classic, fantastic
When you're on that floor
Bring the beat back once more
Let me see you do that
