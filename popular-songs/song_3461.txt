Baby I Think We Both Know It's Gone Wrong, Wrong, Wrong
And I Know You Don't Think We Can Carry It On
Baby I Think We Both Know It's Gone Bad, Bad, Bad
Think Of All The Good Times We Had
Driving To Your House
Member When We First Met
Dancin' On A Friday Night
Under The Moon Light
Talkin' Till The Night Was Gone
In The Back Of My Truck With The Radio On
Then That Ol' Song Comes On
Together We're Singin'
Forever We're Singin'
When That Ol' Song Comes On
Together We're Singin'
Forever We're Singin'
That Ol' Country Song
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Baby I Think We Both Know
It's Alright, Alright
But How Could I Forget What You Did That Night
Baby You Told Me You Loved Me In Tennessee
Where We Were Gonna Live
But Now You've Done A Few Things That I Can't Forgive
Driving To Her House
Tellin' Her You Love Her
Lying On A Friday Night
Ring In Your Pocket
Lying To Me All Along
In The Back Of Your Truck With The Radio On
Then That Ol' Song Comes On
Together We're Singin'
Forever We're Singin'
I Know We Went Wrong
But We Belong
Together We're Singin'
Forever We're Singin'
That Ol' Country Song
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Then That Ol Song Comes On
Together We're Singin'
Forever We're Singin'
I Know We Went Wrong
But We Belong
Together We're Singin'
Forever We're Singin'
That Ol Country Song
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
