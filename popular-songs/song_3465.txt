I remember Sunday mornings
Walking on the beach
And that place we'd stop for breakfast
With the old, red vinyl seats
The hours of the tide chart
The way the sunlight danced upon your face
That antique roller coaster
You just had to ride
I remember how you laughed
At the terror in my eyes
The color and the detail
Just like it was yesterday
And I remember how you held me
The night my father died
I didn't have to tell you
I just broke down and cried
You're sewn into the fabric
The pieces of my life
And I just can't remember
Why we said goodbye
Up and down this boardwalk
Lonely people sit
I know, it wasn't perfect
But nothin' ever is
The sails out in the harbor
Are searching for the wind
I just had to call you
I had to hear your voice
And tell you, I still love you
We still have a choice
You're sewn into the fabric
The pieces of my life
And I just can't remember
Why we said goodbye
Everything I do, leads me back to you
I know, I just can't let us go
Must have been a reason
But I can't remember now
I know, if I could hold you
We could work it out
You're sewn into the fabric
The pieces of my life
And girl, let's give it one more try
'Cause I just can't remember
Why we said goodbye
