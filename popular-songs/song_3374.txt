Yeah, I swore off love, I swore off women
Devoted my life to huntin' and fishin'
I'd never be anybody else's lovesick fool
It ain't cool
I spend all my spare time fixin' up
That old rusted up pick-up truck
In no time at all, I'd have it
Lookin' like brand new, then you
Flipped the switch on my dumaflachi
Played my piano like Liberace
I let down my guard
And my heart was good as gone, so long
Yeah, you cranked my tractor, you flicked my bic
Woman, you trip the trigger on my thing-a-majig
Can't explain how you've done it
But, honey, you turn me on
You look at all the takin', I done all the givin'
I threw up my hands, said, "The heck with it"
I shut down my heart, locked it up and pulled the fuse
Before it blew
All my emotions were disconnected
No sign of a spark could be detected
I had nobody so I had nothing to lose
Then you
Flipped the switch on my dumaflachi
Played my piano like Liberace
I let down my guard
And my heart was good as gone, so long
Yeah, you cranked my tractor, you flicked my bic
Woman, you trip the trigger on my thing-a-majig
Can't explain how you've done it
But, honey, you turn me on
Yeah, you crank my tractor, you flick my bic
Woman you trip the trigger on my thing-a-majig
Can't explain how you've done it
But, honey, you turn me on
I can't handle that, baby
You better slow down
