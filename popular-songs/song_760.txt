Thought you were my star
Thought you were the moon
But since you come down here
I sit so confused
What more can I do
Too speechless to say
They told me that love would 
never feel this way
See down in my heart
I gave it a hunet and one percent all the time
Thinking that I 
Could live out these eh-ep-si-si- isodes
No reruns suppose
But then I lied and we stayed in rewind
And Now I'm broken down 
Now I'm broken x3
Can't say I was blind
I seen this before
For your full attention
It seems I'm at war
Consistently more
There's no more to prove
This treasure hunts over
I found all the clues
See down in my heart
I gave it a hunet and one percent all the time
Thinking that I 
Could live out these eh-ep-si-si- isodes
No reruns suppose
But then I lied this heck is divine
And now I'm broken down
Now I'm broken downx4
U make it hard to hold u down, down
But still make it hard to do without, out
How do u live with your mistakes, stakes
But then again
Why do 
I stay
Yeah
