I'm dreaming tonight of the place I love
Even more than I usually do
And although I know it's a long road back
This I promise you
One, two
Well, I'll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
So please, have snow and lots of mistletoe
And presents under the tree
Oh! Christmas EWve will find me
Where the love life is
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
You know Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love life is
Darling, I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
Oh! If only in my dreams
