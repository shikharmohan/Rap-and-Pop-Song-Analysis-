Yeah
I'm on my way home
They say home is where the hate is, my dome is where fate is
I stroll where souls get lost like Vegas
Seen through the eyes of rebel glasses
Pray to God that my arms reach the masses
The young smoke grass in grassless jungles
Rubberband together in cashless bundles
We wear strugglin' chains, divided only hustle remains
Makin' sense of it we hustle for change
Revolution ain't a game, it's another name for life fightin'
Someone to stay in their corner like Mike Tyson
Heights fightin' for hits to heighten they hell
Don't he know he could only get as high as he fell
Show money becomes bail, relationships become jail
Children are unhailed
I wish love was for sale, behold the pale
Horse got me trapped like R. Kel', I bail and it
Might not be such a bad idea if I never
Never went home again
I'm on my way home, I left three days ago
But no one seems to know I'm gone
Home is where the hatred is
Home is filled with pain and it
Might not be such a bad idea if I never
Never went home again
