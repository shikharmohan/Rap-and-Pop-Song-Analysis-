She wants her nails painted black
She wants the toy in the Cracker Jack
She wants to ride the bull at the rodeo
She wants to wear my shirt to bed
She wants to make every stray a pet
And drive around in my truck with no place to go
But she needs to feel that fire
The one that lets her know for sure
She's everything I want and more
Her real desire
Is to know I'd walk alone out on the wire
To make her feel that fire
She wants a cabin in the woods
She wants to stand where nobody stood
And someday she wants a couple kids of her own
She wants to make love on a train
Some days she only wants a break
Hey she wants what she wants
But man I know, I know, I know
But she needs to feel that fire
The one that lets her know for sure
She's everything I want and more
Her real desire
Is to know I'd walk alone out on the wire
To make her feel that fire, yeah, feel that fire
So as long as there's a breath to take
A smile to share, a prayer to pray
A chance to hold her hand to fan the flame!
She's gonna feel that fire
The one that lets her know for sure
She's everything I want and more
Her real desire
Is to know I'd walk alone out on the wire
Yeah, to make her feel that fire, oh, feel that fire
She wants her nails painted black
She wants the toy in the Cracker Jack
She wants to ride the bull at the rodeo
