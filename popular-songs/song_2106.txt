Time stood still the other dayÃÂ 
Just stopped cuz of the wayÃÂ 
That he kissed meÃÂ 
The day shared the sky with the nightÃÂ 
Both Sunshine and MoonlightÃÂ 
Cause he kissed meÃÂ 
And the waters all sit still in the oceanÃÂ 
And the birds that fly above just froze in the air
Froze in the airÃÂ 
(Chorus)ÃÂ 
When he kissed me (x2)ÃÂ 
I closed my eyes and died a littleÃÂ 
Opened them and cried a littleÃÂ 
When he kissed me (x2)ÃÂ 
It was everything I thought that it would beÃÂ 
When he kissed meÃÂ 
She said through the tears that she criedÃÂ 
That she knew how I felt insideÃÂ 
When he kissed meÃÂ 
And I saw pain behind her eyesÃÂ 
Just couldn't figure whyÃÂ 
It was a mysteryÃÂ 
She said, "I bet the waters all sit still in the oceanÃÂ 
And all the birds just frozeÃÂ 
Is that how it goes?"ÃÂ 
(So I asked her)ÃÂ 
"How do you know?"ÃÂ 
She saidÃÂ 
"Cuz he kissed me
Yes, he kissed me"
She said she closed her eyes and died a little
Opened them and cried a little
When he kissed me
When he kissed me
She said it was everything she thought that it would be, mmm
(Original chorus 1x)
