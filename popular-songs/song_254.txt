I don't need me a basketball player
All I need is somebody that's down for me
And he don't have to have money
His love is just like honey
It's so sweet to me
He can have everythin' in this world
But he'll sacrifice it all for me
And I made up my mind
I'm in love this time
And it feels so real
And I know that he won't break my heart
And I know that we won't ever part
It's time, time for us to settle down
And I wanna be with him forever
They can't say that I am crazy
For makin' him my baby
Bought his flowers for me
See I've done been through many changes
But this one I ain't changin'
This one's staying the same
I can have everythin' in this world
But I'll sacrifice it all for him
And I made up my mind
I'm in love this time
And it feels so real
And I know that he won't break my heart
And I know that we won't ever part
And it's time, time for us to settle down
And I wanna be with him forever
I Love you
And all of the things that you do
Oh baby please, I need you
So believe me, I do
'Cause I love you
And every little thing baby, you do
They don't know how I feel
'Cause I know this is real
And I know that he won't break my heart
And I know that we won't ever part
And it's time, time for us to settle down
And I wanna be with him forever
And I know that he won't break my heart
And I know that we won't ever part
And it's time, time for us to settle down
And I wanna be with him forever
