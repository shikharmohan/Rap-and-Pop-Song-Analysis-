Reba:
When you just give love
Natalie:
And never get love
Reba:
You better let love be part
Natalie:
I know that it's so
And yeah I know
Reba:
I can't get you out of my heart
Natalie:
You, you, you, you, you, you
You make me leave my happy home
You took my love and now you're gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
Since I fell for you
Oh yeah
Reba:
Oh love
Natalie:
(sing reba)
Reba:
Brings such misery and pain
I guess I'll never
Oh I guess I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you
Natalie:
(I gotta say this right here)
Well, well it's too bad
Reba:

Reba:
Oh it's too sad
Natalie:
But I'm in love, I'm in love with you
Natalie:

Natalie:

Reba:

Natalie:
Oh but what can I do
I'm still in love with you
Reba:
I, I guess I'll never see the light
Natalie:
Never gonna see the light

Since I fell for you

Oh come on come on come on tell them about it
Reba:
Oh it's too bad
Natalie:
