Portray sincerity, act out all the loyalty
Defend your free country, wish away pain
Hand out lobotomies to save little families
Surrealistic fantasies, bland boring plain
All we know is restitution
Living out your date with fusion
Is the whole fleece shun in bastard
Don't feel guilty masturbating
Somebody said that they're not much like I am
I know, I can
Make enough of the words, you go along
And sing your song
Slippery pessimist hypocrite master
Conservative communist apocalyptic bastard
Thank you dear God for putting me on this earth
I feel very privileged in debt for my thirst
All we know is restitution
Living out your date with fusion
Is the whole fleece shun in bastard
Don't feel guilty masturbating
Somebody said that they're not much like I am
I know, I can
Make enough of the words, you go along
And sing your song
Downer
