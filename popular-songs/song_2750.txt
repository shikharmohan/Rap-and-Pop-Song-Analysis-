Better hang on to that matchbook with his number on it
But not for the reason you think
There'll come a day girl that you're gonna want it
To light the past up in flames
He's the lesson you learn
He's the dead end you see when you realize you made a wrong turn
He's that one last look back when you finally get over the hurt
He's the bridge you burn
He's the bridge you burn
No you're not the first one to think they can change him
Well that line of fools is so long
But you'll be the only one you have to blame when
You wake up and he's gone
He's the lesson you learn
He's the dead end you see when you realize you made a wrong turn
He's that one last look back when you finally get over the hurt
He's the bridge you burn, burn down
Then you turn around and say
Man that was a close one
He's the lesson you learn
He's the dead end you see when you realize you made a wrong turn
He's the lesson you learn
He's that one last look back when you get over the hurt
He's the bridge you burn
He's the bridge you burn
Yeah he's the bridge you burn
He's the bridge you burn
Burn it down girl
