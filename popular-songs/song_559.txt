They say anythings possible,
you gotta dream like you never seen obstacles
chasing obscene profits so we ain't stopping for the red lights
look in my rear view all I see is n-ggas headlights
catch me if you can hoe
they try and sack me and I scramble
look up in the sky you'll see exactly where I am bo

making my wishes come true with no genie man
I got the keys to my beamer with no Beanie Man
I'm on these rich n-ggas ass no bikini man
I bring the real to the day the Lord free me man
never imagined that the kids would wanna be me man
eh, could it be that I give the hopeless broke kids, hope
