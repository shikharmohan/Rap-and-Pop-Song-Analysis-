That first kiss shook me up
It rattled my cage with a tender touch
Sweet and wild
Girl, I could not get enough
The grass was cool, we lost our minds
Sharing secrets and a bottle of wine
Lazy night, cotton dress
Giving into a warm caress
Sweet and wild
Girl, I could not get enough
Sweet and wild
The taste of your love
The taste of your love
Gentle on my mind
Taste of your love
Sweet and wild as berries
From the summer vine
I know the stars, saw the spark
Hopes and dreams tangled in the dark
Sweet and wild
The taste of your love
Yeah, the taste of your love
Gentle on my mind
Taste of your love
Sweet and wild as berries
From the summer vine
Every breath fanned the flame
Your warm body drove me insane
And though it's been years and miles
I see that fire flicker in your smile
Sweet and wild
Girl, I still can't get enough
Sweet and wild
Boy, I still can't get enough
Sweet and wild
The taste of your love
Yeah, ooh, sweet and wild, oh yeah
Yeah, ooh, yeah, sweet and wild
The taste of your love
Yeah, ooh, sweet and wild, yeah, yeah, yeah
