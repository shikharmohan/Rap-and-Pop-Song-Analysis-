I can tell by the way you feel,
Somethin' ain't goin your way
Jeans too tight and your hair ain't right,
We all get some of those days
Ohh, throw that mirror away
Ohh, you know it's gunna be okay
Take it down, shake it out,
On the floor
You'll get over it,
Let it drop, make it stop,
Ohh
When you feel like nothing
Everybodys something       
You and your friend
Everybody jump in, look at us now
Everybody shout out, Ohh
In the spotlight,
No matter what's on the outside,
Get it with your inside
Open your eyes, you deserve a  spotlight
Don't be from them, everybodys something, ohh
Ohh, In the spotlight (x4)
Gettin' up, all in my face
Wish I could press delete,
We all got something we don't like,
Even Angelina Jolie,
Ohh, throw away that mirror
Ohh, don't be goin' M.I.A
Take it down, shake it out
On the floor
You'll get over it,
Let it drop, make it stop,
Ohh
When you feel like nothing
Everybodys something
You and your friend
Everybody jump in, look at us now
Everybody shout out, Ohh
In the spotlight,
No matter what's on the outside,
Get it with your inside
Open your eyes, you deserve a spotlight
Don't be from them, everybodys something, ohh
Ohh, In the spotlight (x4)
I can tell by the way you talk the talk,
That somethin' ain't goin' your way
'Cause your jeans too tight and your hair ain't right
Well we all get some of those days,
Just take another deep breath, try to hit your reset
You know that I can relate
Put your hands in the air,
Now let me hear you shout out,
We'll get out of my way
Take it down, shake it out
On the floor
You'll get over it,
Let it drop, make it stop,
Ohh
When you feel like nothing
Everybodys something'
You and your friend
Everybody jump in, look at us now
Everybody shout out, Ohh
In the spotlight,
No matter what's on the outside,
Get it with your inside
Open your eyes, you deserve a spotlight
Don't be from them, everybody something, ohh
When you feel like nothing
Everybodys something
You and your friend
Everybody jump in, look at us now
Everybody shout out, Ohh
In the spotlight,
No matter what's on the outside,
Get it with your inside
Open your eyes, you deserve a spotlight
Don't be from them, everybodys something, ohh
Ohh, In the spotlight (x4)
