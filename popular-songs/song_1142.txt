So much for never makin' the same mistake
I can't believe I'm here again
So much for ever thinkin' that I could change
My good intentions still remain in chains
She's gotta be over me now
Probably moved on with her life
Found someone she knows she can believe
God, I would give anything, if I could just go back again
And be the man she needed me to be
I thought I was a hero, I played him well
He saves the day but not himself
And I acted out the lover, my finest part
Had all the lines but not the heart
Now look where we are
She's gotta be over me now
Probably moved on with her life
Found someone she knows she can believe
God, I would give anything, if I could just go back again
And be the man she needed me to be
Be the man that she could trust
Be the man who put her first
Be the man who tamed his demons
Who healed her hurts
Be the man in health and sickness
Be the man who helped her grow
Be the man with no resentment
True repentance, God as my witness
Oh! She's gotta be over me now
Probably moved on with her life
Found someone she knows she can believe
God, I would give anything, if I could just go back again
And be the man she needed me to be
She's gonna be over me now
Probably moved on with her life
Found someone she knows she can believe
God, I would give anything, if I could just go back again
And be the man she needed me, she needed me to be
She needed me to be
Hallelu
Yeah, I could be that man
She needed me, she needed me to be
That man
She needed me, she needed me to be
Oh, that man to be
