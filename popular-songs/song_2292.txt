You know sometimes you get in situations
And when you make that move
You gotta be committed
She know what I mean
We were better off friends
But the magic of the night had us holding each other tight
We should've kept it right there
But the movie got boring and you wore those jeans I like
I glanced at your pretty feet
Your sexy hands rubbing on my chest
Should I kiss you? I heard a voice say yes
Next, we were undressing not realizing
We shouldn't be doing this, no
What are we doing
What have we done, what have we ruined?
How did this happen
Were we just blacked out, what are we doing?
What are we doing
What have we done? Baby, I'm tripping
'Cause after we cut all the feeling was gone
Girl, what did we do?
They say some things are better off as just a fantasy
What came over me?
I did not lose control, it must've been those jeans
It was the way she fit in those jeans
I can't even remember if it was good or not
All I know is that our temperature was boiling hot
Can't believe I just made love to my dear friend
I pray that this isn't damaging in the end
Lack of communication
Got us both in the situation
Now there's no way out, no way out
'Cause we can't turn back time, no
What are we doing
What have we done, what have we ruined?
How did this happen
Were we just blacked out, what are we doing?
What are we doing
What have we done? Baby, I'm tripping
'Cause after we cut all the feeling was gone
Girl, what did we do?
We're staring at the ceiling
With the cover tuck pulled up to our necks
Like o
Should've never let you come here alone, no, no, no
I know I just enjoy seeing you naked
Now I can't look, now I can't look
We did this, it's a price we have to pay
Now there's nothing to say
She was a friend of mine fine, slim waistline
I never thought she'd be feeling me, never seen the sign
My homie said I'll eventually hit it a while back
I told him na, she friend, it ain't like that
I found myself staring at that ass a couple times
Threw without a sight in mind, knowing her since I was nine
But a moment alone in a soft bed changed everything
Never thought that we go to this extreme
Lack of communication
Got us both in the situation
Now there's no way out, no way out
We can't turn back time, no
What are we doing
What have we done, what have we ruined?
How did this happen
Were we just blacked out, what are we doing?
What are we doing
What have we done? Baby, I'm tripping
'Cause after we cut all the feeling was gone
Girl, what did we do?
What are we doing
What have we done, what have we ruined?
How did this happen
Were we just blacked out, what are we doing?
Are we doing
What have we done? Baby, I'm tripping
'Cause after we cut all the feeling was gone
Girl, what did we do?
