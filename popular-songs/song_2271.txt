She seems to think, she seems too weak
She takes a week to get over it
She likes the sea, she likes to see
She likes to think she has all of it
She likes the sound, she likes the sand
She likes to stand, she can't afford to sit
She likes to be, she likes to be
She likes to be, she's into guilt, guilt, guilt, guilt
She likes to think, she likes to drink
She seems too weak, she takes all the rent
She likes the time, she owns the time
She borrows time to self-invent
She seems too weak, she likes to see
She likes to think she has all the rent
She likes the sand, she likes to stand
She likes to sit, she likes to go, go, go, go
She seems to think, she seems too weak
She takes a week to get over it
She likes the sea, she likes to see
She likes to think she has all the rent
She likes to stand, she likes the sand
She likes to stand, she can't afford to sit
She likes to be, she likes to be
She likes to be, she likes to go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go!
