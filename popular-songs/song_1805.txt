Don't let no small frustration
Ever bring you down
No, no, no, no
Just take a situation
And turn it all around
With a new attitude everything can change
Make it how you want it to be
Stay mad, why do that? Give yourself a break
Laugh about it and you'll see
Life's what you make it
So let's make it rock
Life's what you make it
So come on, come on, come on, everybody now
Why be sad broken hearted?
There's so much to do
Life is hard or it's a party
The choice is up to you
With a new attitude everything can change
Make it how you want it to be
Stay sad, why do that? Give yourself a break
I know you want to party with me
Life's what you make it
So let's make it rock
Life's what you make it
So come on, come on, come on, everybody now
Let's celebrate it, join in everyone
You decide 'cause life's what you make it
Things are looking up anytime you want
All you gotta do is realize that
It's under your control
So let the good times rock and roll!
C'mon everybody
Do it now
All right, let's get the party started
Yeah, yeah, yeah, now that's a party
Yeah, yeah, put your hands together
Life's what you make it
So let's make it rock, let's make it rock
Life's what you make it
So come on, come on, come on, everybody now
Let's celebrate it, join in everyone
You decide 'cause life's what you make it, aww yeah
Life is what you make it
