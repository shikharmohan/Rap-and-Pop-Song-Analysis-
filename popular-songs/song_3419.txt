I'm so glad that I met you, baby
I'm so proud when we walk in the room
I know it's crazy to worry like I do
I get this feelin' that I'm losing you
I get these suspicions
Even though I know that you love me, baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way
Ooh, suspicions, I can't help
But you're just so good lookin'
I'm afraid somebody's gonna
Steal you away from me
When I go out to a party with you
You always turn every head in the room
I just know what's on every man's mind
I try to fight it but it gets me sometimes
I get these suspicions
Even though I know that you love me, baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way
Ooh, suspicions, I can't help
But you're just so good lookin'
I'm afraid somebody's gonna
Steal you away from me, oh baby, oh darlin'
And when I'm with you, I feel so satisfied
The way you touch me when you lay by my side
That look in your eyes when we make love
Makes me hate myself for what I'm thinkin' of
I get these suspicions
Even though I know that you love me, baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way
Ooh, suspicions, I can't help
But you're just so good lookin'
I'm afraid somebody's gonna
Steal you away from me
Ooh suspicions
Even though I know that you love me, baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way
Ooh, suspicions, I can't help
But you're just so good lookin'
I'm afraid somebody's gonna
Steal you away from me
Ooh, suspicions
Oh baby, oh darlin'
Ooh, suspicions
'Cause I love her 'cause I love her
I love her and she loves me
Ooh, suspicions
Ain't nobody gonna take my girl from me
Ooh, suspicions
Ooh, suspicions
Ooh, suspicions
Ooh, suspicions
