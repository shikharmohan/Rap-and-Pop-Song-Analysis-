I just wanna be
I just wanna be
Takin' away the fact that I care about you
It's just your way, so sweet
Everything seems right around you
Did you know that you
Had this common way about you when you touch
And I wanna know if I could be your girl
You're everything, and everything is you
You're everything, and everything is you
You're everything, and everything is you
You're everything, and everything is you
I'm happy to say in a lot of ways
You've changed me, makes me smile when you said
You were glad the day you found me
I'm wishin' away any hope that I might ever find you
Heaven knows
I really feel I'll always be your girl
You're everything, and everything is you
You're everything, and everything is you
You're everything, and everything is you
You're everything, and everything is you
The one who puts her arms around you
The one who lays her head beside you
The one who listens when you need it
When no one else is I just is
The one who knows when some thing's wrong
The one who knows your favorite song
The one who all your friends love
And your personal one to hug
You're everything, and everything is you
You're everything, and everything is you
You're everything, and everything is you
You're everything, and everything is you
The one to turn to you, and down for you
The one who makes you smile and laughs with you
The one to hold you down, I'm there for you
The one, the one, the one
The one to turn to you and down for you
The one who makes you smile and laughs with you
The one to hold you down I'm there for you
The one, the one, the one
The one to turn to you and down for you
The one who makes you smile and laughs with you
The one to hold you down, I'm there for you
The one, the one, the one
The one who turns to you
The one who makes you smile
The one who holds you down
The one, the one, the one
The one who turns to you
The one who makes you smile
The one who holds you down
The one, the one, the one
I can be anything you need
