Raindrops, raindrops keep fallin'
Let me get them oh's, them ah's, them oh's, them ah's
Them oh's, them ah's, them oh's, them ah's
Let me get them oh's, them ah's
Them oh's, them ah's, them oh's, them ah's
Then we wake up in the morning, we can do it again
Lights out, you 'bout to get it
Salute me, I'm your lieutenant
Baby girl you better stop makin' this here an obstacle
'Cause I got the artillery, I'll just lock and load
Look at them lips, I gotta kiss 'em
You blow kush, come hit the swisher
'Cause I'm gonna take you higher than Mars and Jupiter
Then we'll make love in the clouds and fall right down to the Earth
And we'll make raindrops, ooh
Raindrops fallin' on our heads
Raindrops, ooh raindrops
Let me get them oh's, them ah's, them oh's, them ah's
Them oh's, them ah's, them oh's, them ah's
Let me get them oh's, them ah's
Them oh's, them ah's, them oh's, them ah's
Then we wake up in the morning, we can do it again
Round 2, no hesitation
'Cause once I'm up there's more precipitation
Shorty I can take it slow then I might just hit the gas
It's so wet on this trip that I might just slip and crash
You at my show, you feel it's magic
Who said tricks are for kids? That silly rabbit
So I'ma hop right on in it then I'ma climb on out
If I stay in it too long then we'll form a thunder cloud
Just be raindrops, ooh
Raindrops fallin' on our heads
Raindrops, ooh raindrops
Let me get them oh's, them ah's, them oh's, them ah's
Them oh's, them ah's, them oh's, them ah's
Let me get them oh's, them ah's
Them oh's, them ah's, them oh's, them ah's
Then we wake up in the morning, we can do it again
Come on, is it the attraction could I blame?
Infact she still remains my heart, will it be pain free?
Since I ain't been back up in the game I've been stackin' up my change
Relaxin' with my main squeeze
At ease 'cause she's my heart
So yeah, it stop beatin' if we's apart
Who you know up in the streets spit easy bars
Or who even let you get the keys with the Visa cards
Just me but only 'cause you the greatest
And I got more chips then Vegas
Plus I got more whips than Avis
Marianna, Jeremih's on the playlist
With them sexy lips to her fragrance
And them curvish hips, how could you blame him?
A queen gotta be crowned
So like I ain't 'cause you know I'm goin' hold you down
As long as we make them raindrops, ooh
Raindrops fallin' on our heads
Raindrops, ooh raindrops
Let me get them oh's, them ah's, them oh's, them ah's
Them oh's, them ah's, them oh's, them ah's
Let me get them oh's, them ah's
Them oh's, them ah's, them oh's, them ah's
Then we wake up in the morning, we can do it again
Raindrops, raindrops keep fallin'
