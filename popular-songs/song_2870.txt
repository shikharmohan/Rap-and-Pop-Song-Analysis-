Red sun arising over the hill
I've had enough of this desert to last from now until
I'm tired of living day to day and hand to mouth
This could be the day I finally find my way out
I'm gonna climb that mountain high
I'm gonna see what's on the other side
I'm gonna kiss this town good-bye
I'm gonna climb that mountain
How I arrived here, oh, heaven only knows
It seems more like the kind of place the devil would've chose
To spend my life here is more than I can do
I know somewhere down the road my dreams will come true
I'm gonna climb that mountain high
I'm gonna see what's on the other side
And I'm gonna kiss this town good-bye
I'm gonna climb that mountain
Oh, if I stay here forever
What will I have to show
But if I make it over
Well, then everyone will know
I'm gonna climb that mountain high
I'm gonna climb that mountain high
I'm gonna see what's on the other side
I'm gonna kiss this town good-bye
I'm gonna climb that mountain
I'm gonna climb that mountain high
I'm gonna climb that mountain
I'm gonna climb that mountain high
