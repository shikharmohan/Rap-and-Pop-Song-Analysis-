Im theatre of the hood when its lights cameras faction
Niggas gon be niggas when its fights and its faction
I walk up to the bar smellin like the kenneth reaction
Niggas reactin, like you must be outta the slacks
When im un-dressed, i con-fess i act a foolery
A pocket full of duckets, buku, bitchs and jewelry
Im buyin out the bar like my name was Anhiser Brewery
And hittin busch rider deuce like jesus created two of me
Haters they make me famous so i'm deservin' an oscar
Walkin my niggas notice my swagger disturbin there posture
But i dont never pranks bein gangsta, got a steady aim
Cus the K will make feel more hits then teady pain
So i dont have to tease about the way im makin cheese
I know you hateys wanna see (cant tell)
But it would never eva happen cus im infinetly rappin
At the bar, they wonder-ing will i quit
I Simply say....

Crown royal on the rocks serve it in ya biggest pitcha
Rock it cocktail paper, if i look to high to talk to women
Just wanna get em drunk, shut em up then get up in em
She tipsy off six shots, shes feelin my rick ross
She wanna lick a rapper, One wit a big boss
Push it to the limit, everday is anotha party
Pinnapple mali and bacardi turnin all the women naughty
I be drinkin everday like im on tour
And I love to get high like bonjour
Take anotha shot, the shits contagious
Like Nicholas cage im up in las vegas
Im sedated, and spaded, aimlessly lookin for faded
Hoes who wanna get naked, cause bitch its underated
So pour me anotha drink im a (cant tell)
And ima take it to the head till they all done
I can barely stand up let alone run
But they name of the game is to have fun
Stick wit me lil mama, promise i wont bite like jefferey dahmer

Neva slow it down like a comet so ima....
