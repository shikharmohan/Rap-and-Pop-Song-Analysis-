Verse 1:
She'll wake up with her son in the morning
Ridin up her room with a smile
make a man feel like a king 
wife to a husband, mother to her child 
prototype for the real women 
for every women wish they could be 
why wouldn`t god want you for himself
that must be why he took you from me
but i always ...
Verse 2:
 
Could go on forever about the 
things i miss about you the most
But it wouldn't make any difference
Ain't no settling back cuz it wont bring it back
But of everything that i will miss
Like how you used to smile at me
Even more then makin love, gonna miss you
Having you around your company
And i always ...
Loving you tenderly 
Taking good care of me
One more importantly 
Just your company
