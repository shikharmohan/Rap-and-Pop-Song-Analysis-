Deuces, remix!
for the ladies, lets go
Nigga you got some nerves
acting like you the business
save that shit for the birds
'cause you done know you fucked up, yeah
trust when I say you won't find another girl yeah
that loves you like C, and touch you like C
too bad that you couldn't even see
I gave my all to you
but you was undercover sleeping with another
all them nights I cried to you
thought that it was only me but it wasn't only me
you got me feeling like a fool
thought that it was perfect, hope that it was worth it
but I'll be okay, no more stress, no more pain
I'll be straight, I'm chucking up them deuces
I'm on some new shit chucking my deuces up to him
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
no more time to make it work
you make me wanna say bye bye
say bye bye
say bye bye to him
I gon hav to say bye bye
say bye bye
say bye bye to him
shouldnt have lied to me
I feel so bad you let me down
but you gon have to see, yeah
you gon wish I was around!
Deuces, chuck, chucking them deuces...
