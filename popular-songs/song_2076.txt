Lie to me, lie to me
Lie to me, lie to me
Lie to me, lie to me
Lie to me, lie
I just wanna be numb
I don't wanna feel a thing
I don't want reality
Actually, reality stinks
How about we just pretend
That your cellphone didn't even ring?
And that I wasn't on the other side of the door
Listening to everything
Tell me another lie
I don't wanna know what I know to be true
What I need you to do, tell me another lie
I don't wanna know what I know to be true
What I need you to do, tell me another lie
I don't wanna know what I know to be true
What I need you to do, tell me another lie
I don't wanna know what I know to be true
What I need you to do, tell me another lie
Lie to me, lie to me
Lie to me, lie to me
Lie to me, lie to me
Lie to me, lie
Please make me believe
That there's nobody for you but me
When I ask who were you talking to
Tell me it was Kimberly
Tell me that last night you didn't leave
After you thought I was asleep
Crept back in at 6:45
Tell me it was just a dream
Baby I need desperately, desperately to believe you
'Cause I won't be held responsible for what I might do
Baby I need desperately, desperately to believe you
'Cause I won't be held responsible for what
What I might to do me another lie
I don't wanna know what I know to be true
What I need you to do, tell me another lie
I don't wanna know what I know to be true
What I need you to do, tell me another lie
I don't wanna know what I know to be true
What I need you to do, tell me another lie
I don't wanna know what I know to be true
What I need you to do, tell me another lie
Tell me another lie
Tell me another lie
Tell me another lie
Tell me another lie
I don't wanna know what I know to be true
What I need you to do, tell me another lie
I don't wanna know what I know to be true
What I need you to do, tell me another lie
I don't wanna know what I know to be true
What I need you to do, tell me another lie
I don't wanna know what I know to be true
What I need you to do, tell me another lie
