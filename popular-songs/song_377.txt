Now that old car, it ain't gonna last
You ride around all day, I buy the gas
The more I work, the more you spend
Tell me honey baby when will this all end
[Chorus:]
Her bags are packed, my nerves are racked
She's got a one-way ticket, ain't comin' back
Oh baby, baby
Where you gonna find a good man like me
Take a look at this house turned upside-down
I hung the clothes on the line, they blowed down to the ground
I try to eat my own cookin' but its awful bland
I'm tellin' you right now things are out of hand
[Chorus 2x]
Where you gonna find a good man like me
