She's got every quality
From A all the way to Z
It's easy to see she's the perfect girl
She's got every single thing
That makes up my wildest dreams
Sometimes I still can't quite believe
She's holding me 'cause
She got it all of my heart, my soul, my wishes
All of my love, my hugs, my kisses
Everything that means anything at all
All of my life I've spent hopin'
I could give someone such devotion
Every sweet memory I can recall
She's got it all
You know that I admit
That someone to love like this
Only existed in my prayers
Until I saw her face
I knew I'd found the place
Where I could keep my every faith
Eternally 'cause
She got it all of my heart, my soul, my wishes
All of my love, my hugs, my kisses
Everything that means anything at all
All of my life I've spent hopin'
I could give someone such devotion
Every sweet memory I can recall
She got it all
All of my life I've spent hopin'
I could give someone such devotion
Every sweet memory I can recall
All of my heart, my soul, my wishes
All of my love, my hugs, my kisses
Every sweet memory I can recall
She got it all
She's got it all
She got it
All of my heart, my soul, my wishes
All of my love, my hugs, my kisses
