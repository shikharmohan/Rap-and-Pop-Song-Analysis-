Touch me, tell me what you want me to do
I want to take a little trip around you
You set me on fire
Ohh, you set me on fire
Lock me up inside of this room
I just wanna be close to you
I can't take it anymore
Baby, I want you so much
I wanna feel your breath on my skin
To find that place we've never been
I wanna spend all night tangled up in your love
Kiss me, kiss me till the sun comes up
Slow, sweet, I can never get enough of your love
You're taking me higher
Ohh, you're taking me higher
Yeah, lock me up inside of this room
I just wanna be close to you
I can't take it anymore
Baby, I want you so much
I wanna feel your breath on my skin
To find that place we've never been
I wanna spend all night tangled up in your love, yeah
Yeah, lock me up inside of this room
I just wanna be close to you
I can't take it anymore
Baby, I want you so much
I wanna feel your breath on my skin
To find that place we've never been
I wanna spend all night tangled up in your love
Tangled up in your love
Tangled up in your love
Tangled up in your bed
Tangled up in your sheets
Tangled up in your head
Tangled up in your love
Tangled up in your love, yeah
