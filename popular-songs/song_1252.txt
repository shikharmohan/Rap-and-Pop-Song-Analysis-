Tear up the photographs, but yesterday won't let go
Every day, every day, every minute
Here comes the emptiness, just can't be lonely you know
Every day, every day, hey, hey
This second chancin's really getting me down
You give and takin' everything I dreamed about
It's time you let me know, let me know, just let go
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
Was a simple way to get over you
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
Was an in-between to escape this desperate scene
Where every law reveals the truth
Baby 'cause all I ever wanted, all I ever wanted was you
I'd rather walk alone, don't wanna chase you around
Every day, every day, every minute
I'd fall a thousand times 'fore I let you drag me down
Every day, every day, hey, hey
Your new beginning was a perfect ending
But I keep feeling we've already been here before
It's time you let me know, let me know, just let go
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
Was a simple way to get over you
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
Was an in-between to escape this desperate scene
Where every law reveals the truth
Baby 'cause all I ever wanted, all I ever wanted was you
Tell me, with so many out there, why I always turn to you?
Your goodbyes tear me down every time
And it's so easy to see that the blame is on me
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
Was a simple way to get over you
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
Was an in-between to escape this desperate scene
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
Was a simple way to get over you
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
Was an in-between to escape this desperate scene
Where every law reveals the truth
Baby 'cause all I ever wanted, all I ever wanted was you
