I'm sittin' here alone, thoughts of you run wild
I'm longin' for your touch, haunted by your smile
No use in tryin' to erase
No one could ever take your place
Well, I remember how it used to feel
Back when our love was strong and real
And I remember tears in your eyes and I looked at you and said goodbye
All I want right now is to forget every single thing that I regret
And drowned out these embers but I remember
It's yesterday again here inside my mind
And I can't find a way to leave your love behind
And I wanna wake up to the day
Your memory won't stand in my way
Well, I remember how it used to feel
Back when our love was strong and real
And I remember tears in your eyes, I looked at you and said goodbye
All I want right now is to forget every single thing that I regret
And drowned out these embers but I remember
Well, I wanna wake up to the day
Your memory won't stand in my way
Well, I remember how it used to feel
Back when our love was strong and real
And I remember tears in your eyes and I looked at you and said goodbye
All I want right now is to forget every single thing that I regret
And drowned out these embers but I remember, ohh
And I remember, ohh, oh, I remember you, baby
Oh, all of you, my baby
