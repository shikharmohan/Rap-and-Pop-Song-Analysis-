Do you remember what you said to me the day I met you?
Like yesterday I still can hear your voice, you promised to be
Still in my life no matter what you had to do to be there
Well, it's been a while and here we are lookin' back on times
That we shared
I still imagine us being young and so in love
Never apart, you were my heart
Seems like it's always just been us
I remember we were in the park, holding hands and you said to me
I'm the only thing you need and I would make your life complete
If I said I'd be your girl, you would stay with me forever
Boy, you never let me down through it all you're still around
Still around yeah
I still believe in all the things you said to me in those days
You gave me love and kept your word with every promise you made
I sing your favorite song inside my head when you're not with me
Until you come back home and take me in your arms and hold me
I can imagine us being old and still in love
Never apart, you are my heart
Makes me smile, we're still in love
I remember we were in the park, holding hands and you said to me
I'm the only thing you need and I would make your life complete
If I said I'd be your girl, you would stay with me forever
Boy, you never let me down through it all you're still around
(Looking back through all the years)
Heh, you remember the first time I went to your house
And your father looked at me like I had three heads
  (And I never will forget the day)
We were so in love
(Looking back through all the years)
You were so beautiful, so young
  (And I never will forget the day you came into my life )
I can't believe you're still mine
  (And what you said to me)
That's crazy, I love you
I remember we were in the park, holding hands and you said to me
  (We were in the park holding hands)
I'm the only thing you need and I would make your life complete
  (And I would your life complete)
If I said I'd be your girl, you would stay with me forever
  (I'm still your girl)
Boy, you never let me down through it all you're still around
  (I'll never let you down, my baby)
I remember we were in the park, holding hands and you said to me
I'm the only thing you need and I would make your life complete
If I said I'd be your girl you, would stay with me forever?
  (Said I'd be your girl and)
Boy, you never let me down through it all you're still around
Still around yeah
