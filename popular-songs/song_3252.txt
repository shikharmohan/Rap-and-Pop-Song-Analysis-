(1st Verse)
11/8/71 mama brung the gun
to this world and ever since it's been tons of fun
Leavin' bitches stun off in they lungs I come,
hella spun Give her the slap on the buns and run
I got money mane,
gimme dumby dames,
make her honey drain a funny thang her tummy pains
All I want is sex drugs and rock n' roll,
rap and liquor, flockin' hoes
Got the drop and I lock and load
Haters can fuck off,
flee with ya tough talk,
this is no mercy thirsty for blood
and I bust off I am the reason they
find you stiff with ya nuts off,
cut cross and dusted off for yappin'
too much boss Rules don't apply to me,
America lie to me, so ain't no way you
containing this devil inside of me
And ya children they love it,
how I'm rebel and rugged,
if it ain't about the way that
I can clutch a ducket muthafuck it
(CHORUS) Bad's in town (you can't get rid of me)
Nab stand down (might as well let it be)

Cash and crowns (I'm everything you're thinkin' of)

(a nightmare there he go right there)
I am everything you ever were afraid of
(very mean bitch I am everything)
((HED) P.E.)
