I just wanna be
I just wanna be
Takin' away the fact that I care about you
It's just your way, so sweet
Everything seems right around you
Did you know that you have
This common way about you in your touch?
And I wanna know if I could be your girl
You are everything
And everything is you
You are everything
And everything is you
You are everything
And everything is you
You are everything
And everything is you
I'm happy to say in a lot of ways
You changed me makes me smile
When you said you were glad the day you found me
I'm wishin' away any harm that might ever find you
Heaven knows I really feel, I'll always be your girl
You are everything
And everything is you
You are everything
And everything is you
You are everything
And everything is you
You are everything
And everything is you
The one who puts her arms around you
The one who lays her beside you
The one who listens when you need it
When no one else sees, I could see it
The one who knows when it's somethin's wrong
The one who knows your favorite song
The one who all your family loves
The one you place no one above
You are everything
And everything is you
You are everything
And everything is you
You are everything
And everything is you
You are everything
And everything is you
The one who's true to you, I'm down for ya
The one who makes you smile and laughs with ya
The one who holds you down, I'm down for ya
I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the one who's true to you, I'm down for ya
The one who makes you smile and laughs with ya
The one who holds you down, I'm down for ya
I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one
The one who's true to you
The one who makes you smile
The one who holds you down
I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one
The one who's true to you
The one who makes you smile
The one who holds you down
I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one
I can be anything you need
