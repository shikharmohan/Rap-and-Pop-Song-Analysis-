I was chillin with a bitch n I was noticin she was so sadistic/ Wanted the Ninna to bite on the nipples n twist it/ Suckin me off until she lost all of her lipstick/ You know how it is when you ex-in on like seven of em/ With a stick of sherm n aterol, nigga heaven love em/ Cuz they get you lifted n thinkin you unstopable/ But whut I'm bout to tell was so fuckin impossible/ I started givin the bitch my dick, she lovin the way my jimmy be jabbin it/ Wanted me to cut her up, I said "never", she said "imagine it with the tip of her butcher knife"/ I think I took her life/ This crazy hooker like pain that I put her right/ Fuckin high n its insane how she look it life/ She wish a nigga had fangs, n he took bite/ I'm beatin it up with the aim for the pussy like, the pussy liked to be banged like it took a fight/ Then she asked me to smack'er/ Then she asked me to choke'r/ So I choked her/ As a nigga got closer to the nut I choked her even harder, when I rose up out the chocha/ She wasn't breathin, a horrible evenin/ Couldn't get her to breathe, I really tried ta/ Did all I could, but it wasn't all to the good/ So I had to call the ambulance over to come revive'r/

Shit I was only sixteen, just showin off/ Never would've imagined the gun just goin off/ I'm just trin ta show these niggas that I wasn't soft/ I stayed off 87th street so thats whut all these niggas thought/ 
Cuz they was from Hill Top, where niggas pill pop/ So I'm pullin up to the chill spot, with the steel cocked/ Still not - sure whut I was thinkin/ N back then I wasn't even drinkin/ So I'm leavin Lincoln Highschool off Woodland/ Headed to the hood so I could hang out with the hoodlums/ Couldn't wait to show em whut I as packin/ Knock on the door, n he answered like "whats crackin?" n I said
"Shit. Just chillin, just me n my bitch. But my bitch, I mean that fo-fif thats sittin on my hip. Wanna see?" He said "yeah let me see!" I pulled it out n gave it a good squeeze/ I didn't know it didn't have no safety/ Now this mans hittin his chest, and he can't breathe/ Devil on my shoulder whisperin "Leave nigga, leave!" But I swear...
