People always said that hindsight's twenty-twenty
When it comes to mistakes in love, girl I've got plenty
But the one that sticks out the most in my mind
Is the night I left you standing on the front porch crying
Living for the day I could make it all up to you
Till you're back in my arms, back in my arms again
Till you're back in my arms, I'll be all lonesome till then
And honey, I won't eat and I won't even sleep
I'll be walking these soles off of both of my feet
Till you're back in my arms, back in my arms again
Well, I'm getting to know this old town like never before
Walking every street knocking on every door
Girl, wherever you are I want you back
I love you baby and I'm sure about that
Whatever it takes there's nothing that I won't do
Till you're back in my arms, back in my arms again
Till you're back in my arms, I'll be all lonesome till then
And honey, I won't eat and I won't even sleep
I'll be walking these soles off of both of my feet
Till you're back in my arms, back in my arms again
I must have been a fool I confess
To ever let you go but I ain't gonna rest
Till you're back in my arms, back in my arms again
Till you're back in my arms, I'll be all lonesome till then
Honey, I won't eat, I won't even sleep
I'll be walking these soles off of both of my feet
Till you're back in my arms, back in my arms again
