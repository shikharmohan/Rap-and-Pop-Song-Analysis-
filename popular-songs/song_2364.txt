Damn, I really messed up this time
But I'm-a make it up to you
Listen
Seems just like the other day
You were my woman
Shoppin' malls and holidays
Couldn't tell us nothin'
Now you're gone away and I'm
Still trynna deny it
But I'm tired from this pain
And I just can't hide it
It's like oohoohooh
I just can't get over you
Girl oohoohooh
It's feels like I caught the flu
Girl I'm sick from all these lies and these games
And I'm sick from bein' the reason we turned out this way
I'm trynna act like I don't wanna be with you
Like I would be okay
If you just walked away
I'm trynna act like I don't wanna see you
Like you were just a face
I'll forget you in a day
I'm trynna act like I can do without feelin' on your booty
Find another ghetto cutie
To do me like you do me yeah yeah
But I'm just so addicted to you
I'm-a try but I can't
'Cuz you're all I'm trynna do
See you here and there with your friends
And I start the frontin'
Act like I been doin' my thing
And I don't need your lovin'
But you see it in my eyes
Girl something just ain't right
Since we don't share this bed no more
I can't sleep at night
It's like oohoohooh
I just can't get over you
Girl oohoohooh
It's feels like I caught the flu
Girl I'm sick from all these lies and these games
And I'm sick from bein' the reason we turned out this way
I'm trynna act like I don't wanna be with you
  (Ooh, ohh)
Like I would be okay
(Be okay)
If you just walked away
(Walked away)
I'm trynna act like I don't wanna see you
  (I don't wanna see you baby)
Like you were just a face, I'll forget you in a day
I'm trynna act like I can do without feelin' on your booty

To do me like you do me yeah yeah
But I'm just so addicted to you

Guess I'm changin' out the door
  (Oh, can't play it off like I'm so cool)
Girl you know I'm goin' straight out my mind
I can't stop thinkin' 'bout the things we did and the way we kissed
I know it ain't right playin' like you ain't my time girl
