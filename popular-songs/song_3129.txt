Got 'em all under pressure
[Chorus]
Hey motherfucker hey motherfucker hey
We can do it nigga any motherfuckin way
Gansta shit gansta shit gone play
But you can be the bitch and go the other fuckin way
You gotta respect us
We got guns and we got a whole plethra
And I betcha
Every motherfuckin nigga in yo secta sick 'cause we got 'em under pressure (pressure)
[Young Droop]
I gotta let it be known
I'm in the zone, gone, blown
Tryin' to beat the nigga 
That was independent from the beginnin'
You bet that imma win it when I'm finished
Niggas and bitches be trippin'
Becuase I got the cum on the titties but
Do I fit the description (Hell yeah)
Muthafucka that's the reason why
You filled with so much tension (bitches)
I'm here with the couple's of
Individual switchin'
Tryin' to get together
But anotha nigga dissin'
I'm ready for the battle
With no matter whatever
You better be clever
Nigga use your thoughts
Now nigga who's the boss
Nigga look who you crossed
A muthafuckin' sav
Nigga yo whole crew took the loss
I think ya better beware
Whenever you just try to make a move
Everybody bringin' a pistol
What you tryin' to prove
Do what you doin'
'cause you the one that's lookin like a foo
And I guarantee that you'll be up for doom
Until that the Hollywood terror
You need the weapon 
That was kept up in the skeleton 
For way too many years
Whenever they comin' to kill all my niggas
And they feel to me that all I wanna do is make a few things clear
Well fuck' em, fuck 'em
I hate it when I'm hated
Because I gotta be separated for the nation
I try to be patient
But niggas be trippin'
And switchin', actin' like bitches
But look at the individual they facin'
And put me in the Cali Co lyrical Jason
I recommend for you to get to runnin'
Because I'm comin' to snatch ya
I'm at ya
My lyrical, miracle flow
Is takin' you and your ho
To another dimension
Leavin' you lost
The sickest nigga ever to come out the Valley District
Take it like you don't want everyone to know I broke your record
The reason you dissin' and wishin' that they come up missin'
Because I got everybody and they mother under pressure
Got em' under pressure
[Chorus]
[Tech N9ne]
Hey motherfucker hey motherfucker hey
We can do it nigga any motherfuckin way
Gansta shit gansta shit gone play
But you can be the bitch and go the other fuckin way
You gotta respect us
We got guns and we got a whole plethra
And I betcha
Every motherfuckin nigga in yo secta sick 'cause we got 'em under pressure (pressure)
[Young Droop]
I gotta be down because I'm Northbound
And givin' it up for the town
To all the liquor drinkin' niggas in the hood
Tryin' to put the Valley on the map
And people tell me what I'm doin' is good
And keep it real like I should
Homies come up and they give me that
Heard of a couple of sacks
Back to back
To make a nigga wonder why
Then I take it to another level
Just tell me whatever you do
Stay on the mic
And better keep comin' tight
But I love to represent niggas
I know they hate it that I made it
So now they wanna try and put me to the test
But I shoot 'em to the left
Because I got positive people tellin' me
Droopy youre up to dealin' with the best
Now nigga what the fuck is next
Niggas got love for this shit
Like when and whenever dawg
And competition for Nike
Is supposed to be out to get riches
I'm the individual with the biggest balls
Run up with the hog, yippy ya'll
Like my nigga from the mob
Told me, "Little brother you gotta do the job"
Is gonna take somebody like you
To give a sample like an example
With the Valley
Then they'll treat you like a God
The niggas that's bigga than life
The can't even put the price
Put this shit I deliver bringin' to the table
But look what I'm in it
Im bout to go independent
Official Kritikal Records my own label
Leave the niggas fucked up and disabled
You ain't know I'm flowin' and blowin' up
Was a Killa Valley entertainer
To all the rest of you local muthafuckas
Watchin' for danger
Nigga to the mic you's a stranger
They got me rappin' outta anger
Makin' it mandatory to put you in your place
Whenever you find a rebel that's on my level
Like the devil I'm a come heated
Spit fire in his face
I got 'em under pressure
[Tech N9ne]
Hey motherfucker hey motherfucker hey
We can do it nigga any motherfuckin way
Gangsta shit gangsta shit gone play
But you can be the bitch and go the other fuckin way
