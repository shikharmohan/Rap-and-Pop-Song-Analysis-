She's got what I don't
You there to lean on
I wish I could get that off of my mind
But I don't know how
'Cause she don't love you
Anything like I do
But that don't mean anything
'Cause she's the one loving you now
Well, you're only bad crime
Was you used all the right lines
To make a girl like me
Feel like I was one of a kind
You had me believin'
What I had you were needin'
But I guess, there was somethin' missin'
That you needed to find
She's got what I don't
You there to lean on
I wish I could get that off of my mind
But I don't know how
'Cause she don't love you
Anything like I do
But that don't mean anything
'Cause she's the one loving you now
Who says, you need a reason
For gettin' up and leavin'
Frustration sets in
'Cause I know she holds you tight
I guess, it's human nature
To want to find a reason
'Cause one good reason would make me
Sleep a little better tonight
She's got what I don't
You there to lean on
I wish I could get that off of my mind
But I don't know how
'Cause she don't love you
Anything like I do
But that don't mean anything
'Cause she's the one loving you now
No that don't mean anything
'Cause she's the one loving you now
