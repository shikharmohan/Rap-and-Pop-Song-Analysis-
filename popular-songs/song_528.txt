Hey, I want a, want a nasty girl
All about the party, not a backseat girl
Upfront with it, bigger than a track meet girl
First number saved in my Blackberry Pearl
Call up shawty, showin' out for the world
Get it down, center stage, all the freaks want her
Money in the waist, singin', finna get served
Don't trip, give it to 'em, I'ma let you feel her curves
Take off her clothes, get loose for that dough
So rockin' juice, abusin' that Mo
Trill off the Goose, she droppin' and reload
Never no excuse for this girl when it's freak mode
Yep, she's the real deal, yep, give her dollar bills
Yep, on the holla tip, yep, shawty outta here
Yep, got a lotta hips, yep, with the model lips
And she gotta get that money

Hey, shawty sweatin' out, do it, let me check it out
Uncut, raw, so we never have to edit out
Pockets on swole, so I never gotta go
Got a lotta bankroll, so the gwop in control
Like I got bees, I be feelin' on you
Can my dawg get a dance for his birthday, boo?
I know I got the cash that you're lookin' for too
For the best Louis bag or the Jimmy Choo shoes
Oh, not a problem, I can solve 'em
Sexy situation, get it to the bottom
Givin' you enough attention, run up into stardom
Hop up in the Lac, give you cover in Escada
That's the nasty stuff that I need
Girl, do your thing, the money, it don't breathe
Dead presidents will come up with a striptease
