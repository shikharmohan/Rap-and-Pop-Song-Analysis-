All:		I can't believe you did this to me after all I did for you
       		Cause you made me so mad and there's nothing you can do
        	You and I were clueless, but you were the most
                And I guess you just got lost                      
                Baby you were just clueless
                (So clueless)
 
		What did I do to deserve this kind of pain?
		Out of all the fights, this was the main
                You said to give it a chance                   
                But I saw you at the dance
                We tried to work it out                      
                But I still had a doubt
All:			(Clueless)
		I just can't take the risk of getting hurt again
        	And you're way worse than other men
                I used to think you had a brain
                But now I know that you're way insane
                You tried to steal my heart away
                And you'll pay for that someday

        	I cant believe I let u play me for a fool
        	N' wt u did was so totally uncool
                I had no clue it would end this way
                And I don't really care of what you have to say
                I'll never forgive you for what you did
                Gosh, I was such a kid
 
All:			(So clueless)
           	But now that I'm grown and mature
        	I realize that I was blind and unsure
                It aint gonna happen no more tho {no mo}
                And it's obviously the end of us, yo
                Now I just wanna scream and shout
                Cause you don't even know what our relationship was about
All:			(So Clueless)
