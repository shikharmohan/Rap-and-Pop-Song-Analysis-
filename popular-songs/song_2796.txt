In the beginning
The nights were long
Under the moonlight
I could do no wrong
You told me
I was everything you wanted me to be
Then summer was over
And the nights grew cold
You got restless
And hard to hold
I tried to be
Everything you wanted me to be
Now you keep staring
At that open door
You got what you wanted
And you still want more
Well look at me
I'm everything you wanted me to be
If I don't keep you satisfied
You can't say that I haven't tried
If I'm not what you want by now
For the life of me I can't see how
I'll ever be
Everything that you want me to be
In the beginning
The nights were long
Under the moonlight
I could do no wrong
(Remember me)
Remember me
I was everything you wanted me to be
If I don't keep you satisfied
You can't say that I haven't tried
If I'm not what you want by now
For the life of me I can't see how
I'll ever be
Everything that you want me to be
Ohh, I'll never be
(I'll never be)
Everything that you want me to be
I'll never be
(Everything that you want)
Ohh, I'll never be
(Everything that you want)
I'll never be
(Everything that you want)
Ohh, I'll never be
(Everything that you want)
I'll never be
(Everything that you want)
