Verse 1:
I cannot explain this feelin'
And it's got me scared
I can feel you touchin' me
Even when you're not here
Your lips on my neck oh baby
Your hands in my hair
Then i look around and see
There's nobody here but me
(Baby)
And I know I'm not crazy
It's the way you make me feel
(When i reminisce, reminisce
I can picture it, oh)
I know it's all in my mind
But baby it feels so real
(And i'm so gone, 
boy you got me on, baby)
Chorus:
When you touch me
When you kiss me
Supernatural (oh)
So supernatural (oh)
When we make love (make love)
I'm so in love (so in love)
Supernatural (so supernatural)
Verse 2:
Finger tips on the small of my back
Boy it gives me chills
Squeeze me 'til I can barely breathe
I'll sucumb to your will
Oooh, I feel you just like the wind as you watch over me
But then i look around and see
There's nobody here but C........baby
And I know I'm not crazy
It's the way you make me feel
(When i reminisce, reminisce
I can picture it, oh)
I know it's all in my mind
But baby it feels so real
(And i'm so gone, 
boy you got me on, baby)
Chorus:
When you touch me
When you kiss me
Supernatural (oh)
So supernatural (oh)
When we make love (make love)
I'm so in love (so in love)
Supernatural (so supernatural)

When Im all alone Im thinkin about your touch
And Im so gone, boy you got me on
Chorus:
When you touch me
When you kiss me
