Well we know it ain't the first time
We know it used to be my past time
And a couple times back we agreed that was gonna be my last time
But I guess last night I plum forgot who's runnin' this show and who's not
Oh I must've been off of my rocker
I must've got some wires crossed
To come in hear claimin' that from here on out
I'm gonna be the boss
Oh it must've been me the big talker
I had a little too much of Johnny Walker
So let's forget about it baby
I must've been off of my rocker
No there ain't no need to stay mad
No need to waste a whole day mad
Though I have to admit honey you look pretty darn cute mad
Oh baby workin' this out can't be that hard, I said I'm gonna be in charge
Well I must've been off of my rocker
I must've got some wires crossed
To come in hear claimin' that from here on out
I'm gonna be the boss
Oh it must've been me the big talker
I had a little too much of Johnny Walker
So let's forget about it baby
I must've been off of my rocker
Oh burn it down now
Yeah I guess last night I plum forgot
Who's runnin' this show and who's not
Oh I must've been off of my rocker
I must've got some wires crossed
To come in hear claimin' that from here on out
I'm gonna be the boss
Oh it must've been me the big talker
I had a little too much of Johnny Walker
So let's forget about it baby
I must've been off of my rocker
Yeah let's forget about it baby
I must've been off of my rocker
Oh I'm sorry about that baby
