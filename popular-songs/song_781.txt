Sometime I feel like a motherless child
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
And sometimes I feel like a motherless child
A long, long way from home
And sometimes I feel like I'm almost gone
Sometimes I feel like I'm almost gone
Sometimes I feel like I'm all alone
A long, a long way from home
Come on, come on
Who's got a shoulder when I need to cry?
I feel restless and I don't know why
I cry for help but still feel alone
Like a motherless child, a long way from home
Lord, I'm lost, I can't find my way
I'm dealing with the struggles in my day to day
My soul is weak and I wanna be strong
I try to run away but I've been running too long
I've been running too long
I've been running
I've been running too long
Like a motherless child
Like a motherless child
Like a motherless child
Like a motherless child
Like a motherless child
Like a motherless child
Like a motherless child
