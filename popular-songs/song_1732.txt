Here I am, dancing in the wind
my back to your face
I see the ocean apond us, near to my feet
you've be smiling the whole time, never said a word
and I said what are you thinking of, makes you smile that way
and you said
you
your eyes
your smile 
your face
I've been taking you in a while
you
when I'm around
you seem to light up my world
and turn me 'round and 'round
you
I just wanted to laugh
or cry
that was so beautiful
what you just said
but then you turned silent again
as I lifted up my knife
you said, before you kill me
remember this
and you said
you
your eyes
your smile 
your face
I've been taking you in a while
you
when I'm around
you seem to light up my world
and turn me 'round and 'round
you
then I really started to cry 
and I bawled
and I put down my knife
and took you inside my house 
and I told you that I love you
then we did it
the next day I woke up
after being up all night
screaming
I look over to you 
and I started to smile 
and then you said 
why the Hell are you smiling like that for B**ch?
and I said 
ou
your eyes
your smile 
your face
I've been taking you in a while
you
when I'm around
you seem to light up my world
and turn me 'round and 'round
you

I'm so glad for you
