I been thinkin' how you're wastin'
All that lovin' on someone else
I can't take it, I will make you
Forget all about the one I'll be replacin'
So just say it, I know you've been thinkin' 'bout it
I see you lookin' around
I will give you what you're missin'
What you see in me when you think no one's watchin'
Don't wait too long
I'm not that strong
I can't hold on
Much longer
Oh
(Don't wait too long)
I see it now
I know your dirty little secret
Oh
(Don't wait too long)
I got you now
I found your dirty little secret
You don't touch, you don't talk
You don't look me in the face
Your dirty little secret
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I don't care what they say
I'll deal with anythin' if it gets you next to me
I don't want just a taste
I want you anytime
I feel a little craving
I'm not that strong
I can't hold on
Oh
(Don't wait too long)
I see it now
I know your dirty little secret
Oh
(Don't wait too long)
I got you now
I found your dirty little secret
You never touch, you never talk
You never look me in the face
Your dirty little secret
What are you hiding in your covers
Like to wait, little lover
What will you do when they discover
Your eyes on another?
Why you runnin' 'round in circles
Tryin' so hard to discourage
Tellin' secrets that'll surface
One way or another
Oh
I see it now
I know your dirty little secret
Oh, oh
I got you now
I found your dirty little secret
You never touch
You never talk
You never look me in the face
You never touch
You never talk to me
You never look me in the face
Your dirty little secret
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Dirty, dirty secret
Na, na, na, na
Dirty
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Dirty
