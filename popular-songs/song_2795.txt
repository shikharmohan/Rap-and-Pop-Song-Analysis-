Well, it looks like you're alone again
I heard about your misery
She took you around the bend
And now you're coming back to me
That's all she wrote
Forget about her, let her go
That's all she wrote
And I love to say I told you so
I think I knew what happened late last night
I can tell by looking in your eyes
She spelled it out in black and white
And she left no room for compromise
That's all she wrote
Forget about her, let her go
That's all she wrote
And I love to say I told you so
I could see it from a mile away
But I don't wanna rub it in
All I want is just to hear you say
That you're ready, are you ready
To love me again?
That's all she wrote
Forget about her, let her go
That's all she wrote
And I love to say I told you so
Oh, we can put all behind us now
Let's pretend it never happened
We'll forget about the pain somehow
If you're ready, are you ready
To love me again?
That's all she wrote
Forget about her, let her go
That's all she wrote
And I love to say I told you so
That's all she wrote
And I love to say I told you so
That's all she wrote
