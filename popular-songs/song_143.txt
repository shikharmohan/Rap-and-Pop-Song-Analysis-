Maybe its the way that the stars are aligned
That's making me feel this way tonight
Maybe its the words you left unsaid
Maybe its the stardust in my head
But I wanna tell ya, that my heart is bustin' at the seams
Yeah, and I can't wait another minute
Life is short 
Love is sweet
Ain't no time like this time, baby
Maybe its the way that the night is still
Or the sound of the rain on my windowsill
Thats making all the pieces fit
Making it all make perfect sense
But I wanna tell ya, that my heart is bustin' at the seams
Yeah, and I can't wait another minute
Oh, life is short
Love is sweet
Ain't no time like this time, baby
Ooooh yeah
It goes by so fast
Can't get it back 
There ain't no time
Like this time...
Yeah, I just wanna tell ya, that my heart is bustin' at the seams
Yeah, and I can't wait another minute
Ohh, life is short
Love is sweet
Ain't no time like this time, baby.
My little baby
Maybe its the way that the stars are aligned
And there ain't no time, ain't no time, 
Ain't no time like this time, baby
Oooohh yeah.
Maybe its the way that the night is still
Or the sound of the rain on my windowsill
Yeah, yeah
