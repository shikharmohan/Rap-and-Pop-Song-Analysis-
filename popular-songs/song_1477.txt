Please come to Boston for the springtime
I'm stayin' here with some friends
And they've got lots of room
You can sell your paintings
On the sidewalk
And by a cafe where
I hope to be workin' soon
Please come to Boston
She said, "No, boy you come home to me"
And she said, "Hey ramblin' boy
Why don't you settle down?
Boston ain't your kind of town
There ain't no gold and there ain't nobody like me"
"I'm the number one fan
Of the man from Tennessee"
Please come to Denver to see the snowfall
Move up into the mountains
So far that we can't be found
And throw I love you echoes
Down the canyons
And then lie awake at night
'Til they come back around
Please come to Denver
She said, "No, boy you come home to me"
And she said, "Hey ramblin' boy
Why don't you settle down?
Denver ain't your kind of town
There ain't no gold and there ain't nobody like me"
"I'm the number one fan
Of the man from Tennessee"
Now that drifter's world, goes round and round
And I doubt if it's ever gonna stop
And of all the dreams
I've lost and found
And all that I ain't got
I need someone to cling to
Somebody I can sing to
Please come to L.A. to live forever
A California life alone
Is just too hard to live
I live in a house that, looks out over the ocean
And there's some stars
That fell from the sky
Livin' up on the hill
Please come to L.A.
She said, "Boy you come home to me"
She said, "Hey ramblin' boy
Why don't you settle down?
L.A. ain't your kind of town
There ain't no gold and there ain't nobody like me"
"I'm the number one fan
Of the man from Tennessee
I'm the number one fan
Of the man from Tennessee"
