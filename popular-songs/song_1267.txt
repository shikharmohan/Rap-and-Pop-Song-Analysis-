I wonder how I ever make it through a day?
How did I settle for the world in shades of gray?
When you go in circles all the scenery looks the same
And you don't know why and I looked into your eyes
Where the road stretched out in front of me and I realized
I never lived before your love
I never felt before your touch
I never needed anyone to make me feel alive
But then again I wasn't really livin'
I never lived before your love
I wanted more than just an ordinary life
All of my dreams seemed like castles in the sky
I stand before you and my heart is in your hands
And I don't know how I survived without your kiss
'Cause you've given me a reason to exist
I never lived before your love
I never felt before your touch
I never needed anyone to make me feel alive
But then again I wasn't really livin'
I never lived before your love
I never lived before your love
And I don't know why, why the sun decides to shine
But you breathed your love into me just in time
I never lived before your love
I never felt before your touch
I never needed anyone to make me feel alive
But then again I wasn't really living
I never lived, I never lived before your love
