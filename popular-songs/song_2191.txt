One baby to another says I'm lucky to have met you
I don't care what you think unless it is about me
It is now my duty to completely drain you
I travel through a tube and end up in your infection
Chew your meat for you, pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss from my mouth to yours
I like you
With eyes so dilated I've become your pupil
You've taught me everything without a poison apple
The water is so yellow, I'm a healthy student
Indebted and so grateful, vacuum out the fluids
Chew your meat for you, pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss from my mouth to yours
I like you
You, you, you
You, you
One baby to another says I'm lucky to have met you
I don't care what you think unless it is about me
It is now my duty to completely drain you
I travel through a tube and end up in your infection
Chew your meat for you, pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss from my mouth to yours
Sloppy lips to lips, you're my vitamins
I like you
