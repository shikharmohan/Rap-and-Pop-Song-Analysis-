You said you needed your space
Oh, I wasn't where you wanted to be
I didn't stand in your way
I only want you to be happy
And so how surprised am I
To see you here tonight
Well, can't you see
That for worse or for better we're better together?
Please just come back home
No, don't say that you're sorry
And I won't say I told you so
Sometimes in our life
We get to where we wonder
If the long road that we're on
Is headin' in the same direction
When it comes to you and me
We're right where I know we should be
Oh, can't you see
That for worse or for better we're better together?
Please just come back home
No, don't say that you're sorry
And I won't say I told you so
I told you so, hey, yeah
Sometimes it's like we're deep in
Nothing but love
And the slightest thing can grow so foolishly
Remind me please
Oh, can't you see
That for worse or for better we're better together?
Please just come back home
No, don't say that you're sorry
You don't gotta say you're sorry baby
Oh, can't you see
That for worse or for better we're better together?
Please just come back home
No, don't say that you're sorry
And I won't say I told you so
And I won't say I told you so
But I told you so, yeah, hey hey hey yeah
Shoulda known better than to leave me, baby
Shoulda known better than to leave me, darlin'
