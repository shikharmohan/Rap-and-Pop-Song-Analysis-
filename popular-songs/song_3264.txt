This is your big homie Bryan B Shynin from hot 103 jams host of underground heat
this next one is called paper, from that Tech N9ne Callabos, the gates mixed plate
Jay Rock
Boy im bout my presidents
benjamins and jacksons
my names Jay Rock, a.k.a. get paper if you askin
catch me out in traffic
traffic insult n' tragic
that magic tryin get that Frank and Lucas and Brittney raa's cabbage
find me on the freeway, doin deals on the 3 way 
if you dont got my paper that chopper split you in 3 ways
my money runnin, it should be a surelay's
no candles on my cake but everyday be my b-day
comin out that gutta, bitch im bout my dollas 
me and Tech up at the bank takin them paper showers
who gives a fuck what you thank, boat niggas envy hard 
gats in my drawers, guns in the car
knock a nigga off it's all about survival dawg

Im bout my paper, you bout some paper lets do some bussiness
if you cross me hundred round magazine you gone get yo issue
Chorus
Paper, paper (8x)
do what we do to survive (gotta get it)
Paper, paper (8x)
Get it like a thief in tonight (you know me)
Paper. paper (8x)
im comin for yours, now its mine (all about it)
Paper, paper (8x)
My mind on money, money on my mind
Tech N9ne
I've sacraficed everyting to get this fuckin money
it'll be a  rap just like a mummy if you try to get it from me
think its funny try to get me when Im stunny
your ??? gets runny when I bust open your tummy, yummy
federal reserve not, better know the darn ropes
better go with her folks, find out that she rollin with your dope
rats never deserve hope, put a knife where word throats 
verbs ?? fangs drain, and not a single word flows
dollars made boss, holla raised cost 
cause all was in squalor because of all your days off
so I gotta get paid off, I'm a baller ??? lost
cautious and your wall look like Ragu and hollandaise sauce
I'm making the ??? no fakin a neighbor for sacred
but if you faces a hater I'll erase your space on place
you better take the bass out your trachea 
Imma waste your ??? and your ???
not a fuckin place will be safer 
Imma say that a scrape be my nature to chase the
Chorus
Paper, paper (8x)
do what we do to survive (gotta get it)
Paper, paper (8x)
Get it like a thief in tonight (you know me)
Paper. paper (8x)
im comin for yours, now its mine (all about it)
Paper, paper (8x)
My mind on money, money on my mind
