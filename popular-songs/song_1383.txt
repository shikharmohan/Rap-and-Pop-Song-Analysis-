Well the news spread through Jerusalem
Tonight a child is born
There are shepherds fallin' to their knees
And angels blowin' horns
But in their golden halls, the pharisees
Scoffed and drank their wine
They said, "It's only Hebrew prophesy
We don't care and besides He's just a kid
That's all He is
One more pebble in the gravel
One more rumor in the rabble
How can He be king? He's just a kid"
Well in no time it seemed
The world was knockin' on His door
Performing miracles and wonders
They had never seen before
Soon the pharisees stopped laughing
The silver sum was paid
And near the end He knelt down
In the garden and He prayed
I'm just a kid, that's all I am
I'll need Your strength to see me through it
If it is Your will I'll do it
But how can I be king, I'm just a kid?
Now I think about the baby
And the man at Christmas time
Of mothers, sons and fathers
And children just like mine
About the power in unselfishness
Love and sacrifice
The gift that we were given
And the price
And how the news spread through Jerusalem
Tonight a child is born
There are shepherds falling to their knees
And angels blowin' horns
I wonder how on earth the pharisees
Could scoff and drink their wine
And say, "He's only Hebrew prophesy
We don't care and besides, He's just a kid
That's all He is
One more pebble in the gravel
One more rumor in the rabble
And how can He be king? He's just a kid"
Oh, how can He be king?
He's just a kid
