Lookin' through a coffee table book
At a small cafe on Broadway
Tryin' to find a way
Out of all trouble and dismay
Travelin' on a road unpaved
Everywhere I look
There's something there to remind me
Of feelings from yesterday
Listenin' to drama and hearsay
Only leaves me empty
You are my friend first
We talk about what hurts
We talk about love
Let's talk about us
Can't you see I want you to be mine?
What matters the most
I just wanna see you up close
When I look into your heart
You got everything I want
Can't you see I want you to be mine?
You do what hasn't been done before
No one loves you more than me
Can't you see I want you to be mine?
You do what hasn't been done before
No one loves you more than me
Can't you see I want you to be mine?
I want you to be mine
Turn the music up
Ridin' on the highway
Thinkin' about the way
That I feel when I'm with you
A feelin' that continues
To make me feel good
Even when I'm not near you
And I want it to stay
Emotions, I have so many
Love can give you plenty
But I know you are my friend first
We talk about what hurts
We talk about love
Let's talk about us
Can't you see I want you to be mine?
What matters the most
Just wanna see you up close
When I look into your heart
You got everything I want
Can't you see I want you to be mine?
You do what hasn't been done before
No one loves you more than me
Can't you see I want you to be mine?
You do what hasn't been done before
No one loves you more than me
Can't you see I want you to be mine?
Everything he does, all of the above
Didn't know 'til I fell in love
Fits me like a glove, do you know
Can't you see I want you to be mine?
Everything he does, fits me like a glove
Didn't know 'til I fell in love
All of the above, do you know
Can't you see I want you to be mine?
You do what hasn't been done before
No one loves you more than me
Can't you see I want you to be mine?
You do what hasn't been done before
No one loves you more than me
Can't you see I want you to be mine?
Be mine, be mine, be mine, be mine
Be mine, be mine, be mine, be mine
Be mine, be mine, be mine, be mine
