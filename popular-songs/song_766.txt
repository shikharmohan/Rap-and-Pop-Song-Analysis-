You see the flashy lights, it's like a movie scene
Them stunna shades got you lookin' like a beauty queen
Without a throne, American but international
She got her hair done, styled in designer jeans
Heels on and her skin type Maybelline, I can't control
The way you walkin' girl, you got me gone
When I see her my mind goes to places
I just can't focus when she's on the stage
It's the way she switches her hips with her body
Just proves she's truly the life of the party now
Look at her she got it, shawty knows she's the shit
You can tell by the look in her eyes, she's like the devil in disguise
When she's on the runway, walkin' down the runway
Sexy down the runway, take a picture on the runway
The show is sold out, they say she's popular
'Cause when she comes out, everybody's watchin' her
She's got the crown, lookin' seductive yet still holds a smile
She's like an angel, I'd say she's heaven sent
From head to toe lil' mama's visual medicine
You should see, this shawty's hotter than the third degree
When I see her my mind goes to places
I just can't focus when she's on the stage
It's the way she switches her hips with her body
Just proves she's truly the life of the party now
Look at her she got it, shawty knows she's the shit
You can tell by the look in her eyes, she's like the devil in disguise
When she's on the runway, walkin' down the runway
Sexy down the runway, take a picture on the runway
Wait a minute, strike a pose
Take a picture, click and girl I gotta know your name
Baby Mary Jane
Look at her she got it, shawty knows she's the shit
You can tell by the look in her eyes, she's like the devil in disguise
When she's on the runway, walkin' down the runway
Sexy down the runway, take a picture on the runway
Sexy down the runway, take a picture on the runway
Tell by the look in her eyes
