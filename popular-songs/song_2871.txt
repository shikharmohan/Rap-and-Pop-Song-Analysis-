When the evenin'
Sun goes down
You can find me
Hangin' around
Oh the night life
Ain't no good life
But it's my life
Many people
Just like me
Dreaming of
Old used to be's
Oh the night life
It ain't no good life
But it's my life
Oh listen to the blues they're playin'
Oh listen to what the blues are sayin'
Mine is just
Another scheme
In a world
Of broken dreams
Oh the night life
It ain't no good life
But it's my life
Play me some blues boys
Oh listen to the blues they're playin'
Oh listen to what the blues are sayin'
When the evenin'
Sun goes down
You can find me
Hangin' around
Oh the night life
It ain't no good life
But it's my life
Ohh
The night life
Ain't no good life
But it's my life
{Oh I love that song
You know I told you about the men
Who have influenced me in my music
Well now I want to tell you about the women
And there's lots of 'em
But this first one I wanna tell you about
I admired her for a long time
First of all, it was because of her songwriting
I liked the way she always told a story in her songs
And then in her singing, I always loved to listen to her sing
She had a different style, a quality about it
She's so witty, so personable, so loveable
And you know no matter whether it's her singing
Her songwriting, or her acting}
