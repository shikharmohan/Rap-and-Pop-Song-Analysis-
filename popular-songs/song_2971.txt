Lately I'm alone a lot
Mostly I guess you're not
Forgive me if I stop and stare
I was just a little unprepared
So the world has fallen at your feet
Yeah, you hardly even missed a beat
Everyday your heart beats a little stronger
But my nights for me get a little longer
You've gone on a million miles from here
Swept up like a feather in the air
Well, you make it look so easy
That doesn't seem quite fair
'Cause baby I'm still tryin'
To get myself up and flying
I should be farther on by now
I just can't seem to catch a breeze somehow
I should be free to leave the ground
With no dreams left to weigh me down
Well, could you tell me what I have to do
I've been tryin' to deny the truth, well ya
But here it is now, the living proof
The one I love loves someone new
You've gone on a million miles from here
Swept up like a feather in the air
Oh, you make it look so easy
That doesn't seem quite fair
'Cause baby I'm still tryin'
To get myself up and flying
Oh, you make it look so easy
It doesn't seem quite fair
'Cause baby I'm still tryin'
To get myself up and flying
Up and flying, up and flying
Ooo yeah
