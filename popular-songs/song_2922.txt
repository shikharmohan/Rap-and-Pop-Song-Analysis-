I've forgotten your number, I hadn't called in a while
And I'm slowly forgetting your funny little smile
I've even stopped missing the love that we knew
But I've never stopped dreaming of you
I've lost all the memories and the feel of your touch
And it's left my mind why I loved you so much
I've even forgotten who walked out on who
But I've never stopped dreaming of you
I've never stopped seeing your face every night
I see it each time that I close my eyes
And time's heal the memories of the pain I went through
But I've never stopped dreaming of you
I've misplaced all the trinkets that you told me to keep
And it's been such a long time since I've lost any sleep
Now I'm doing just fine with somebody new
But I've never stopped dreaming of you
I've never stopped seeing your face every night
I see it each time that I close my eyes
And time's heal the memories of the pain I went through
But I've never stopped dreaming of you
No I've never stopped dreaming of you
