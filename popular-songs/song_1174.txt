It ticks just like a Timex
It never lets up on you
Who said life was easy?
The job is never through
It'll run us 'til we're ragged
It'll harden our hearts
And love could use a day of rest
Before we both start falling apart
Pray that it's rainin' on Sunday
Stormin' like crazy
We'll hide under the covers all afternoon
And baby, whatever comes
Monday can take care of itself
'Cause we got better things that we can do
When it's rainin' on Sunday
Your love is like religion
A cross in Mexico
And your kiss is like the innocence
Of a prayer nailed to a door
Oh, surrender is much sweeter
When we both let it go
Let the water wash our bodies clean
And love wash our souls
Pray that it's rainin' on Sunday
Stormin' like crazy
We'll hide under the covers all afternoon
And baby, whatever comes
Monday can take care of itself
'Cause we got better things that we can do
When it's rainin' on Sunday
Pray that it's rainin' on Sunday
Stormin' like crazy
We'll hide under the covers all afternoon
And baby, whatever comes
Monday can take care of itself
'Cause we got better things that we can do
When it's rainin' on Sunday
When it's rainin' on Sunday
When it's rainin' on Sunday
Let it rain
