Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh, hey
Jingle bells, jingle bells jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Dashing through the snow in a one horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go laughing all the way, ha ha ha
Bells on bobtail ring, making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight
Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh, hey
Jingle bells, jingle bells jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
You know I hate the cold, that's why I always go
Down south to drink some rum on an island in the sun
There's nothing like St.Barts with the palm trees swaying slow
Or being there on Jost Van Dyke when the New Year comes and goes
Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh, hey
Jingle bells, jingle bells jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
