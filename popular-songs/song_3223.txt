Bobby browny and Whitney, you found you a new edition, and
In the beginning it was grinings from the sit down, till he let you know that it was all
on a bitch now, when, after you had you a baby, he wanna start, arguing his excuse to start
sipping the Remy Martin, darkening this relationship
Now every lady grab yo bics if you relate to this, you need ta, get up out those drawls
