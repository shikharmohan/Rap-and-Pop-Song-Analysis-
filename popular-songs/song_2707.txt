PAKE:
Gather 'round me boys
I've a story to tell
'Bout a friend of mine
That you all know well
He's an old cowhand
He's known near and far
He goes by the name
Of John McEntire
1897
Was the year he was born
In Loula, Oklahoma
On a small dirt farm
They say John was born
With a rope in his hand
He wanted to be
A rodeo man
ALL:
A friendly companion
And a rodeo star
There's none greater
Than John McEntire
There's none greater
Than John McEntire
