I'm gonna take that mountain
I was born a stubborn soul
Ain't afraid of the great unknown, nor
The windin' road that's all uphill
This is just a stumblin' block
Intimidating wall of rock
If you think this broken heart will break my will
I'm gonna take that mountain
Ain't nothing gonna slow me down
And there ain't no way around it
Gonna leave it level with the ground
Ain't just gonna cross it, climb it, fight it
I'm gonna take that mountain
It's overwhelmin' lookin' up
Knowin' it's a challenge of
Me against this heartache to survive
I may slip and I may fall
But even if I have to crawl
I will break through to the healin' side
I'm gonna take that mountain
Ain't nothing gonna slow me down
And there ain't no way around it
Gonna leave it level with the ground
Ain't just gonna cross it, climb it, fight it
I'm gonna take that mountain
Ain't just gonna cross it, climb it, fight it
I'm gonna take that mountain
I'm gonna take that mountain
Ain't nothing gonna slow me down
And there ain't no way around it
Gonna leave it level with the ground
Ain't just gonna cross it, climb it, fight it
I'm gonna take that mountain
I was born a stubborn soul
After this is just a stumblin' block
I'm gonna take that mountain
