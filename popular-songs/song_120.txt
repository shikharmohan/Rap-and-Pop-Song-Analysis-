Watching the night set in, tomorrow's a brand new day again
Full of twists and turns you'll never know, and great surprises
And nothing is black and white, with so many colors in this light
Take a brush and paint what's in your dreams, a perfect picture
I'm looking at my reflection, for the answer to the question
Make a wish tonight, and see the twinkle in the rain
There's magic if you close your eyes, so all you have to do is believe the impossible
And wish upon my magic mirror
Believe in miracles, so dreamers always dream forever, forever
Possibilities in your hand, Adventures waiting far off land 
Full of twists and turns you'll never know second chances
So catch a falling star, and keep it close hold it in you heart
And it will shine a light in the dark, and make things clearer
I'm looking at my reflection, for the answer to the question
Make a wish tonight, and see the twinkle in the rain there's magic if you close your eyes
So all you have to do is believe the impossible, and Wish upon my magic mirror
Believe in miracles, so dreamers always dream forever, forever
Take a chance cuz you can and you will see all the possibilities
If you try you will find all the treasure hidden underneath your feet
Make a wish tonight, and see the twinkle in the rain
There's magic if you close your eyes, so all you have to do is believe the impossible
And wish upon my magic mirror
Believe in miracles, so dreamers always dream forever, forever
