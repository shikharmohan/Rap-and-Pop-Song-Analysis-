Aah
I know you and her got somethin' goin' on
And I respect that
But you gotta admit there's somethin' between us
Everything I want, you got it
And I must admit that I'm excited
That girl ain't right for you
See I'm the type for you
And what I'd like to do is chill
Give me
So let a girl be down and come kick it with me
No time to play around 'cuz I'm for real baby
I'm feelin' everything you do
You know that you're feeling this too
So let's keep it real
'Cuz I don't
I don't care about them other chicks
I wanna be the one, only one that can get close to you
So forget about them other chicks
'Cuz they ain't gonna do all the things I'ma do for you
I dont care who you dealin' with
Just let'em know that you found a girl gonna be down for you
So forget about them other chicks
Just forget about them other chicks
Oh I can't
I don't care about them other chicks
I wanna be the one, only one that can get close to you
So forget about them other chicks
'Cuz they ain't gonna do all the things I'ma do for you

Just let'em know that you found a girl gonna be down for you
So forget about them other chicks

Like the days when a song used to make you say oh
That's what you do to me
I'm feelin' you so much I just can't let go
Baby see, I'm daydreaming 'bout your love everyday
And I must say that it's on and it's gravy
So let a girl be down and come kick it with me
No time to play around 'cuz I'm for real baby
