Well, I love her and she's leaving
She met a man, plays in a band last weekend
And he lives out on the west coast
And she says she's got to go
But it's a long, long way from Myrtle Beach to L.A
Anything could change her mind
One sunset or one regret
She could turn around, come back and be mine
Happy endings happen all the time
She's almost finished packing
There's over 2,000 miles, a lot could happen
There's going to be days and days of long stretches
Maybe she'll come back to her senses
'Cause it's a long, long way from Myrtle Beach to L.A
Anything could change her mind
One sunset or one regret
And she could turn around, come back and be mine
Happy endings happen all the time
Well, I ain't waiting on no phone call
I ain't getting my hopes up at all
I ain't setting myself up for a fall
But it's a long, long way from Myrtle Beach to L.A
Anything could change her mind
One sunset or one regret
She could turn around, come back and be mine
Then everything would be just fine
Yea, happy endings happen all the time
It's a long, long way from Myrtle Beach to L.A
