I told this heart of mine our love would never be
But then I hear a voice and somethin' stirs inside of me
Somehow I can't dismiss the memory of your kiss
I guess my heart has a mind of its own
No matter what I do, no matter what I say
No matter how I try I just can't turn the other way
When I'm with someone new I always think of you
I guess my heart has a mind of its own
You're not in love with me so why can't I forget
I'm just your used to be it's wrong and yet
I know forgetting you would be a hopeless thing
For I'm a puppet and I just can't seem to break the strings
I say I'll let you go but then my heart says no
I guess my heart has a mind of its own
I guess my heart has a mind of its own
