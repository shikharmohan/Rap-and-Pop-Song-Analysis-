Everywhere I go, they're staring at her
Every man I know, he wants to have her
I guess I ought to be a jealous man
I look the other way, they're hittin' on her
Every night and day, they telephone her
They try and get to her but I know they can't
Oh, she never lets it go to her heart
She never lets it go that far
When they start talking, she starts walking
Right back to my arms
She can turn every head
But she never lets it go to her heart
She walks into the room
And everybody watches every move
Hoping she don't love me
I know it by the way they hang around
But they don't realize
There's more to her than what meets the eye
That's why I'm certain
No matter what they do to reach her now
She never lets it go to her heart
She never lets it go that far
When they start talking, she starts walking
Right back to my arms
She can turn every head
But she never lets it go to her heart
When they start talking, she starts walking
Right back to my arms
She can turn every head
But she never lets it go to her heart
  (Never lets it go to her heart)
