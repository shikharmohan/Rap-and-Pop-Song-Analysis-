Of all the broken hearts I've had
This one hurts the worst
His love flowed like a river
Now I'm dying of thirst
If loving him too much
Is why I lost him in the end
Then I hope I can live long enough
To make that same mistake again
Well, they say that love can be so strong
That it's the choking kind
I never thought I'd see the day
When love would be a crime
Mistakes can cost a lot
And it sometimes, we lose to win
Oh, I hope I can live long enough
To make that same mistake again
Oh, I may go crazy missing him
Knowing that it's my fault
But how could I have loved him less
Oh, I tremble at the thought
And it's amazing how I'm holding on
With the shape I'm in
Oh, I hope that I can live long enough
To make that same mistake again
