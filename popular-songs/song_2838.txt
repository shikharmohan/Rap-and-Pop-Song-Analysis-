Luck can always change a state of your direction
Leave you looking for another place to run
There's no carrying the weight of your convictions
You just live with what you've done
Chorus:
Silver eagle
100,000 miles beneath your wings
Flying down that broken line
No one's gonna know the way I feel
One more lost and lonely stranger by the highway
Tell me that I'll never see his face again
You're the only one who's ever going my way
Don't you know the state I'm in
Repeat chorus x2
