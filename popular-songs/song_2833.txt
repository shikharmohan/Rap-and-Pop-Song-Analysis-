Well I thought I had seen good looking men in my time
That was before I met you
And I never saw one that I wanted for mine
But that was before I met you
Well I thought I was swinging the world by the tail
I thought I could never be blue
I thought I'd been kissed
And I thought I'd been loved
But that was before I met you
Well I wanted to ramble and always be free
That was before I met you
And I said that nobody could ever hold me
But that was before I met you
Well I thought I was swinging the world by the tail
And I thought I could never be blue
I thought I'd been kissed
And I thought I'd been loved
But that was before I met you
I thought I'd been kissed
And I thought I'd been loved
But that was before I met you
Darling, that was before I met you
