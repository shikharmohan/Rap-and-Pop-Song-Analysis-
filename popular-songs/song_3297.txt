[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Ain't nobody stupid enough to get at me
Full of a lot of lemon Sprite and Hennessy
Betta be on my team and not my enemy
Givin the suckas murder with my energy
See by the way I'm walkin Imma killa
Can see by the way she talkin Imma steal her
Get it poppin you ? Godzilla
And the gloc'll pop if you mix up my scrilla
Listen to me when I say that Imma get it
I know you really loving the way a nigga spit it
It don't matta the whether Ninna gotta grit it
And I never will give a damn about a critic
I don't think you ever seen nobody rougher
? the other the music gotta touch ya
But if I gotta break it down for tha suckas
All killa no filla mutha fucka
[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
The killer in me, is the killer in me [x4]
[Big Krizz Kaliko]
With an arsenal of tongue twisting rhymes
N9ne's music makes for good times (Ahehehe)
[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Hatas you better be ? when you speak with me
I don't think you really wanna be off in the beef with me
Stupid thinkin you wanna come and get a piece of me
Flow anorexic and my flow is obesity
Betta kneel down the moment that I enter
I'm a veteran and you nothin but a begina
Not a devil but you can bet that I'm a sinna
I gotta eat the pretty women up for dinna
I can be little psychotic on the wickedness
It's a homicidal recital when I'm rippin it
And you know we get hella ? when I'm kickin it
It's a fantasy for many but I be livin it
Do whateva I gotta do to get the mill
I get down and dirty and ? with the skill
If you wanna come and get it but know the victory is not in your favor cuz I got the power to kill
[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
The killer in me, is the killer in me [x4]
[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Ask anybody they will say I'm runnin this
I know I got cha lady wantin some of this
My encephalid ain't no tellin what will come of it
Not in trouble I bring em not even if the sun is lit
Got the prophecy it's takin over the nation
Ain't no stoppin me I got the certification
Choppin broccoli count the money that I'm makin
Stop the machory it be funny cuz you fakin
All of my killa homies wanna hit
Put the elbow macaroni on a bitch
Killa killa for real gorilla with tha fist
Let it loose Imma leave ya losin with a stitch
If you thinkin you got it better Imma cut cha
Killin you off and I love it when you suffa
But if I gotta break it down for tha suckas
All killa no filla mutha fucka
[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
The killer in me, is the killer in me [x4]
