I don't like you
And I'm gonna beat you up
Beans, beans, beans
Jessie had some beans
He was happy, happy, happy
And there he ate some beans
Sitting naked, naked
Sitting cross-legged
Naked, naked, naked
And he was happy, happy, happy
That he ate some beans
Wine, wine, wine
Jessie had some wine
He was happy, happy, happy
And he ate some wine
Beans, beans, beans
Daddy ate some beans
And he drank some wine
And he was happy, happy, happy
That he drank some beans
