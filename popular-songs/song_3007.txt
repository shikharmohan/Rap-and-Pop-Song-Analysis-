I saw you softly smiling
And the band begins to play
Your eyes, they seem to whisper
"Let's dance the night away"
We two stepped and we polkaed
But the magic happened when
We waltzed together and knew that we'd never
Be changing partners again
So while the music's playing
Let's hold each other tight
You're heart and mine in three quarter time
And we'll waltz in love tonight
The day is finally over
The kids are all in bed
The troubles of our busy life
Are dancing in our heads
We barely hear the radio
Till waltz begins to play
And there's no concealing the magic, the feeling
Just sweeps our hearts away
So while the music's playing
Let's hold each other tight
You're heart and mine in three quarter time
And we'll waltz in love tonight
Your heart and mine in three quarter time
And we'll waltz in love tonight
