They're comin across the border by the thousands everyday
Lookin' for a better life in the good ol' U.S.A.
Well, everybody's talkin' about the aliens invadin'
While I'm savin' every dime for a Mexican vacation
Me, I'm headed your way, hasta luego Jose
You say ÃÂ¢€Ã"holaÃÂ¢€Ã, I'll say ÃÂ¢€Ã"hiÃÂ¢€Ã
When I pass you at the border slap me a high five
You better pack a poncho 'cause it sure gets cold up here
Me, I'm headed south for hot women and cheap beer

You can have the house and the bills I pay
Welcome to the good ol' U.S.A.
I'm headed your way, Jose
(White sandy beaches, pesos and jalapenos,
Palm trees, ocean breeze, ah man, Dos Equis)
You say ÃÂ¢€Ã"holaÃÂ¢€Ã, I'll say ÃÂ¢€Ã"hiÃÂ¢€Ã
When I pass you at the border slap me a high five
You better pack a poncho 'cause you'll freeze your ass off here
Me, I'm headed south for hot women and cheap beer
Here's the keys to my Chevrolet
You can have the house and the bills I pay
Me, I'm kickin' back in the Mexican shade
I'm headed your way, Jose
(Yeah, I'm hittin' the road, man, give me a little burro to ride on, you
