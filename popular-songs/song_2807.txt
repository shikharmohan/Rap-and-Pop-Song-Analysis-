The sound of your voice the touch of your skin
If we go there it will start all over again
So don't even call there no need for checking in
If it's really over let it just be over
No, we won't be sharing coffee or having lunch from time to time
I won't ask about your family please don't ask me about mine
This is never what I wanted and it's killing me to say
It just has to be this way
We gave all we could we fought the good fight
But no matter how we loved we just couldn't get it right
It hurts to let go but it's harder hanging on
I don't want it to be over but we know that it's over
No, we won't be sharing coffee or having lunch from time to time
I won't ask about your family please don't ask me about mine
This is never what I wanted and it's killing me to say
It just has to be this way
And even if I change my mind
Don't let me hurt me one more time
Stay away from me be as cold as you can be
No, we won't be sharing coffee or having lunch from time to time
I won't ask about your family please don't ask about mine
This is never what I wanted and it's killing me to say
It just has to be this way oh, it just has to be this way
