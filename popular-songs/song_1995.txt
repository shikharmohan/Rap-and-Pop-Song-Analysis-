I don't know where to begin
Fighting a war I can't win
Fighting a memory
Of something that use to be
No matter how hard I fight
All of my strength and my might
Keeps defeating me
It just keeps defeating me
So what I'm trying to say
I know what's happening
Your body is here with me
But your heart and your mind is still with him
Go back to what you know
Go back to where you know your heart is, girl
Just be honest
This is impossible
This is impossible
We'll never work 'cause you don't want it, girl
You belong with him so go back to what you know
Go back to what you know
'Cause this is impossible
Telling me things of you two
Telling me when he was with you
And how he was, oh, so sweet
The way that he use to treat you
It seems you just can't keep him out of your mind
Obvious to me that I'm
Not where you want to be
Baby, you don't want me, no, no
So what I'm trying to say
I know what's happening
Your body is here with me
But your heart and your mind is still with him
Go back to what you know
Go back to where you know your heart is, girl
Just be honest
This is impossible
This is impossible
We'll never work 'cause you don't want it, girl
You belong with him so go back to what you know
Go back to what you know
'Cause this is impossible
And if that's really what you want
I will not stand in your way
You wanna be free, I will let you be
I'd rather you're happy than miserable with me
Back to what you know
Back to what you know
Back to what you know
Said back to what you know
Go back to what you know
Go back to where you know your heart is, girl
  (Where your heart is, girl)
Just be honest
This is impossible
This is impossible
We'll never work 'cause you don't want it, girl
  ('Cause you don't want it)
You belong with him so go back to what you know, hey
Back to what you know, know, know
Go back to what you know
'Cause this is impossible
This is impossible
Said ain't no way to make this last
You're stuck in the past
Pedal to the gas
And drive away
