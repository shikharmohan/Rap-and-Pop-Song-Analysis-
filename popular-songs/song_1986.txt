Hmmm
I can feel the raindrops 
slowly falling,
and they're calling for,
they keep calling for
my knight in shining armor
come and save me,
cause I'm drowning in pain..
I've been hurt
by his mistakes,
so come and take me away,
I put him first,
I thought he'd stay,
but he couldn't weather the storm
so he left me the rain..
Over time, pictures fade
all that's left are these empty frames,
sleepless nights, and stormy days,
I've got proof that people change,
and all that's left are these empty frames
all that's left are these empty...
Can you hear these teardrops
hit my pillow?
They keep falling cause
I kept falling for your dozen thorny roses,
now I'm bleeding,
and I'm lonely again..
now I'm hurt
it's my mistake,
I should have known right away,
I put him first,
I thought he'd stay,
but he couldn't weather the storm 
so he left me the rain..
over time, pictures fade
all that's left are these empty frames
sleepless nights, and stormy days,
I've got proof that people change,
long after the smiles all fade away,
all this endless pain,
all this empty space..
sleepless nights, and stormy days,
I've got proof that people change
over time, pictures fade,
and all that's left are these empty frames
over time, pictures fade,
all that's left are these empty frames,
sleepless nights, and stormy days,
all that's left are these empty...
over time, pictures fade,
and all that's left are these empty frames,
sleepless nights, and stormy days,
I've got proof that people change
all that's left are these empty frames,
all that's left are these empty frames..
