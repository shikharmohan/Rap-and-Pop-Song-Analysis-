Sittin' up on the roof
Sneakin' a smoke by the chimney
Checkin' out the moon and the city lights
He takes off his flannel shirt
And he drapes it around her shoulders
Slides up behind her and holds on tight
And she says, "I don't want this night to end
Why does it have to end?"
Tomorrow she'll be rollin' down I-10 Baton Rouge
LSU 18 years in her rear view
He's got a Friday paycheck lined up down the block
At daddy's shop, it ain't much but it's a job
They've been dreadin' this moment all summer long
The night before life goes on
Ooh, a tear falls off her cheek and
Right when it hits his arm he says
"Come on baby, lets get outta here"
They take one last drive around town
And man it already looks different
He bangs the wheel and says
"Life ain't fair and this growin' up stuff man I don't know
I just don't wanna let you go"
Tomorrow shell be rollin' down I-10 Baton Rouge
LSU 18 years in her rear view
He's got a Friday paycheck lined up down the block
At daddy's shop, it ain't much but it's a job
They've been dreadin' this moment all summer long
The night before life goes on
Yeah, that's what my momma told me
And just like those kids
I didn't wanna listen to no one
Yeah, there's nothin' you can do
There's nothin' you can say
And I know how it feels when love goes away
Tomorrow she'll be rollin' down I-10 Baton Rouge
LSU 18 years and hurry ya do
He's got a Friday paycheck lined up down the block
At daddy's shop, it ain't much but it's a job
They've been dreadin' this moment all summer long
But here it is they don't have long
The night before life goes on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
