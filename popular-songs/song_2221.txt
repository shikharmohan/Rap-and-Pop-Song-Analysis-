Moderate rock
Mayday, every day, my day
Could've had a heart attack, my heart
We don't know anything, my heart
We all want something fair, my heart
Hey!
Hey, hey!
Hey, hey!
Out of town, out of sight, is my heart
Queen of lies, today, my heart
One more on the phone, my heart
One more at the door of my heart
Hey!
Hey, hey!
Mean heart, cold heart
Cold heart, cold heart
Cold heart, cold heart
Cold heart, cold heart
Hey!
