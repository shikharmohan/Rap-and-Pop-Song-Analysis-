Of all the broken hearts I've had this one hurts the worst
His love flowed like a river now I'm dying of thirst
If loving him too much is why I lost him in the end
Then I hope I can live long enough to make that same mistake again
Well they say that love can be so strong that it's the choking kind
I never thought I'd see the day when love would be a crime
Mistakes can cost a lot and it sometimes we lose to win
Oh I hope I can live long enough to make that same mistake again
Oh I may go crazy missin' him knowin' that it's my fault
But how could I have loved him less oh I tremble at the thought
It's amazing how I'm holding on with the shape I'm in
Oh I hope that I can live long enough to make that same mistake again
