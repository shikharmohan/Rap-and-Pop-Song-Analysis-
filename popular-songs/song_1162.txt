It was about five 'til five on Friday
And we were all getting ready to go
And the boss man started screaming
And his veins began to show
He said, "You and you come with me
'Cause you're gonna have to stay"
But my heart was thumping I was jumping
I had to get away
Some days you gotta dance
Live it up when you get the chance
'Cause when the world doesn't make no sense
And you're feeling just a little too tense
Gotta loosen up those chains and dance
Well I was talking with my baby
Over a small glass of tea
When she asked a loaded question
She said, "How do you feel about me?"
My mind was racin' I was pacin'
But the words just wouldn't come
And there was only one thing left to do
I feel it coming on
Some days you gotta dance
Live it up when you get the chance
'Cause when the world doesn't make no sense
And you're feeling just a little too tense
Gotta loosen up those chains and dance
You gotta dance and you gotta dance
You gotta dance and you gotta dance
Some days you gotta dance
Live it up when you get the chance
'Cause when the world doesn't make no sense
And you're feeling just a little too tense
Gotta loosen up those chains and dance
You gotta loosen up those chains and dance
Come on you gotta loosen up those chains and dance
Yeah
