I'm gonna clean the house
I'm gonna fix the fence
In my final hours
I'm gonna tie up these loose ends
I won't leave a note for anyone to find
Tomorrow they'll know
What I've done here tonight
The drastic steps I've taken
Are just an act of desperation
I knew no one would miss me so what the Hell
I fought, I lied, I drank too much
Hurt everyone I've ever touched
And just how much I've hurt you, it's hard to tell
This is not some cry for help
It's goodbye, I wish you well
Because I love you
I'm gonna kill myself
Now, who is that in my easy chair
Now, wait a minute
That's the old me sittin' there
And I thank God, the Devil in me died
'Cause I stand before you, now
A man changed and alive
The drastic steps I've taken
Were just an act of desperation
I knew no one would miss me so what the Hell
I fought, I lied, I drank too much
Hurt everyone I've ever touched
And just how much I hurt you, it's hard to tell
This is not some cry for help
It's goodbye I wish you well
Because I love you
I had to kill Myself
I'm gonna clean the house
I'm gonna fix that fence
In my final hours
I'm gonna tie up these loose ends
