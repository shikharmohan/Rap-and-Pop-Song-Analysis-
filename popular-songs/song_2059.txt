mmm never could they make the word easy to describe it,
technically it doesn't make any sense at all
I could be with another, someone who catches me
but there's just something I love about
they way that you just let me fall
oil and water, we don't mix
but somehow this is comfortable, whoa ohh
I could be happy with a girl thats more my speed
but I enjoy trying to keep up with you, whoa ohh
theys why I say I'd rather fight with you, oh baby
I'd rather fight with you, you hear me
I'd rather fight with you, than make love to somebody else
I can't stand it when you get cranky, I despise it
even though more than half of the time it's my fault
you don't like nothing that I like, right when your left
and left when you're right
oh but if it ain't you girl, I'll take nobody at all
oil and water, we don't mix
but somehow were comfortable
I could be happy with a girl thats more my speed
but I enjoy trying to keep up with you ,whoa ohh
thats why I say I'd rather fight with you,oh baby
I'd rather fight with you, you hear me
I'd rather fight with you, than make love to somebody else
I could find a girl that knows me well but I think that
I'd be bored as hell, see the beautiful thing about you 
is that I never can tell
I could be happy with a girl thats more my speed
but I enjoy trying to keep up with you, whoa ohh
theys why I say I'd rather fight with you, oh baby
I'd rather fight with you , you hear me
I'd rather fight with you than make love to somebody else (x3)
