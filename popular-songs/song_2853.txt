Funny how love comes and goes
With the tears that fill my life, does it show?
So listen to my heart beat once again
Because of you I hope this feelin' never ends
Silly me, I fell in love again
We started out as friends
You'd think I would have learned from the hurt before
Foolish me, should I have closed the door?
Promised even swore
To never love this way
Oh, foolish me
They say that, love's a chance you take
You know, I've had my share
But when the nights get oh so cold, I need you there
They say that, love's a chance you take
You know, I've had my share
But when the nights get oh so cold, I need you there
Silly me, I fell in love again
We started out as friends
You'd think I would have learned
Oh, foolish me
Silly me
