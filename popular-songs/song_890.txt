Something I did Something I don't 
I can't explain how to 
I cant' speak for everybody but 
[Verse 1]
There must be more good women than men percentage wise 
So her chance of having a husband just minimized
That's why a lot of girls claim they ain't into guys 
and mess with other girls part time to improvise 
I knew she wouldn't ride though I seen it in her eyes 
And I'm like any other guy tryin' get in her thighs 
She telling me 'bout how black people should enterprise 
And I'm like if you don't get yo' ass in this ride from Enterprise 
That I rented it yesterday and got to have in by 5 
With the gass fully filled up like I didn't drive 
Told her had a girl dawg fuck it I didn't lie 
told this rap game is all right I'm just getting by 
She had a little weed and we get a little high
And I'm looking in her eyes and I'm loving her vibe
Told me back in 95 she fell in love with the tribe 
boo back in 92 I was just like you 
Please don't get confused by the ice and jewels 
I'm like any other nigga  buy ice to stay cool 
Like any other nigga that claim they hate school 
And think yeah Free's banging but she no Rachel 
[Chorus] 
We ball till we fall 
Hit the mall 
After we hit don't call 
Fill your lives 
With nothing but lies 
And I would like to apoligize 
(repeat twice) 
You can't stand right here 
And tell me everything is going to be all right 
'cause until the day a real man stands up I'm going have to improvise 
[Verse 2]
Was it something I did wrong yeah I know I'm wrong 
She's at home alone and I'm always gone 
Hate it when she mad but more when she passive 
Now she on the internet looking for classes 
Out of state though man that hurt yo 
But I got work though and I'm at work yo 
And she don't call alot but when she do she pouring out her heart 
You never listen to me then the call drop mmmmm 
And I promised her everything 
Told her when I get a deal I'll get her a wedding ring 
But when I got my deal I was back in the ring 
Fighting my urges 
Strip club splurges 
Never had money so I felt like a virgin 
And I'm trying to break the banks cherry 
Trying see can I afford Carnaries
With a Ferrari and a dinner date with Halle Berry 
Went from 50gs to 50 hundred in a week 
Now I'm trying to call 
One ring Two ring Seven ring Eight ring 
Some other picked up the phone 
Like she at school and she don't stay here no more 
I guess it's more good women than men percentage wise 
So her chance of having a husband in minimize 
I guess that's why she say she ain't into guys 
Focus on school full time to improvise 
[Chorus]
