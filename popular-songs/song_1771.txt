Hey
I'd like to say
A little thing to everyone out there
In America and the world
(Listen up yall)
Please will you
Forgive me
(Forgive her please)
I am sorry I made the mistakes 
I made
And here's my apology
[Chorus:] 
I'm sorry
For the pictures
First for the ones
With me and my best friend
Those were just pretend
Pictures
I'm not really that way
Second
I'm sorry
For the Vanity Fair pictures
Those probably weren't the best
But yet
I'm sorry
(she's sorry)
Oh
I'd like you to forgive me
But I can't make you like me
But
Hopefully this changes your mind
(changes your mind)
[Chorus]
oh yeah
I'm sorry
