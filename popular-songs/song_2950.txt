He said please come to Boston for the springtime
I'm stayin' here with some friends and they've got lots of room
You can sell your paintings on the sidewalk
By a cafe where I hope to be workin' soon
Please come to Boston
I said no, boy won't you come home to me?
I said, hey ramblin' boy why don't you settle down?
Boston ain't your kind of town
There ain't no gold and there ain't nobody like me
I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee
He said please come to Denver with the snowfall
We'll move up into the mountains so far we can't be found
And throw our, I love you, echoes down the canyon
And then lie awake at night until they come back around
Please come to Denver
I just said no, boy won't you come home to me?
And I said, ramblin' boy why don't you settle down?
Denver, ain't your kind of town
There ain't no gold and there ain't nobody like me
I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee
Now that drifter's world goes 'round and 'round
And I doubt if it's ever gonna stop
But of all her dreams he's lost or found he knows that I ain't got
He still needs to need you somebody he can sing to
He said please come to L.A. to live forever
A California life alone is just too hard to build
I live in a house that looks out over the ocean
And there's some stars that fell from the sky livin' up on the hill
Please come to L.A.
I just said no boy, won't you come home to me?
And, I said, ramblin' boy why don't you settle down?
L.A. can't be your kind of town
There ain't no gold and there ain't nobody like me
I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee
I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee, Tennessee
