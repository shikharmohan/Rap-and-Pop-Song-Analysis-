I had a heck of a time gettin' into my house today
There was a big ass u-haul trailer in my way
And she was headed for the car, so I grabbed my old guitar
I got one more chance before she drives away, so
Hank, don't fail me now, you've always bailed me out
Your cheatin' heart could set that suitcase down
Give me one more song to whine that'll make her change her mind
'Cause she's walkin' out, Hank don't fail me now
Yeah, she was throwin' stuff, cussin' like a sailor at me
She was waving her arms around like she was fightin' bees
If I could yodel her a lick that just might do the trick
If I sang I saw the light would she believe? I don't think so, so
Hank, don't fail me now you've always bailed me out
Your cheatin' heart could set that suitcase down
Give me one more song to whine that'll make her change her mind
'Cause she's walkin' out, Hank don't fail me now
Hank, don't fail me now you've always bailed me out
Your cheatin' heart could set that suitcase down
Give me one more song to whine that'll make her change her mind
'Cause she's walkin' out, Hank don't fail me now
She's walkin' out, Hank don't fail me now
She's walkin' out, Hank don't fail me now
