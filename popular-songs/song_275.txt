You used my love
You used my heart
The saddest fight, no delight, you and I
Nothing left but memories
The sacrifice has hurt my life
You roll the dice
You don't know what you've done to me
You said you're sick of all these lies
This plan did not realize
That you got in mind baby
Was it worth to sacrifice
To break my promise of my life
You call me crying like a baby
[Chorus]
Don't fight for me
You took my air to breath
No chance to deceive so why you're missing me
Don't fight for me
You took my air to breath
No chance to deceive so why you're missing me
Why you're missing me
Why you're missing me
Stop trying kissing me, no ain't coming back no more
Don't fight for me
You took my air to breath
No chance to deceive so why you're missing me

I know you're gone, when I was close
My eyes are easily closin' you can give it away from me
I gave you trust, all my love
Now it's over, yes I do admit
It hurt so bad
You said you're sick of all these lies
This plan did not realize
That you got in mind baby
Was it worth to sacrifice
To break my promise of my life
You call me crying like a baby
[Chorus]
Don't fight for me
You took my air to breath
No chance to deceive so why you're missing me
Don't fight for me
You took my air to breath
No chance to deceive so why you're missing me
Why you're missing me
Why you're missing me
Stop trying kissing me, no ain't coming back no more
Don't fight for me
You took my air to breath
No chance to deceive so why you're missing me
When I'm thinking of the words that you promised to me
Then I ask myself why s--t always happen to me
(Why s--t always happen to me)
[Chorus]
Don't fight for me
You took my air to breath
No chance to deceive so why you're missing me
Don't fight for me
You took my air to breath
No chance to deceive so why you're missing me
Why you're missing me
Why you're missing me
Stop trying kissing me, no ain't coming back no more
Don't fight for me
You took my air to breath
No chance to deceive so why you're missing me
Why you why you why you
Why you're missing me
Why you why you why you
Can't love deceive
