[Jason Aldean]
I really hate to let this moment go
Touching your skin, and your hair falling slow
When a goodbye kiss, feels like this
[Chorus] (Kelly Clarkson and Jason Aldean)
Don't you wanna stay here a little while?
Don't you wanna hold each other tight?
Don't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight?
Don't you wanna stay here a little while?
We can make forever feel this way
Don't you wanna stay?
[Kelly Clarkson]
Let's take it slow, I don't wanna move too fast
I don't wanna just make love, I wanna make love last
When you're on this high, it's a sad goodbye
[Chorus] (Kelly Clarkson and Jason Aldean)
Don't you wanna stay here a little while?
Don't you wanna hold each other tight?
Don't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight?
Don't you wanna stay here a little while?
We can make forever feel this way
Don't you wanna stay?
[Kelly Clarkson]
Oh yeeah
[Jason Aldean]
Oh, you feel so perfect, baby
[Kelly Clarkson]
That it feels so perfect, baby
[Chorus] (Kelly Clarkson and Jason Aldean)
Don't you wanna stay here a little while?
Don't you wanna stay here a little while?
Don't you wanna hold each other tight?
Don't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight?
Don't you wanna stay here a little while?
We can make forever feel this way
Don't you wanna stay? 
[Kelly Clarkson]
Don't you wanna stay
