(1st verse)
I Fantasized about this back in Chicago 
mercy mercy me that mercy yalago thats me the first year that i blow
how you say broke in Spanish? me no hablo
me drown sorrow in that diablo
me found bravery in my bravado 
Dj needs to listen to the models 
you aint got no fucking Yeezy in your serados?!      (you ain't got no Yeezy nigga?) 
stupid, But what the fuck do i know? 
i'm just a Chi-town nigga with a Nas flow 
and my bitch and that new bebe follow 
so much head i woke up in sleepy hollow 
Can we get much higher 
(2nd verse) 
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
sex is on fire im the king of fire 
im the king of Leona Louis 
vion the truest hey teacher teacher tell me how do you respond to students
and refresh the page,
and restart the memory,
respark the soul, 
and rebuild the energy
we stop the ignorance,
we kill the enemies, sorry for the nights de-mons still visit me
the plan was to drink it till the pain over but whats worse, the pain or the hangover?
fresh air rolling down a window 
Too many Urkel's on your team thats why you're Winslow 
Don't make me pull the toys out huh? don't make me pull the toys..
and fire up the engines and then they make noise  
can we get much higher
