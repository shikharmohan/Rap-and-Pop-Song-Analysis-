To feel a new touch, to smell a new scent
To learn a new love, the kiss of new lips
To feel a new trust, you know that's hard to find with people nowadays
I'd say that I'm so glad to find a new valentine
To start all this, all over
Without no vision or way of how it's supposed to be
See back then I was so young but now I'm much older
So I won't make the mistakes bein' I just couldn't see
I'm thinkin' that we need a harmony
So this here is the perfect harmony
To see a new face, to hold a new hand
To live a new life, to be a new man
To win a new heart, you know that cupid's arrow's not right all the time
But your smile is like the sun that rise, so girl I won't mind
To start all this, all over
Without no vision or way of how love's supposed to be
See back then I was so young but now I'm much older
And I won't make the mistakes bein' I just couldn't see
I'm thinkin' that we need a harmony
It seems like it's the perfect harmony
I'll gently take your hand and try this love thing once again
Gotta take our time and share each moment, day and night
Or else it just slips away, slips away, oh slips away, slips away
So are you willing to start all this all over?
With several visions and ways of how love's supposed to be
See back then I was so young but now I'm much older
And just won't make the mistakes bein' I just couldn't see
For this here I may need a harmony
You help me make the perfect harmony
To feel a new touch, to smell a new scent
To learn a new love, the kiss of new lips
