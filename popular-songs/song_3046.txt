If you see him
Tell him I wish him well
How am I doing?
Well, sometimes is hard to tell
I still miss him more than ever
But please dont say a word
If you see him
If you see him
If you see her
Tell her I'm doing fine
And if you want to
Say that I think of her from time to time
Ask her if she ever wonders
Where we both went wrong
If you see her
If you see her
I still want her
I still need him so
I dont know why we let each other go
If you see her
Tell her the lights still on for her
Nothing's changed 
Deep down the fire still burns for him
And even if it takes forever say I'll still be here
If you see him
If you see her
If you see him
If you see her
