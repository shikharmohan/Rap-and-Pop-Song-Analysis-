Twilight shadows gather 'round my door
They find me dreaming all alone once more
Memories come 'round to haunt my sleepless sounds
Now's the time I must be strong
I believe it won't be long
Till love comes again
To end these lonely nights
Till love comes again
To drive these tears I cry
It's darkest just before the dawn
And I'll just keep holding on
Till then
Till love comes again
Somewhere someone feels the way I do
And like me they dream of the love that's true
One day I'll look into his eyes, I'll know the moment's right
Until then I'll just wait
No matter how long it might take
Till love comes again
To end these lonely nights
Till love comes again
To drive these tears I cry
It's darkest just before the dawn
And I'll just keep holding on
Till then
Till love comes again
Oh! Until then
Till love comes again
