Preacher told me last Sunday mornin'
Son, you better start livin' right
You need to quit the women and whiskey
And carrying on all night
Don't you wanna hear him call your name
When you're standin' at the pearly gates?
I told the preacher, "Yes I do
But I hope they don't call today
I ain't ready"
Everybody wants to go to heaven
Have a mansion high above the clouds
Everybody want to go to heaven
But nobody want to go now
I said, "Preacher maybe you didn't see me
Throw an extra twenty in the plate
There's one for everything I did last night
And one to get me through today"
"Here's a ten to help you remember
Next time you got the good Lord's ear
Say I'm comin' but there ain't no hurry
I'm havin' fun down here"
Don't you know that
Everybody wants to go to heaven
Get their wings and fly around
Everybody want to go to heaven
But nobody want to go now
Someday I want to see those
Streets of gold in my halo
But I wouldn't mind waiting at least
A hundred years or so
Everybody wanna go to heaven
It beats the other place there ain't no doubt
Everybody wanna go to heaven
But nobody wanna go now
Everybody wanna go to heaven
Hallelujah, let me hear you shout
Everybody wanna go to heaven
But nobody wanna go now
I think I speak for the crowd
Nobody want to go now
