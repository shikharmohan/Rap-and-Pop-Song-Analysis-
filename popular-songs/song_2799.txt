(steve bogard, rick giles)
When you ain't got nobody, then nobody ever says goodbye.
You don't have to wait for someone to
Make you laugh or make you cry
Wish I were only lonely.
Just kind of ordinary blue.
If I were only lonely then maybe I'd know what to do.
But I'm helpless cause I'm lonely for you.
I sleep in a bed so empty,
It's an emptiness no one can fill.
I may have to go on living,
But life without you ain't no thrill.
Repeat chorus
