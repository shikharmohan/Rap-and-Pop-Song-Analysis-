Yeah (young money!) 
Back like I left somethin' 
Omarion
So I got this situation 
My girl's been hangin out With this other girl 
Let me talk about it 
Where is my girlfriend? 
I been callin' 
She aint picked up 
Somethings fishy 
She won't hear me 
Now i'm sittin' here 
Like what the fuck? 
This is too unusual 
She never did it like this before 
She usually calls me back within the hour 
I bet she's out with whats her name 
The girl that doesn't have a man 
Assumptions in my mind got me confused girl 
Sometimes she can't keep a pretty hands(?) off me 
But when shes with her girlfriend she don't even speak 
She could spot a pretty girl faster than I can 
Tells me that she loves me but I'm tryna' understand 
(3X) 
I think my girl is.. 
Bi Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay 
Should I say goodbye? 
Should I give it a try? 
I think my girl is...
Secret conversations in my face
They talking code
Matchin tattoos, to the bathroom
At the same time they go
This is too unusually
Never been like this before 
Affection aint the same when sheÃÂ¢€s around her
I wonder if im trippin
Visions of them kissin
Now I wanna know the truth cuzÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦.
