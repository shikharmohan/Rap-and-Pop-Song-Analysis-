There were nights where I was sure I wouldn't see the mornin' sun
And there were days that seemed so dark
I couldn't wait for night to come
I couldn't stand to think about how my life used to be
And how without a single warnin' it all slipped away from me
Like a fool I thought that I could fight the shadows on my own
To the dark I was no stranger, this was stronger than I know
By the time I knew that I was in too deep I'd gone too far
And the light that used to guide me had faded from my heart
And I found myself in places I thought I'd never go
Surrounded by strangers I was so far from home
And I don't know how you found me
All I know is I owe everything to you, yes I do
And I thank you for my heart, I thank you for my life
And I thank God for grace and mercy and that you became my wife
I'm seein' for the first time the stars, the sun and moon
But they've got nothin' on the power of this love I have for you
And I thank you, I thank you
People say they'll stand beside you, swear they'll never leave
When the rain started fallin' you know it only fell on me
It was hard to keep believin' in myself when all I felt was so much pain
And getting ashamed I couldn't even ask for help
I don't know if I believe in other lives but when you came
There was somethin' so familiar about the way you said my name
And the whole world started turnin'
And I swear that I'd been born again brand new
And it's all because of you
And so I thank you for my heart, I thank you for my life
And I thank God for grace and mercy and that you became my wife
I'm seein' for the first time the stars, the sun and moon
But they've got nothin' on the power of this love I have for you
And I thank you
And I've seen so many things that I just can't explain
But the miracle of miracles is how with your love I was saved
And I thank you
I thank you for my life
I thank God for grace and mercy and that you became my wife
And I'm seein' for the first time the stars the sun and moon
But they've got nothin' on the power of all this love I give to you
And I thank you for my heart, I thank you for my life
I thank God for grace and mercy and that you became my wife
The day I started breathing was the day you took my hand
And 'til the day I die baby I'll forever be your man
And I thank you, I thank you
Yes, I do
Don't you know I thank you?
