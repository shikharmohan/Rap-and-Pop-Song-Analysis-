I just walked in and you were gone
To your mama's I suppose
It looks like you won't be back
So I thought you ought to know
I found that note you left today
It only took you half the page
I'm gonna grab my old guitar
Take a pencil from the jar, fill in the empty space
I'm gon' tell you how I feel
Straight up, genuine and real
Open a bottle of 90 proof
And write a song for you
Like Kristofferson would do
In each line you're gonna hear
It's my fault and I miss you
I know it won't be in time, it may not even rhyme
But all it has to be is true
I'm gon' tell you how I feel
Straight up genuine and real
Open a bottle of 90 proof
And write a song for you
Like Kristofferson would do
Oh, here it goes, hey
Yeah, I'm gon' tell you how I feel
Straight up, genuine and real
Open a bottle of 90 proof
And write a song for you
Like Kristofferson would do
I'm gon' drink this bottle of 90 proof
And sing a song for you
Like Kristofferson would do
