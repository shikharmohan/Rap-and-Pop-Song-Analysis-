Love doesn't come with a contract
You give me this, I give you that
It's scary business, your heart and soul is on the line
Baby, why else would I be standing 'round here so tongue-tied
If I knew what I was doing, I'd be doing it right now
I would be the best damn poet, silver words out of my mouth
My words might not be magic but they cut straight to the truth
So if you need a lover and a friend
Baby, I'm in, I'm in, baby, I'm in, I'm in
Baby, come on in, the water's fine
I'll be right here, you take your time
Just let me hold you and we'll both take that leap of faith
It's like I told you there's no guarantee when you feel this way
If I knew what I was doing, I'd be doing it right now
I would be the best damn poet, silver words out of my mouth
My words might not be magic but they cut straight to the truth
So if you need a lover and a friend
Baby, I'm in, I'm in
Baby, come here next to me
I'll show you how good it can be
I'll breathe each breath you breathe I can
Pour out everything I am
If I knew what I was doing, I'd be doing it right now
I would be the best damn poet, silver words out of my mouth
My words might not be magic but they cut straight to the truth
So if you need a lover and a friend
If you need a lover and a friend
Baby, I'm , baby, I'm in, I'm in, baby I'm in, I'm in
Baby, come here next to me
I'll show you how good it can be
I'll breathe each breath you breathe I can
Pour out everything I am
Baby, come here next to me
I'll show you how good it can be
I'll breathe each breath you breathe I can
Pour out everything I am
Baby, I'm in
I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in
Baby, come here next to me
I'll show you how good it can be
[Incomprehensible]
I'm in, I'm in
