Look at this stuff, isn't it neat?
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl
The girl who has everything?
Look at this trove, treasures untold
How many wonders can one cavern hold?
Lookin' around here you'd think
Sure, she's got everything
I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty
I've got whozits and whatzits galore
You want thingamabobs? I got twenty
But who cares? No big deal, I want more
I wanna be where the people are
I wanna see, wanna see them dancin'
Walkin' around on those
Whad'ya call 'em? Oh feet
Flippin' your fins you don't get too far
Legs are required for jumpin', dancin'
Strollin' along down a
What's that word again? Street
Up where they walk, up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wanderin' free, wish I could be part of that world
What would I give if I could live
Outta these waters?
What would I pay to spend a day
Warm on the sand?
Betcha on land they understand
That they don't reprimand their daughters
Bright, young women sick o' swimmin'
Ready to stand
I'm ready to know what the people know
Ask 'em my questions and get some answers
What's a fire and why does it
What's the word? Burn
When's it my turn?
When's it my turn to be
Up where they walk, up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wanderin' free, wish I could be part of that world?
Up where they walk, up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wanderin' free, wish I could be part of that world
