I might bite my lip
Look down at my shoes
I might clench my fist 
Or just leave the room
Chorus:
But I'm not gonna cry 
Not one single drop
Cause once i get started, I
I may never stop
I might even laugh 
Right in your face
When you come out and ask
Oh if I'll be okay
Chorus:
But I'm not gonna cry 
Not one single drop
Cause once I get started, I
I may never stop
Its gonna take and act of God and all I got 
To keep the first tear from fallin' down 
But if I don't hold the waters back the dam is gonna crack
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna drown 
So I'm not gonna cry
If that's what you thought
Cause once i get started, I
I may never stop
No im not gonna cry
Not one single drop
Cause once i get start, I
I may never stop
So I might bite my lip, Look down at my shoes
