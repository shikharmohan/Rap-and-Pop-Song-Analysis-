[Intro]
Now you know that i'll never give you anything that will hurt you right baby
So try this
Yeah

[Chorus]
[Liz Suwandi]
I saw you back where we began
Then you took me for a spin
And Captivated brought me in and now
See I still watch you from a distance
Lost in you lose all resistance
Poisonous the way you took me out
Cause ahh you-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh got the best, of me
Cause ahh you-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh got the best, of me
[Verse]

Nina
Im like a walking drug
I can make your lady pop X
Want sex from a nigga like me
I can feel her nightly
Even make her fall off in love
Get away lost off in hugs
Stalkin blood for an awesome plug
This is addictive
Vicious and wicked slick talkin stud
I take good gals
Recruit um, pollute um
Put X in they wood valve
To shoot um
They chewed um up and true enough
They would be poppin, droppin, pursuin us
Plus screwin the crew an such
A ruined slut livin through a nut
That was then but now I see um
They be on the same shit
Brainless
Itchin to get that quick trip wanna be painless
I dont f**k wit it no more that I can arrange it
I was like Dracula attackin her when I give her game
Hella vein language
It was they choice to trip
I kept her moist and slick
Now shes an annoying chick
I started avoiding Ms.
Give her them toys and split
I polluted so many women with bad habits and drugs
I guess im poisonous
[Chorus]
[Liz Suwandi]
I saw you back where we began
Then you took me for a spin
And Captivated brought me in and now
See I still watch you from a distance
Lost in you lose all resistance
Poisonous the way you took me out
Cause ahh you-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh got the best of me
Cause ahh you-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh got the best of me
