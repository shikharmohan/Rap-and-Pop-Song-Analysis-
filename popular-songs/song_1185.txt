I don't know what it was about her 'cause she's still all my mind
So why wouldn't I could keep her but waiting here is just fine
'Cause I know someday, she'll come my way
And soon the sun will shine
And if I ever lose my heart, I'd lose it to a girl like that
And if I'm going to save all my love
I'd save it for the day she comes back
And if I ever lose my heart, I'd lose it to a girl like that
And she can wrap the world in a river's mate
The stars are string of pearls
With the colors of the sunset, she takes me round the world
Now every night, inside of [Unverified]
I am sending her my love out there
And if I ever lose my heart, I'd lose it to a girl like that
And if I'm going to save all my love,
I'd save it for the day she comes back,
And if I ever lose my heart, I'd lose it to a girl like that
Though I know she's gone
Maybe dreams just can't be wrong
'Cause no one else on Earth
That makes me feel, the way I feel with her
And if I ever lose my heart
(Lose my heart)
I'd lose it to a girl like that
(Girl like that)
And if I'm going to save all my love
I'd save it for the day she comes back
And if I ever lose my heart, I'd lose it to a girl like that
Yeah, if I ever lose me heart
I would lose it to a girl like, a girl like that
