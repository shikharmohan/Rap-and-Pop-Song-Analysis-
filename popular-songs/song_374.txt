There's a place where love grows wild
Where hearts can trust just like a child
A wild thing, it don't need a lot
It just grows on what it's it got
It still grows no matter what
I used to be too hard to care
But till you do, you ain't nowhere
Once I just threw love away
But that fool was yesterday
Now my heart is home to stay
Wild things grow on less than a little
And darling I know it'll be
You and me right down in the middle
Where love grows wild
Gave up all those valentines
Now I just want the one that's mine
I will say I love you so
When I do it, you will know
Darling I will never go
Wild things grow on less than a little
And darling I know it'll be
You and me right down in the middle
Where love grows wild
You give me the sweetest love
You must be straight from above
And you're so good at loving me
You're so fine, it's plain to see
This was surely meant to be
Wild things grow on less than a little
And darling I know it'll be
You and me right down in the middle
Where love grows wild
There's a place where love grows wild
