It's six Monday morning, she's back into her routine
Kicks off the covers and thinks about last night's dream
Shower and coffee, she heads for the train
Thinkin' how every day's the same
There's gotta be more than a life on her own
All that she wants is a man to come home to
She's lookin' for someone to love her and stay forever true
Just somebody who she can believe in and say they need her too
She's lookin' for someone to hold her until the light of day
Somebody she can make future plans with and know he's here to stay
Late in the evening she is dreamin' in black and white
An old love story she wishes portrayed her life
No one would know what goes on in her mind
Thinkin' it's only a matter of time
Til' someday she finds what she's lookin' for
And her ship will come sailin' into her shore
She's lookin' for someone to love her and stay forever true
Just somebody who she can believe in and say they need her too
She's lookin' for someone to hold her until the light of day
Somebody she can make future plans with and know he's here to stay
She's lookin' for someone to love her
(Oh, someone to love her)
And stay forever true
(Oh, no)
Just somebody who she can believe in
And say they need her too
(Someone who needs her too)
She's lookin' for someone to hold her
Until the light of day
(Oh, until the light of day)
Somebody she can make future plans with
And know he's here to stay
