I would have waited forever
If I'd known that you'd be here
We could have shared our lives together
And held each other close all through the years
But I've met someone before you
And my heart just couldn't wait
So no matter how much I adore you
I've got to stand behind the promise that I made
Where were you, when I could have loved you?
Where were you, when I gave my heart away?
All my life, I've been dreamin' of you
You came along one promise too late
You came along one promise too late
I won't say that I'm sorry that I met you
I can't have you but I never will forget you
Where were you, when I could have loved you?
Where were you, when I gave my heart away?
All my life, I've been dreamin' of you
You came along one promise too late
You came along one promise too late
Where were you, when I could have loved you?
Where were you, when I gave my heart away?
All my life that I've been dreamin' of you
You came along one promise too late
You came along one promise too late
