Ol' Joe's got a Boston Whaler he bought in Key Biscayne
And he swears that since the day he got her
She's been nothing but a pain
When the sun's at his back and the wind's in his face
It's just him and the wheel
He wouldn't take a million for the way it makes him feel
Boats
Vessels of freedom
Harbors of healing
Boats
Newport is where John hung his hat till he lost his wife Joan
Now forty feet of sail antique is where Ol' John calls home
He watched his life pass before his eyes in the middle of a hurricane
Came out alive on the other side, that's where the other side got its name
Boats
Vessels of freedom
Harbors of heeling
Boats
Twenty years of a landlocked job was all that Tom could take
Sitting at his desk alone and depressed, says, this just can't be my fate
Went home that night and told his wife you can tell all your friends
It's been real but it ain't been fun, gonna get us one of them
Boats
Vessels of freedom
Harbors of healing
Boats
Vessels of freedom
