the rains coming down hard tonite,
pull the car over
now im sittin alone on the roadside
i tilt the mirror down and say to me,
why you always think the answers gotta be,
to just leave
im making the same mistake
im hoping its not too late
because i
(chorus)
i dont know where id be without you now
i guess i get scared and thats why i act like
such a fool
cause youre the one thing i cant lose
i feel the tears coming 
and i wanna cry
i think of us baby 
and all the love inside comes shining through
and it always leads me right on back to you
i never felt it,
i never knew
someone who could get inside my soul the way you do,
yes you do
yeah you got me in the palm of your hands
its beautiful and terrifying,
cant you see
for someone like me
but instead of running in,
i know
its when i should hold you closer
because i
(chorus)
i dont know where id be without you now
i guess i get scared and thats why i act like
such a fool
cause youre the one thing i cant lose
i feel the tears coming 
and i wanna cry
i think of us baby 
and all the love inside comes shining through
and it always leads me right on back to you
cause nobodys ever loved me 
like you
and i was born to be your man forever
forever baby
yeah 
i feel the tears coming 
and i wanna cry
i turn the car around
and put it in drive
and i know what to do
gonna come on back, 
come on back to you
yeah
oh, oh baby
gonna come on back,
come on back to you
cause i cant live without you,
i cant breathe without you
yeah
and im nothin, im nothin
without you
yeah
i was a fool, i was a fool baby
