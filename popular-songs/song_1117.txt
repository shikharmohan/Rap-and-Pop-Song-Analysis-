So you're leaving in the morning
On the early train
I could say everything's alright
And I could pretend and say goodbye
You got your ticket, got your suitcase
You got your leaving smile
I could say that's the way it goes
I could pretend and you won't know that I was lying
'Cuz I can't stop loving you
I can't stop loving you
No, I can't stop loving you
Though I tried
We took a taxi to the station
And not a word was said, no
I saw you walk across the road
For maybe the last time I don't know
I'm feeling humble, I heard a rumble
On the railway tracks
And when I hear that whistle blow
I walked away and you won't know that I was crying
'Cuz I can't stop loving you
No, I can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
Though I tried
I just can't stop loving you
No, I can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
Why do I try? Why do I try?
Oh, yeah
