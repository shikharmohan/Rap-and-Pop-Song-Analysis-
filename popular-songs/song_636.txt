When I sleep, I have dreams
About the way we used to kiss
About the way you used to hold me
And say nothin' would ever harm me
When we first met, oh how you charmed me
Made me smile when I was down
Big pimpin' around the town, you and me
Whenever they'd see you, they'd see me
A lover and a friend to me you were
How did it end? How it hurts
To not have you in my life
When I wanted to be your wife
You never know what you have till it's gone
Treated you wrong for so long
Now you're gone away
But the love still lives here
Still, I still got love for you
Still, after all we've been through
Still, I gave my heart to you
And baby, you're the only one
There's other men than you
Still, they can come close to you
Still, once I said I love you
I knew you'd be the only one
A good man you were to me, always there to care
Would do anything in this world for me
Didn't matter, what, when, or where
You were there
I never thought we'd part
From the arguments we'd start
When I just wanted some attention
And I'm sorry baby for bitchin'
If I could take back the words
That I said to make you leave
I'd be down on bended knees
Asking you to please forgive me
You never know what you have till it's gone
Treated you wrong for so long
Now you're gone away
But the love still lives here
Still, I still got love for you
Still, after all we've been through
Still, I gave my heart to you
And baby, you're the only one
There's other men than you
Still, they can come close to you
Still, once I said I love you
I knew you'd be the only one
All of the good times we had together
Do they mean something to you
Do you ever wish we never split
'Cause I still got love for you
Still, I still got love for you
Still, after all we've been through
Still, I gave my heart to you
And baby, you're the only one
There's other men than you
Still, they can come close to you
Still, once I said I love you
I knew you'd be the only one
Still, I still got love for you
Still, after all we've been through
Still, I gave my heart to you
And baby, you're the only one
There's other men than you
Still, they can come close to you
Still, once I said I love you
I knew you'd be the only one
