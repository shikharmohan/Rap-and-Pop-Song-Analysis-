So may I have your attention? Look in my  direction
Here you'll see the sun never says no
We don't have to worry, never in a hurry
One by on the stars go to bed
And I step into the spotlight again
Can't help myself I gotta be where the lights are shinning down on me
I wanna feel the sun
So turn that walk into a run, gonna bring the party when I come
Sing out if you wanna have some fun
And into the spotlight we will go, follow me 'cause baby life's a show
And into the spotlight you will see it's the only place to be
Oh, music's like a magnet, the best thing on the planet
It's pulling us together again
So let's cause a commotion, sound waves on the ocean
Wake the moon and grab your best friend
Let's step into the spotlight again
Can't help myself I gotta be where the lights are shinning down on me
I wanna feel the sun
So turn that walk into a run, gonna bring the party when I come
Sing out if you wanna have some fun
And into the spotlight we will go, follow me 'cause baby life's a show
And into the spotlight you will see it's the only place to be
Turn it up if you're downhearted
Let the music get us started
Gotta let it go once in a while
Turn it up, there's nothing to it
When it's done we'll just redo it
Might as well have fun have fun in this life
Can't help myself I gotta be where the lights are shinning down on me
I wanna feel the sun
So turn that walk into a run, gonna bring the party when I come
Sing out if you wanna have some fun
Can't help myself I gotta be where the lights are shinning down on me
I wanna feel the sun
So turn that walk into a run, gonna bring the party when I come
Sing out if you wanna have some fun
And into the spotlight we will go, follow me 'cause baby life's a show
And into the spotlight you will see it's the only place to be
Yeah, into the spotlight you will see it's the only place for me
