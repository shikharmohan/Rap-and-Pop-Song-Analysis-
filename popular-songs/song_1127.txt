I know it's gonna take some time
For you to trust this love of mine
I know he broke your heart in two
You've been betrayed and your afraid
That I will do the same to you
But you'll be safe here in my arms forever and a day
Though you don't believe me now, I'll never walk away
You, you know that I'll be there, when tomorrow comes
(You're the only one)
I know you've heard this all before
(You're the only one)
You're the one that I adore
(You're the only one)
You make me shine just like the sun
(You're the only one)
You bring this heart of mine undone
(You're the only one)
For every lie you've ever heard
You can believe my every word, yes, you can
Whatever heaven holds in store
Through good and bad, I'll be your man
Stand beside you through it all
But you'll be safe here in my arms, forever and a day
Though you don't believe me now, I'll never walk away
And you, you know that I'll be there, when tomorrow comes
(You're the only one)
I know you've heard this all before
(You're the only one)
You're the one that I adore
(You're the only one)
You make me shine just like the sun
(You're the only one)
You bring this heart of mine undone
(You're the only one)
I know you've heard this all before
(You're the only one)
But you're the one that I adore
(You're the only one)
You make me shine just like the sun
(You're the only one)
You bring this heart of mine undone
(You're the only one)
(You're the only one)
Make me shine just like the sun, yes you do
(You're the only one)
