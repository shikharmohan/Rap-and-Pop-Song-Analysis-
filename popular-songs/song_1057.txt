In the night I hear 'em talk,
The coldest story ever told,
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless...
How could you be so heartless... oh
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so,
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo
Just remember that you talking to me yo
You need to watch the way you talking to me you know
I mean after all the things that we been through
I mean after all the things we got into
And yo I know of some things that you ain't told me
And yo I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back
And you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend
Well I got homies
But in the end it's still so lonely
In the night I hear 'em talk,
The coldest story ever told,
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless...
How could you be so heartless... oh
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so Dr. Evil
You're bringing out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we weren't gonna speak so why we up 3 a.m. on the phone
Why does she be so mad at me for, homie I don't know she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up cause I already know how this thing goes,
You run and tell your friends that you're leavin' me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple months then you gon' see,
You'll never find nobody better than me
In the night I hear 'em talk,
The coldest story ever told,
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless...
How could you be so heartless... oh
How could you be so heartless?
Talkin', talkin', talkin', talk,
Baby lets just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got something new to see
And you just gon' keep hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
and you can't make it right
Im gon' take off tonight
Into the night...
In the night I hear 'em talk,
The coldest story ever told,
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless...
How could you be so heartless... oh
How could you be so heartless? 
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be sooooo

In the night I hear 'em talk,
The coldest story ever told,
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman sooo
Woman soooo

There is no Gucci I could buy
There is no Louis vuitton to put on
There is no YSL that they could sell
To take my mind out of this hill
And my heart out of this jail
There is no clothes that I could buy
That could turn back the time
There is no vacation spot I could fly
That could turn back a piece of real real life
I ask you tonight what does it feel like?
What does it feel like? I ask you tonight, 
What does it feel like
To live a real life
I just want to be a real boy
Pinocchio story goes to be a real boy
People say you keep it to real boy

Is it my fault that I make you heartless

But regardless that I give you the reason 
To act retarded yeah we fall but you started
You started no no no no
Nobody knows, nobody knows

You say thing sometimes that you just can take back
Take back, tack back
You gonna hit me one day
So take that, so take that
And thats something you just cant take back, take back
Take back never do nothing you cant take back, take back
Does this hurtful comment have a receipt 
Does this staggering piece of truth that was never told 
Have an expiration date 
When iii lay down in my bed
The voices in my head 
When another woman is beside me in my bed
In the night I hear 'em talk,
The coldest story ever told,
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman soooo heartless
How could you be soo heartless
Did I make you be heartless
Did I make you be heartless

Singing on the ground
With my pink shirt on
Does this look gay to you
Well i don't now what'lls to say to you
Look at me now
I'm on the ground
And my heart can still not be found
Couse i looked all around 
And my heart well never be found 
I looked all around 
And my heart no where to be found 
Where is my heart right now 
With a woman soooo heartless 
How could you be soo 
How could you be soooo heartless

In the night I hear em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
I lost my soul 
To somebody so heartless
