I've been so many places, I've seen so many things
I've seen so many faces, been called so many names
Kept getting into fights just for staying in the lane
Life's full of adversities, you will if you stay the same
Never thought in a million years I would blow up
And be the one that carries the hood on the shoulder
Now I'm the CEO, call me the owner
And I can do anything that I wanna
I can live with and I rather be flying high
And I'd be gone
You can call me Hollywood
And tip my heart and see my home
And you see
A little G to the H, E to the T
T to the O, now tell me what you see
I'm just Ghetto, I'm just me, I'm just me
A little G to the H, E to the T
T to the O, now tell me what you see
I'm just Ghetto, I'm just me, I'm just me
Listen, now when I'm going home, you're screaming do your thing
Doing commercials now, I'm on the movie screen
And all my fans are going out to buy my magazine
Color to color, I'm being discovered
Never thought in a million years I would blow up
And be the one that carries the hood on the shoulder
Now I'm the CEO, call me the owner
And I can do anything that I wanna
They said that I would try so hard
To change my way
You can call me Hollywood
'Cause in my heart I'm not the same
A little G to the H, E to the T
T to the O, now tell me what you see
I'm just Ghetto, I'm just me, I'm just me
A little G to the H, E to the T
T to the O, now tell me what you see
I'm just Ghetto, I'm just me, I'm just me
It doesn't matter what you do
Do you really always shine like blue?
Who you are, it's what's going to get you far in life
It's what's inside
Riding high, it's alright, hold on
Because it's time for you to live your life
You know what I believe
I believe life is what you make it
Never thought in a million years I would blow up
And be the one that carries the hood on the shoulder
Now I'm the CEO, call me the owner
And I can do anything that I wanna
A little G to the H, E to the T
T to the O, now tell me what you see
I'm just Ghetto, I'm just me, I'm just me
A little G to the H, E to the T
T to the O, now tell me what you see
I'm just Ghetto, I'm just me, I'm just me
It doesn't matter what you do
Do you really always shine like blue?
Who you are, it's what's going to get you far in life
It's what's inside
Riding high, it's alright, hold on
Because it's time for you to live your life
A little G to the H, E to the T
T to the O, now tell me what you see
I'm just Ghetto, I'm just me, I'm just me
A little G to the H, E to the T
T to the O, now tell me what you see
I'm just Ghetto, I'm just me, I'm just me
