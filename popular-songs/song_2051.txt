verse 1:
said well i don't kno what yall been told
but there aint many
house wives that once was hoes
do we normally happen that way
the answer is no
so what u tryna test it for
and so u met her in a club
rubbin on u cus of who u thought she was
she put it on you thats wassup
but now your talkin bout how your in love
well if she was trickin when you met her
what makes you think that she aint trickin now
and if she had a boyfriend when y'all hooked up
what makes you think that she wont mess around
its just common sense
think about it, bout it
think about it, bout it
think about, about it
its just common sense
think about it, bout it
think about it, bout it
think about, about it
girl i don't kno what you dreamin bout
how you are happy
because your with him now
but he left her to be with u
and baby girl i strongly doubt
that with you he gon take a different route
he come n see u every day
smellin like them vicky secret body spray
girl u kno
either he creepin or he gay
baby that aint nothin u need either way
well if he was trickin when you met him
what makes you think that he aint trickin now
and if he had a girlfriend when yall hooked up
what makes you think that he wont mess around
its just common sense
think about it, bout it
think about it, bout it
think about, about it
its just common sense
think about it, bout it
think about it, bout it
think about, about it
