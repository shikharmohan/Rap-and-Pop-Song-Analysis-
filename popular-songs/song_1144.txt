When God made woman
When God made woman
It never ceases to blow my mind
It does it to me every time
Standin' here lookin' at you, it makes me wonder what He was up to
Was He thinking 'bout me when He thought about you?
When God made woman He must've been proud
Yeah, He must've been crying or laughing out loud
It must have felt like the first time gettin' kissed by the sun
When God made woman
It must have been the most beautiful day
Lookin' down on all creation
He took a river that winds and turns, He took a fire that breathes and burns
And put it all in place in the most perfect way
When God made woman He must've been proud
Yeah, He must've been crying or laughing out loud
It must have felt like the first time gettin' kissed by the sun
When God made woman
When God made woman He must've been proud
Yeah, He must've been crying or laughing out loud
It must have felt like the first time gettin' kissed by the sun
When God made woman
God made woman, yeah, yeah
