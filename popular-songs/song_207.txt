It's time to make a difference, I know he's bad, right now I'm feelin'
Like I need him in my life, I don't wanna leave him, he's my best friend
And he, without him, I can't see us breakin' up, people said
It wouldn't work, I'd end up gettin' hurt but what do they know
Because he's my man, I don't care what people say
'Cause this feels good to me and I don't want him to leave
It's crazy, tell me how come somethin' I really want
Somethin' I love is so bad for me, I can't explain it
It's just like a bad habit, I can't shake it, so crazy, crazy, crazy
I can't believe it, how I need him, he makes a difference
Y'all I'm trippin', it's crazy, don't know which way to go
Can't let him go, even though I know he ain't the one for me
Stay in some drama, can't take him home to momma
I'ma be honest, he a cold playa, flirts with every girl that he meets
How he do that to me? How he make it not better? So charmin'
And clever, he can get whatever he ask me for I'm talking 'bout
Somethin' I can't do without, I can't find the strength to leave
'Cause this feel good to me and I don't want him to leave
It's crazy, tell me how come somethin' I really want
Somethin' I love is so bad for me, I can't explain it
It's just like a bad habit, I can't shake it, so crazy, crazy, crazy
I can't believe it, how I need him, he makes a difference
Y'all I'm trippin', it's crazy, I don't know which way to go
Can't let him go, even though I know he ain't the one for me
Tonight if this ain't smart 'cause he'll probably break my heart
But he's the best thing in a while that's ever happen to me
I don't care what all the other people say, don't want him to go away
I'm hopin' that he stays right here with me, it's so crazy
It's crazy, tell me how come somethin' I really want
Somethin' I love is so bad for me, I can't explain it
It's just like a bad habit, I can't shake it, so crazy, crazy, crazy
I can't believe it, how I need him, he makes a difference
Y'all I'm trippin', it's crazy, don't know which way to go
Can't let him go, even though I know he ain't the one for me
It's crazy, tell me how come somethin' I really want
Somethin' I love is so bad for me, I can't explain it
It's just like a bad habit, I can't shake it, so crazy, crazy, crazy
I can't believe it, how I need him, he makes a difference
Y'all I'm trippin', it's crazy, don't know which way to go
Can't let him go, even though I know he ain't the one for me
