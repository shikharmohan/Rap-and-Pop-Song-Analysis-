She said, "You never tell me
That you love me anymore
So I can't help but wonder if you do"
She said, "If things don't change
You'll see me walk right out that door
'Cause I've done everything I know to do"
I said, "I don't know just
What it is you want from me"
She said, "I only want us back
The way we used to be"
Then she said, "Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
Hold me, hold me like you want me
Like you'll never let me go"
She said, "Show me, show me
That you really love me
And then tell me 'cause I really need to know"
She said, "Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me"
I got down on my knee right there
And I promised her I'd change
'Cause deep inside I knew that she was right
I said, "I know we've drifted
And there's only me to blame
But I don't want to waste another night"
Somewhere in the darkness there
We found a brand new start
As I took every word
She whispered straight into heart
She said, "Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
Hold me, hold me like you want me
Like you'll never let me go"
She said, "Show me, show me
That you really love me
And then tell me 'cause I really need to know"
She said, "Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
Kiss me"
