How come you don't make time for me anymore?
That's the last thing she said to you
And now when you call she don't answer any more
Or the line is busy and you can't get through
In the time it would take you to learn from your mistakes
In the time it would take to dial the phone
In the time it would take you to realize her greatness, she'll be gone
She's moved on to someone who takes the time
Her love wasn't a priority to you
You had other things on your mind
And now that it's much too little and so far away
The busy signals all that's left behind, you're all alone
In the time it would take you to learn from your mistakes
In the time it would take to dial the phone
In the time it would take you to realize her greatness she'll be gone
She's moved on to someone who takes the time
Hey, no one knows what they have until they don't
And by then it doesn't matter any more, you're all alone
In the time it would take you to learn from your mistakes
In the time it would take to dial the phone
In the time it would take you to realize her greatness she'll be gone
She'll be gone
In the time it would take for you to realize her greatness, she'll be gone
She's moved on hang up the phone
