I would never bother you
I would never promise to
I would never bother you
I would never promise to
If i say that word again
I would move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear
You won't be afraid of fear
You won't be afraid of fear
I am walking in the piss
Always knew it would come to this
Things have never been so swell
And i have never felt so
Hey, hey, hey
You know you're right
You know you're right
You know you're right
It's cold now come inside
I no longer have to hide
Let's talk about someone else
She just wants to love herself
She moves away from here
She just wants to love herself
I won't move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear
I won't move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear
I am walking in the piss
Always knew it would come to this
Things have never been so swell
And i have never been so well
You know you're right you know you're right
You know you're right maybe you're right...
