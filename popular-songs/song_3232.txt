Bianca's and Beatrice's are known for wetting matrices
And bending over in the ill positions
Bianca's and Beatrice's, they love the way I'm rapping this
I dig 'em then I plug 'em and I diss 'em
I'm kickin' it with this chick up in the club I'm off the lou
And when you're on that caribou you know just what to do
I called her Bianca then she said, what is that Bianca shit
I looked and cracked a smile and said, Bianca means you bitch
You're a biank baby, whether you like it or not
But you hot especially with ex and vicaden popped
If you trippin' you can hike it and hop 'cause you know what I came to do
Me and my villains come to strike it and stop
Pipe it and prop ya leg up and get up
Bianca hold ya head up your sex wet the bed up
Everybody's pondering wondering about my slang that I spit
You can use it when you refer to a dame or a chick
Don't be trippin' about the choice of words I'm using on this script
Don't step off in my face 'cause you can bet that I come equipped
You wanna know what you say, to get that biank to let you blend
(What)
Hotel, motel, holiday inn
