City side walks, busy side walks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear
Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring a ling hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day
Strings of street lights, even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures
Hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch
This is Santa's big seen
And above all the bustle you'll hear
Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring a ling hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day
Soon it will be Christmas day
Christmas day
Silver bells, silver bells, silver bells
