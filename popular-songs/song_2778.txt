(Reba McEntire with Asleep At The Wheel)
Right or wrong I'll always love you
Though you're gone - I can't forget
Right or wrong I'll keep on dreaming
Still I wake with that same ol' regret
And all along I thought I'd lose you
And still I prayed that you'd be true
In your heart please just remember
Right or wrong I'm still in love with you
Ahhh-haaaw!
Oh, play it for me
Oh, yeah!
Oh, right or wrong I'll always love you
Though you're gone I can't forget
Right or wrong I'll keep on dreamin'
Still I wake with the some ol' regrets
And all along I thought I'd lose you
And still I prayed that you'd be true, Lord, Lord
In your heart, please just remember
Right or wrong I'm still in love with you--oh-oh, oh, oh
