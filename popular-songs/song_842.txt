Mafia 
The love the love is
Bigga
The love the love is
Bigga
The love the love is
Bigga
Big
Gotta believe in me 
Believe me like a fairy-tale
The truth I need pillowcase
No I won't, I won't
Ever ever let you down (No)
Like a Seasaw lets you  down (oh)
You know why
Cuz we ain't on the playground no more baby
We're big enough 
to stand in the picture
We're big enough 
to stand next to love
I was a playa
when I was little 
but I'm bigga
I'm bigga
A heart-breaker
when I was little
but I'm bigga
I'm bigga
And all the hitters
I swear they're so small from up here
Cuz we're bigga, 
and love's bigga, 
I'm bigga and you're bigga
Whoa oh
remember when my heart was young
It was still bigga then me (bigga than me)
Is that the reason that you stayed
Most would've got rid of me
Now the bullies in the school yard
Can't take our hugs and our kisses from us (No!)
Because we ain't push-overs no more, baby
We're big enough
to stand in the picture
We're big enough
to stand next to love
I was a playa
when I was little 
but I'm bigga 
I'm bigga
A heart-breaker
when I was little
but I'm bigga
I'm bigga
And all the hitters
I swear they're so small from up here
Cuz we're bigga,
and love's bigga, 
I'm bigga and you're bigga
I was a playa
when I was little 
but I'm bigga 
I'm bigga
A heart-breaker
when I was little
but I'm bigga
I'm bigga
And all the hitters
I swear they look so small from up here
Cuz we're bigga, 
and love's bigga, 
I'm bigga and you're bigga
(Remember those stroll down street) I remember that
(Don't knock ya earrings) Like Yesterday
(They shine on me) They were little then
(In class I dreamed about you) My baby
You wow wow (You wow wow)
Since then all I can remember is the love only got Bigga
I was a playa
when I was little 
but I'm bigga
I'm bigga
A heart-breaker
when I was little
but I'm bigga
I'm bigga
And all the hitters
I swear they're so small from up here
Cuz we're bigga, 
and love's bigga, 
I'm bigga and you're bigga
I was a playa
when I was little 
but I'm bigga
I'm bigga
A heart-breaker
when I was little
but I'm bigga
I'm bigga
And all the hitters
I swear they're so small from up here
Cuz we're bigga, 
and love's bigga, 
I'm bigga and you're bigga
