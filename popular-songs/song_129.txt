Eighteen years had come and gone
For Momma they flew by
But for me they drug on and on
We were loadin' up that Chevy
Both tryin' not to cry
Momma kept on talkin', puttin' off goodbye
Then she took my hand and said
"Baby don't forget"
"Before you hit the highway
You better stop for gas
And there's a fifty in the ashtray
In case you run short on cash"
"Here's a map and here's a Bible
If you ever lose your way
Just one more thing before you leave
Don't forget to remember me"
This downtown apartment
Sure makes me miss home
And those bills there on the counter
Keep tellin' me I'm on my own
And just like every Sunday
I called Mama up last night
And even when it's not
I tell her everything's all right
Before we hung up I said
"Hey Mama don't forget"
"To tell my baby sister
I'll see her in the fall
And tell Mee-Mal that I miss her
Yeah I should give her a call"
"And make sure you tell daddy
That I'm still his little girl
Yeah I still feel like I'm where I'm supposed to be
But don't forget to remember me"
Tonight I find myself kneelin' by the bed to pray
I haven't done this in a while
So I don't know what to say
But Lord I feel so small sometimes
In this big old place
Yeah I know there's more important things
But don't forget to remember me
Don't forget to remember me
