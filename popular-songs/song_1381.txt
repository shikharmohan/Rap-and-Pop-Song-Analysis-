Big, orange ball, sinkin in the water
Toes in the sand, couldn't get much hotter
Little umbrella-shaded margaritas
Coconut oil tannin' senoritas
Oh now I know how Jimmy Buffet feels
Hands on the wheel, cruisin' down the interstate
Gas pedal sticks, carries my car away
I was goin' as fast as a rambler goes
I could feel the speed from my head to my toes
Oh now I know how Richard Petty feels
I've been around the block a time or two
Done almost everything a boy can do
I've done some livin', yeah, I've had fun
But there is one thing I haven't done
Saved 2 months, bought a little diamond
Tonight's the night, feels like perfect timin'
Down on one knee on momma's front steps
Man, I'm gonna die if she really says yes
I wanna know how forever feels
I've been around the block a time or two
Done almost everything a boy can do
I've done some livin', yeah, I've had fun
But there is one thing I haven't done
I wanna know how forever feels
Hey I wanna know how forever feels
Girl I wanna know how forever feels
