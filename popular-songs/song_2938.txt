The sun rose in the sky today,
Today, like every other day.
The breeze was cool - so cool on my face
Today, I felt the need to pray.
Pray for sanity - pray for peace,
Pray for the madness to end,
Pray for the solitude within myself
Pray for the pain to mend.
Insanity is such a funny thing -
It strikes the rich and it strikes the poor,
It strikes when you least expect it,
Sorta like an old-time folk lore.
---So---
Pray for sanity - pray for peace,
Pray for the madness to end.
Pray for the solitude within myself
Pray for the pain to mend.
Yes, pray for sanity & pray for peace,
Pray for the madness to end.
Pray for the solitude within myself
And pray for the pain to mend.
Just pray for the pain to mend.
The sun rose in the sky today.
Today, like every other day.
The breeze it stung, it hurt my face,
Yet still I felt the need to pray.
Felt the need to pray
