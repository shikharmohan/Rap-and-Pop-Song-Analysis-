[Chorus]
I'm so gone, so gone, so goooone
Don't know how i'ma get home, get home, get hoooome
Think I had too much patron, patron, patroooon
In the mornin I ain't gon get up
Job done called, said they fed up with me
Ahhhhhh, ahhhhh, ahhhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh
[Verse 1]
It's Jeremih, y'all know the name
Look at how the Chi done stole the game
I'm tipsy, dizzy, just checked my phone
My ex girl say she miss me
Well I'll be, now i'm signin' off
Gone off that patron and Tylenol
So icy, need I say it twicey
True religion jeans, still custom with the Nikes
Ahhhhhh, ahhhhh, ahhhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhh
[Chorus]
I'm so gone, so gone, so goooone
Don't know how i'ma get home, get home, get hoooome
Think I had too much patron, patron, patroooon
In the mornin I ain't gon get up
Job done called, said they fed up with me
[Verse 2]
Tequila in my system, you smell it thru my pulse
Can't nobody ever miss us, when we walk thru the doors
Shinin' like a chandelier, with this Georgia on my wrist and these crew cuts in my ear
I'm so fly, that's my intuition
High definition, flow, flow so ridiculous
Need not to mention, that I can't make it home and shawty say she feinin'
Was it the drank or purple smoke that got me leanin'
Ahhhhhh, ahhhhh, ahhhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhh
[Verse 3]
(This is the unfinished version so it's not recorded yet.)
Ahhhhhh, ahhhhh, ahhhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhh
[Chorus]
I'm so gone, so gone, so goooone
Don't know how i'ma get home, get home, get hoooome
Think I had too much patron, patron, patroooon
In the mornin I ain't gon get up
Job done called, said they fed up with me
