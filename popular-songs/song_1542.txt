IÃÂ¢€ve been around the ocean since I was a kid
I donÃÂ¢€t get to see it much these days
This morninÃÂ¢€ I walked down to it just to say I did
And Damned if it didnÃÂ¢€t take my breath away
I guess some things are just that way
Like a baby sleeping
A Momma kneeling
A Key-West sunset sky
Yeah the chills I get when you lay your lips on mine
ThatÃÂ¢€s Beautiful ... beautiful every time
Well I could hear the music drifting over the dunes
It sounded like a weddinÃÂ¢€ on the beach
I Figured IÃÂ¢€d take a closer look
Had nothinÃÂ¢€ better to do
Yes I forgot the sight a blushing bride could be
Well I guess amazing is always amazing
Like a baby sleeping
A Momma kneeling
A Key-West sunset sky
Yeah the chills I get when you lay your lips on mine
ThatÃÂ¢€s Beautiful
Beautiful every time
I guess amazing will always be amazing
Like a church choir singing
A nation healing
A soldier coming home alive
The love for me girl I see in your eyes
ThatÃÂ¢€s beautiful
Beautiful every time
Oh every time
