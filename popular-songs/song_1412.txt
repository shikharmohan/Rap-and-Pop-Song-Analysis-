There's a fork in the road on my way home
But temptation awaits, wine, a women and a song
Lord my will breaks, where that road bends
And tonight I took a turn for the worse again
Left was home and right was wrong
You can bet by now she knows which road I'm on
It's a road I know like the back of my hand
But tonight I took a turn for the worse again
My old truck pulls a little to the right
Seems to get a lot worse on Friday night
Things are bad at home, Lord I'm sick of work
So tonight I took a turn for the worse
Left was home and right was wrong
You can bet by now she knows which road I'm on
It's a road I know like the back of my hand
But tonight I took a turn for the worse again
Lord tonight I took a turn for the worse again
