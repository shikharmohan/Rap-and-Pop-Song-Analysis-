Que linda ma, que linda ma, tu que linda ma
Que linda ma, que linda ma, let's go
The room is spinnin' and I can't breathe
And ooh, my head is just achin'
Hands won't stop sweatin' and my knees, girl
They just wont stop shakin'
My stomach is turnin' flips
And I feel sick you see
And this is all just at
The thought of you leavin' me
(Baby, I'm a fool)
Am I stupid?
(Baby, I'm a fiend)
Addicted to it
(Baby, I don't know, yeah)
But your my get right when it's wrong
(Baby, it's your smile)
Makes me happy
(Baby, it's your touch)
So relaxing
(Whatever it is)
Without it I just can't go on
And I want you to know that
I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself
I don't need nothin' else
All I need is you
Why don't you just
Stay with me?
(Stay with me?)
Why don't you just
Stay with me?
(Stay with me?)
Why don't you just
Stay with me?
(Stay with me?)
Why don't you just
Stay with me?
Never gonna be without cha'
See myself with only you
Finally, found my inspiration
Hear your voice sing
(Baby woohoo)
Anything I gotcha'
Watcha' want indeed I'll be
'Cuz you are my everything
So baby, please just stay with me
(Baby, I'm a fool)
Am I stupid?
(Baby, I'm a fiend)
Addicted to it
(Baby, I don't know, yeah)
But your my get right when it's wrong
(Baby, it's your smile)
Makes me happy
(Baby, it's your touch)
So relaxing
(Whatever it is)
Without you I just can't go on, no
I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself
I don't need nothin' else
All I need is you
Why don't you just
Stay with me?
(Stay with me?)
Why don't you just
Stay with me?
(Stay with me?)
Why don't you just
Stay with me?
(Stay with me?)
Why don't you just
Stay with me?
Dah dah dah dah dah
Live from the 215
My baby girl, ride right on my left hand side
Mercedes, rug slide through the palm of a dime
The brother known best, it's the prince
And you my princess, let's get it on
Mami, que-linda
Look at cha' beautiful smile
I don't wanna leave ya
Why don't cha' stay for a while
I love to love ya
Like heavy bum-bum-tiddly-dee
Take off ya sneaks, let me tickle ya feet
Peddi a Libra
You think that Peddi a freak
Oh, you a Leo
I heard they rather unique
You're such a diva
You're such a pleasure to meet
You're one of your stature
1 in a million, nothin' else matters
'Cuz I love to turn you on
You're like my favorite song
Without you would be wrong
(Would be wrong)
Forever and always
Did you know what you do for me?
Love you, you're my melody
Wearin' my heart on my sleeve
(Music)
You're all I need
I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself
I don't need nothin' else
All I need is you
Why don't you just
Stay with me?
(Stay with me?)
Why don't you just
Stay with me?
(Stay with me?)
Why don't you just
Stay with me?
Why don't you just
Stay with me?
