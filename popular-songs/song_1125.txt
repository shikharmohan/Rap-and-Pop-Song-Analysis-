The cards are stacking up against us
These days our luck is running low
It's hard to explain but a little bit of rain
Seems to follow us wherever we go
Black cat sittin' on a ladder
Broken mirror on the wall
We're not a bit superstitious
No need to worry at all
'Cause when we can't roll a seven
And our last lucky penny is gone this world can be tough
But I know when our love is this strong
We can make a little luck of our own, luck of our own
The storm is only temporary
But you and I are here to stay
Baby can't you see true love is all we need
So just throw that rabbit's foot away
'Cause when we can't roll a seven
And our last lucky penny is gone this world can be tough
But I know when our love is this strong
We can make a little luck of our own, oh we can make it baby
'Cause when we can't roll a seven
And our last lucky penny is gone this world can be tough
But I know our love is this strong
We can make a little luck of our own
We can make a little luck of our own
Yeah, yeah, ooh we can make it baby
Make a little luck of our own
