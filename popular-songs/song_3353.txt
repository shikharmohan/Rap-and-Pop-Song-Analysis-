Father Johnson went to the crossroads
So the Legend goes
He lived with his guitar and the Devil took his soul
The Devil took his soul
Been out here on this highway
Breathin' diesel smoke
Drivin' hard for hours
Tryin' to make that Memphis show
People always ask me
"Son what does it take
To reach out and touch your dreams?"
To them I always say
Are you hungry? Are you thirsty?
Is it a fire that burns you up inside?
How bad do you want it?
How bad do you need it?
Are you eatin', sleepin', dreamin'
With that one thing on your mind?
How bad do you want it?
How bad do you need it?
'Cause if you want it all
You've got to lay it all out on the line
I get to make my livin'
Doin' what I love
Every night I give my heart and soul
Sometimes that ain't enough
But brother, if you're like me
Lookin' down that road
Be careful of that wild wind, son
Sometimes it don't let go
Can you feel it? Can you taste it?
Can you hear it? Ohh, knockin' at your door?
How bad do you want it?
How bad do you need it?
Are you eatin', sleepin', dreamin'
With that one thing on your mind?
How bad do you want it?
How bad do you need it?
'Cause if you want it all
You've got to lay it all out on the line
That's right
There's always a price you pay
No matter what you do
If you're gonna climb that mountain to the top
It always comes down too
How bad do you want it?
How bad do you need it?
Are you eatin', sleepin', dreamin'
With that one thing on your mind?
How bad do you want it?
How bad do you need it?
'Cause if you want it all
You've got to lay it all out on the line
Preach on brother
Father Johnson went to the crossroads
So the Legend goes
He lived with his guitar and the Devil took his soul
The Devil took his soul
