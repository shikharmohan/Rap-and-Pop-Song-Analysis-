She'll call me honey
When she needs a helping hand
She might say darlin'
If she needs someone to understand
She'll call me sugar
If she's feelin' kinda sweet
She'll say that I'm crazy
Over my little jealousies
When she calls me baby
I just reach for the light
And I'll hold her like a lady
Thank God she's all mine
With her arms around me
I can leave the world behind
When she calls me baby
Well, I know what's on her mind
When this life
Has brought me to my knees
She's got a way of bringin' out
The man in me
When she calls me baby
I just reach for the light
I'll hold her like a lady
Thank God she's all mine
With her arms around me
I can leave the world behind
When she calls me baby
I know what's on her mind
Oh, when she calls me baby
Well, I know what's on her mind
