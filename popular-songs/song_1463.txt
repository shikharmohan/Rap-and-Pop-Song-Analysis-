I'm dreaming tonight of a place I love
Even more than I usually do
And although I know, it's a long road back
I promise you
I'll be home for Christmas, you can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe and presents under the tree
Christmas Eve will find me, where the love-light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas if only in my dreams
Oh, oh ah, I'll be home for Christmas, you can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe and presents under the tree
Oh, Christmas Eve will find me, where the love-light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas if only in my dreams
If only yeah, well now, if only, only, only, only
If only in my dreams, if only, well, well, well Lord
If only oh, if only in my dreams
