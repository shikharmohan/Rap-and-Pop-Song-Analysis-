I stood before God, my family and friends
And vowed that I'd never love anyone else again
Only him
As pure as my gown of white, I stood by his side
And promised that I'd love him till the day I died
Lord, please forgive me even though I lied
'Cause You're the only one who knows just how hard I tried
I had a ring on my finger and time on my hands
The woman in me needed the warmth of a man
The gold turned cold in my wedding band
It's just a ring on your finger when there's time on your hands
When I add up all the countless nights, I cried myself to sleep
And all the broken promises you somehow failed to keep
He can't blame me
'Cause he's the one who left me too many times alone
In a three bedroom prison I tried to make a home
My love slowly died but the fire inside still burned
And the arms of a stranger was the only place left to turn
I had a ring on my finger and time on my hands
The woman in me needed the warmth of a man
The gold turned cold in my wedding band
It's just a ring on your finger when there's time on your hands
I had a ring on my finger and time on my hands
'Cause the woman in me needed the warmth of a man
The gold turned cold in my wedding band
It's just a ring on your finger when there's time on your hands
