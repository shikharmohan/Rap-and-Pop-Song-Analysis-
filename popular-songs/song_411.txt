I was always taught
Its gunna be a struggle at whatever you tryin' to accomplish
So when times get hard
Don't give up
Coz that just might be where the Magic happens..

Verse 1:
When when when you born with a gift to make em say dang'
Gotta be having a boy its insane
So so amazing
Oh david blane
Gotta look at Criss Angel (a famous magician)
Taste the hood fame
Cant complain
When i grip woodcane
From the pimp to the ghetto to that im Batman
Rabbit in the hat the trick is to lame
Want more currency who wanting my chain?
Hocus Pocus im soo focus
Give me the lambo the maybach and the lotus
400 grand work the ice i notice
Hoping the fans know im whole full of hopeless
Set a goal in the hat to achieve it
Start stuntin' the wonderful achievement
Who be in the game for no reason
OHH
