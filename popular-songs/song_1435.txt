There's a lot of ways of saying 
What I want to say to you
There's songs and poems and promises 
And dreams that might come true
But I won't talk of starry skies 
Or moonlight on the ground
I'll come right out and tell you 
I'd just love to lay you down
Lay you down and softly whisper 
Pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things 
My woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means 
Having you around
Oh, darlin' how I'd love to lay you down
There's so many ways your sweet love 
Made this house into a home
You've got a way of doing 
Little things that turn me on
Like standing in the kitchen 
In your faded cotton gown
With your hair all up in curlers 
I still love to lay you down
Lay you down and softly whisper 
Pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things 
My woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means 
Having you around
Oh, darlin' how I'd love to lay you down
Now, When a whole lot of Decembers 
Are showin' in your face
Your auburn hair has faded 
And silver takes it's place
You'll be just as lovely and I'll still be around
And if I can I know that 
I'd still love to lay you down
Lay you down and softly whisper 
Pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things 
My woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means 
Having you around
Oh, darlin' how I'd love to lay you down
Oh, darlin' how I'd love
Oh, darlin' how I'd love to lay you down...
