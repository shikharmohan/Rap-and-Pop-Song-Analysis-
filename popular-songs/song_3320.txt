INTRO: (spoken)
Areola, that shirt came off, that bra came off and...so crazy
What a day. What a motha fuckin' day. I tell ya.
Baby, i'm home! Hey, baby!
What's that smell? Smell like..like my baby's pussy.
What the fuck?! (Oh, shit! Sorry! Shit!)
(CHORUS)
What do you do when you're workin, come home, and i'm creepin' out the back door
Pants on the floor and you're lookin' at her sayin' "Whatcha doin' that for?"
(VERSE ONE)
This is how it goes when you're hard at work (hard at work)
I'm with ya lady and i'm all up in her skirt (all up in her skirt)
She chose a rapper 'cause this rapper know how to tap her
Strap her down and attack her while you sneak in, watch pornos and jerk (watch pornos and jerk)
And ya can't be mad at me 'cause your thick bitch wanna ravage me
Got my big dick in her cavities then it's spit spit i'm in anatomy
And ya can't come badgin' me 'cause she sick wanna insert half of me
Straight addicted to the master he whips the sticks up without batteries
Poetry in motion
I make her water 'cause i'm a scholar i father her twat and bother her i got her
She'll eat anything I want her to eat, she'll swallow anything I want her to swaller
she'll go down & chew on my dog, doin' anything that'll make me holler.
And you the victim don't even know whats ya comin' home to, I'm bangin it out &she;'s screamin like we doin kungfu. Im feelin' right cuz you the one she do the wrong to. Now that you know your lady is creepin'-- whatcha goin' do??

(VERSE 3)
What would you do if your boo crept on youÃ¢"with me, new tattoo with the letter "P"Ã¢"all over her humps like the letter "B". Trip if you want to, scared nigger  never meÃ¢Â¦ your girl has been land-marked, that means that I marked her- that means that I skidded sperm all over her twat furÃ¢Â¦ that means that I got her, where you never had her- sex game critical, now she is a master.  You never got ur dick licked, mine is getting tongue-kissed, she could suck a orange thru a straw call her SunkistÃ¢Â¦ Man, she a cold chick, yeah I know you miss thatÃ¢Â¦ bank account access- ya- you know I did that. Put it where her ribs at, then i let her slip on it if ya like it then ya shoulda put a ring on it. Cuz Paul Mussan had that pussy with a sling on it. And I aint even poppin' E homie, but the question isÃ¢Â¦
