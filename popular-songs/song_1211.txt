Do you remember me? I sat upon your knee
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies
Well, I'm all grown up now and still need help somehow
I'm not a child but my heart still can dream
So here's my lifelong wish
My grown up Christmas list
Not for myself
But for a world in need
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end, no
This is my grown up Christmas list
As children we believe
The grandest sight to see
Was something lovely
Wrapped beneath a tree
But heaven only knows
That packages and bows
Can never heal a heart ached human soul
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end, no
This is my grown up Christmas list
What is this illusion
Called the innocence of youth
Maybe only in our blind belief
Can we ever find the truth
No more lives torn apart
  (No more torn apart)
That wars would never start
  (Never start)
And time would heal all hearts
  (Oh, hearts)
Everyone would have a friend
  (One would have a friend)
And right would always win
  (Would always win)
And love would never end
  (Never, never end, no)
This is my grown up Christmas list
This is my only lifelong wish
This is my grown up Christmas list
