Yeah, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, yeah
Sometimes I walk a little faster
In the school hallway just to get next to you
Some days I spend a little extra time
In the morning just to impress you
Guess you don't notice, guess you don't need this
Sad, you're not seeing what you're missing
On the outside shying away
On the inside dying to say
I'm unusual, not so typical
Way too smart to be waiting around
Tai Chi practices, snowboard champion
I can fix the flat on your car
I might even be a rock star
I might even be a rock star
Sometimes I wish when the phone rings
That it would be you saying, "Let's hang out"
Then you confess that there's something special
In between us, why don't we find out
You don't know me, guess you don't need me
Why you're not seein' what you're missin'
On the outside shyin' away
On the inside dying to say
I'm unusual, not so typical
Way too smart to be waiting around
Tai Chi practices, snowboard champion
I can fix the flat on your car
I might even be a rock star
If you only knew the real me
I might even be a rock star
I'm telling you that we are meant to be
Now wouldn't it be nice if you could see
That I really am a rock star
Yeah yeah, woo
Yeah I really am a rock star
Ha, a rock star
I'm unusual, not so typical
Way too smart to be waiting around
Tai Chi practices, snowboard champion
I can fix the flat on your car
Rockin' it wherever we are, yeah yeah
'Cause I really am a rock star
'Cause I really am a rock star
I am a rock star, whoa, yeah!
Goodnight everybody!
