See once they open my liiiid imma give it to em
Ever since i was a lil bitty kiiiid Ive been truly ruined
I reflected on what I diiid before i ran into em
I used to be a fat jerk now I flirt causE the scent of a woman
Now I dont act like walk like the nigga that you used to know
Now I sing and rap about the strange life its beautiful
Tell it to em Like a gen-ius
Spit it out like I thought you knew
Bubblin hope you hear me Thizz
