Up in the morning
Out on the job
Work like the devil for my pay
Lucky old sun ain't got nothing to do
But roll around heaven all day
Fuss with my woman, toil for my kids
And sweat till I'm wrinkled and gray
But that lucky old sun ain't got nothing to do
But roll around heaven all day
Dear Lord above can't you see I'm trying
Tears are in my eyes
Send down a cloud with a silver lining
Take me to paradise
Show me that river
Lead me across
And take all my troubles away
Like the lucky old sun I'll have nothing to do
Roll around Heaven all day
Lord above, can't you see I'm crying
Tears are in my eyes
Send down a cloud with silver lining
Take me to paradise
Show me a river, show me that river
Lead me across, and take all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun I'll have nothing to do
But roll around Heaven all day
Roll around Heaven all day.
