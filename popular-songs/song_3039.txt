Do you still drink whiskey?
Can I buy you a round?
If nobody's sitting here
Do you mind if I sit down?
I was nervous when I saw you
I almost walked away
And now I can't believe
What I'm about to say
These arms wanna hold you
These lips wanna kiss you
These eyes are glad to see you
And baby, I miss you
Let's drive each other crazy
Like we did back then
Why don't we get together
And break each others hearts again?
Maybe I've had one too many
I don't wanna say too much
We both know the reasons
Why we didn't keep in touch
We're no good for each other
Still it's hard to let it go
And I'm trying to be strong
But babe, you've got to know
These arms wanna hold you
These lips wanna kiss you
These eyes are glad to see you
Baby, I miss you
Let's drive each other crazy
Like we did back then
Why don't we get together
And break each others hearts again?
And loving you should be
The last thing on my mind
It feels so good to let you
Hurt me one more time
These arms wanna hold you
These lips wanna kiss you
These eyes are glad to see you
Baby, I miss you
Let's drive each other crazy
Like we did back then
Why don't we get together
And break each others hearts again?
Why don't we get together
And break each others hearts again?
