I've seen you smile more than I thought you would
And I smiled back a little more than I should
And lately at night while he's sound asleep
I'm thinkin' things that I shouldn't think
You're the first time I've thought about leavin'
And I really don't know what I'll do
You're the first time I've thought about leavin' him
I've never known someone like you
Sometimes I'll wait when I really should go
Lord only knows what I do that for
And when I get home and he holds me close
I try not to think what I'm thinkin' most
You're the first time I've thought about leavin'
And I really don't know what I'll do
You're the first time I've thought about leavin' him
I've never known someone like you
I've never known someone like you
