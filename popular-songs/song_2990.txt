I set my mind to it
Said "I wasn't gonna do it"
No how, no sir, no way
I wouldn't give my heart up
Gonna keep my guard up
And save it for another day
Then you walked in
With that crazy grin
And everything I swore before
Got lost in your eyes
And flew right out the door
Suddenly I heard the love songs
Playing real soft on the jukebox
Somebody ordered up a moonlight
And painted stars all across the sky
Is it gravity or destiny?
Either way there's nothing I can do
Looks like I picked the wrong night
Not to fall in love with you
I briefly resisted
But my heart insisted
It was gonna be giving in
Hard as I was trying
There was no denying
Which one of us would win
You came up beside me
And asked if I'd be
Open to have a dance
Right then I knew
This thing was out of my hands
Suddenly I heard the love songs
Playing real soft on the jukebox
Somebody ordered up a moonlight
And painted stars all across the sky
Is it gravity or destiny?
Either way there's nothing I can do
Looks like I picked the wrong night
Not to fall in love with you
Suddenly I heard love songs
Playing real soft on the jukebox
Somebody ordered up a moonlight
And painted stars all across the sky
Is it gravity or destiny?
Either way there's nothing I can do
Looks like I picked the wrong night
Not to fall in love with you
Oh looks like a wrong night
Not to fall in love with you
