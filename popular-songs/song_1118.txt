And I can hear the neighbors they're arguin' again
And there hasn't been peace on our street since who knows when
And I don't mean to listen in but the shoutin' is so loud
I turn up the radio to drown it out
And silently I say a little prayer
But for the grace of God go I
I must've been born a lucky guy
Heaven only knows how I've been blessed
With the gift of your love
And I look around and all I see
Is your happiness embracing me
Oh Lord I'd be lost
But for the grace of God
I can see that old man, he's walking past our door
And I've been told that he's rich but he seems so poor
'Cause no one comes to call on him and his phone it never rings
He wanders through his empty home surrounded by his things
And silently I say a little prayer, yes I do
But for the grace of God go I
I must've been born a lucky guy
Heaven only knows how I've been blessed
With the gift of your love
And I look around and all I see
Is your happiness embracing me
Oh Lord I'd be lost
But for the grace of God
I look around and all I see
Is your happiness embracing me
Oh Lord I'd be lost
But for the grace of God
Oh Lord I'd be lost
But for the grace of God, yeah
I'd be lost
But for the grace of God, yeah
