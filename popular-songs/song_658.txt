How can you just say that you love me
Yet to leave you alone
You said these walls were here to protect us
But it's still not a home
All these questions that are burning inside
With answers I'll never know
'Cause you're the only one who knows, how you feel
But you're not letting me know
What is it, love, can I help you?
I see where this has gone
And what it's coming to
I've looked to you, enough
I can't believe this is me
Where I can touch and not feel you
I feel I'm lost in a dream
Between what is and what seems
Having to face not to need you
You know you owe it to me
How can you think we don't need you?
I'm tired of running away from my fear
And the day that our life has no meaning
Without a word or a reason
Like a coward you're leaving
Sitting here inside an empty room
That was filled with us
Only boxes to define what was left
Of what we used to call love
It's sad that after all of this time
You have nothing to say
Ooh, an' of all the things that you could've done
You choose to walk away
I'm thankful, love, I don't hate you
'Cause I'd rather live
And know than what you put me through
I needed you somehow
I can't believe this is me
Where I can touch and not feel you
I feel I'm lost in a dream
Between what is and what seems
Having to face not to need you
How could you do this to me?
How could you think we don't need you?
I'm tired of running away from my fear
And the day that our life has no meaning
Without a word or a reason
Like a coward you're leaving
I can't believe this is me
I wasn't wrong to believe you
I feel I'm lost in a dream
Between what is and what seems
Having to face not to need you
How could you do this to me?
How could you think we don't need you?
I'm tired of running away from my fear
And the day that our life has no meaning
Without a word or a reason
Like a coward you're leaving
