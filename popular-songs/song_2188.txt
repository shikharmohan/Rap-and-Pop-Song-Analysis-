If I may, if I might, lay me down weeping
If I say, what is like I might be dreaming
If I may, what is right so many time, see me heal
Those years in his vomit
A phrase from his pocket
And chains holding the wind, I won't be
Dream
Do re mi, do re mi
Do re mi
If I may, If I'm right wake me up, see me
If I do, If I like find me how to see me
If I may cold as ice, I may, how to see me
Raised in his socket
It fades from his moment
A chase from his socket I will need
Ray dream
Do re mi, do re mi
Do re mi, do re mi
Do re mi
Wish me good, wish me light, break me down, see me
In your way just be quiet, follow pain and bleed me
Yell or wail and if I sigh sink me how, TV
If I may, if I might gonna go to bleed
Praise in his pocket
Praise from his moment
A chase from his own in my tea
Ray dream
Rape me, don't rape me
Do re mi, do re mi
Don't rape me, do re mi
