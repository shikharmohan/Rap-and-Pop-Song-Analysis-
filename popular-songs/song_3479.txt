Every time our eyes meet, there is a feelin' inside me
It's almost more than I can take
Baby, when you touch me, I can feel how much you love me
And it just blows me away
I've never been this close to anyone or anything
I can hear your thoughts, I can see your dreams
I dunno how you do, what you do, I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better, I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side, for ever and ever
Every little thing that you do, baby, I'm amazed by you
The smell of your skin, the taste of your kiss
The way you whisper in the dark, you're hair all around me
Baby, you surround me, you touch every place in my heart
Oh, it feels like the first time, every time
I wanna spend the whole night in your eyes
I dunno how you do, what you do, I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better, I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side, for ever and ever
Every little thing that you do, baby, I'm amazed by you
Every little thing that you do, I'm so in love with you
And it just keeps getting better, I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side, for ever and ever
Every little thing that you do, every little thing that you do
Baby, I'm amazed by you
