It's an odd alliance
It's another lie, I'd say
Fall in love tonight
Even if my eyes
Even have some time
I'm burning out tonight
It's another thing that I'll write
Feeling like I'll die by myself, why?
It's mad enough tonight
And for it's never cold
It's not a right
When I can, never mind
It's all mine, it's all mine
Inside I hide
I've been here for my friends
I never know how if I said
Watching out for me
Where I can love you
Have your way
And she might as well know I
Seem more my high
Then I said
"Minerals will make the world
If we did not have chemicals
You would not be writing my
Death certificate"
Fighting is my friend
My dog left me, yes, I'm sad
One more day, then I can climb inside, safe from you
Fighting isn't my friend
When I will never have my friend
Fighting silence as a friend
His silence and setting up around
And she improvised
As she was supervised
And I was all arised
Or arose, or arose, or a rose
Or aroused and fucked
Finally and I
Was in my trap
And I another guy
And a knife
My milk is your shit
My milk is your shit
It's hard and boiled
And, and sour, all again
My milk is your shit
My milk is your shit
My milk is your shit
My milk is your shit
My milk is your shit
My milk is your shit
My milk is your shit
My milk is your shit
It revolves, it revolves
It revolves and around
And over all
Liver and bones
Liver and bones
Liver and bones
Liver and bones
With the Ramones
Come out and smile
And I'll watch when
My milk is your shit
My milk is your shit
My milk is your shit
My milk is your shit
My milk is your
My milk is your
My milk is your shit
My milk is it
Psst, got to get all of it
'Cause I can't fight
