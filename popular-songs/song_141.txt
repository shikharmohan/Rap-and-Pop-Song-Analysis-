18 years have come and gone, for momma they flew by but for me they drug on and on. we were loading up that chevy both trying not to cry, momma kept on talking putting off goodbye then she took my hand and said before you hit the highway you better stop for gas and there's a fifty in the ash tray in case you run short on cash, here's a map and here's a bible if you ever lose your way, just one more thing before you leave, don't forget to remember me.  
This downtown apartment sure makes me miss home, and those bills there on the counter keep telling me I'm on my own, and just like every Sunday I called momma up last night, and even when it's not I tell her everything's alright. Before we hung up I say, hey momma don't forget to tell my baby sister I'll see her in the fall and tell memaw that I miss her yeah I should give her a call, and make sure you tell daddy that I'm still his little girl yeah I still feel like I'm where I 'm supposed to be, but don't forget to remember me.
Tonight I find myself kneeling by the bed to pray, I haven't done this in a while so I don't know what to say but lord I feel so small sometimes in this big old place, yeah I know there's more important things but don't forget to remember me. Don't forget to remember me.
