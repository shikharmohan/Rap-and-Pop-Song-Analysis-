Don't you know
That you're the one
I'd like to live my life through
I can't see anyone with me but you
I want to go where you go
And share the things you do
For I've waited all my life for you
I've heard tales that true love comes
Only once in a lifetime
And this time is the last time for me
For I just can't imagine
Being in love with someone new
'Cuz I've waited all my life for you
So here it is, all the love
That I've saved for a lifetime
Never touched, never crushed
And never used
And to think that I'd ever find you
It's impossible but true
'Cuz I've waited all my life for you
Oh I just can't imagine
Being in love with someone new
'Cuz I've waited all my life for you
