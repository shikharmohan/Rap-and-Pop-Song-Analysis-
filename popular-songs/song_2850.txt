If I had only known, it was the last walk in the rain
I'd keep you out for hours in the storm
I would hold your hand, like a life line to my heart
Underneath the thunder we'd be warm
If I had only known, it was our last walk in the rain
If I had only known, I'd never hear your voice again
I'd memorize each thing you ever said
And on those lonely nights, I could think of them once more
And keep your words alive inside my head
If I had only known, I'd never hear your voice again
You were the treasure in my hand
You were the one who always stood beside me
So unaware, I foolishly believed that you would always be there
But then there came a day and I turned my head and you slipped away
If I had only known, it was my last night by your side
I'd pray a miracle would stop the dawn
And when you'd smile at me, I would look into your eyes
And make sure you know my love, for you goes on and on
If I had only known, if I had only known
Oh the love I would've shown, if I had only known
