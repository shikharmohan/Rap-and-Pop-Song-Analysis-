By now I should've been broken
On the rocks that rise from life's ocean
Just another ship lost at sea
By now I should've been scattered
In the wind of my lonesome travels
Like a thousand dandelion seeds
And I should've come unraveled
At the seams like a well worn sweater
But you hold me together
My hopes should've been shattered
Like a bottle out behind some tavern
From a fight that you had no chance to win
My dreams should've been ashes
Gone up in smoke like a book of matches
Tossed away and never gonna burn again
And I should've worn right through
Like an old cowboy's boot leather
But you hold me together
I feel your love surrounding me
Strong enough that I can believe
There won't ever be a storm that I can't weather
'Cause you hold me together, ah ooh, together, yeah yeah
I feel your love surrounding me
Strong enough that I can believe
There won't ever be a storm that I can't weather
No, there'll never be a storm that I can't weather
I should've been long forgotten
Just a footnote down at the bottom
Of a page in the book of what could've beens
My heart should lie in pieces
On the ground like a goodbye letter
But you hold me together
Oh, you hold me together, yeah yeah
You hold me together, ah ooh, together, yeah yeah
Oh, you hold me, you hold me together, oh oh
