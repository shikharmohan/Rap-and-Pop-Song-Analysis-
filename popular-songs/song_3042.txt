(Reba McEntire, Hank Williams Jr., Tom Petty, Willie Nelson)
HANK:
If the wife and I are fussin', brother, that's alright
'Cause me and that woman bought a license to fight
Why don't you mind your own business
Mind your own business
'Cause if you mind your business
Then you won't be mindin' mine
REBA:
Oh, the man at the apartment is a nosy thing
He comes to my door and it's a ring, ring, ring
Go mind your own business
Hey, won't you mind your own business
'Cause if you mind your own business
Then you won't be mindin' mine
TOM:
Yeah, I got a little girl, wears her hair up high
The boys all quiver when she walks by
You better mind your own business
Yes, mind your own business
If you mind your own business
Then you won't be mindin' mine
Rev. Ike:
Mindin' other people's business seems to be high-toned
I got all that I can do of mindin' my own
Why don't you mind your own business
Mind your own business
'Cause if you mind your business, you won't be mindin'
mine
WILLIE:
I may tell a lotta stories that may not be true
But I can get to Heaven just as easy as you
So won't you mind your own business
Why don't you mind your own business
'Cause if you mind your business
Then you won't be mindin' mine
HANK:
Hey, if I wanna honky-tonk around to two or three
Baby, that's my headache - don't you worry about me
Just mind your own business
Mind your own business
Well, if you mind your business
You'll be busy all the time
