Look out for Cruella De Vil
Cruella De Vil, Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you, no evil thing will
To see her is to take a sudden chill
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
The curl of her lips, the ice in her stare
All innocent children had better beware
She's like a spider waiting for the kill
Look out for Cruella De Vil
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you, no evil thing will
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
To see her is to take a sudden chill
Cruella De Vil
This vampire bat, this inhuman beast
She ought to be locked up and never released
The world was such a wholesome place
Until Cruella, Cruella De Vil, yeah
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you, no evil thing will
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
To see her is to take a sudden chill
Cruella De Vil
At first you think Cruella is a devil
But after time has worn away the shock
You come to realize, you've seen her kind of eyes
Watching you from underneath a rock
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you, no evil thing will
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
To see her is to take a sudden chill
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you, no evil thing will
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
To see her is to take a sudden chill
Cruella De Vil
Cruella De Vil, yeah
Cruella De Vil
Look out for Cruella De Vil
