It's so relieving
To know that you're leaving
As soon as you get paid
It's so relaxing
To hear that you're asking
Whenever you get your way
It's so soothing
To know that you'll sue me
This is starting to sound the same
Well I miss the comfort in being sad
Well I miss the comfort in being sad
Well I miss the comfort in being sad
In her false witness
We hope you're still with us
To see if they float or drown
Our favorite patient
A display of patience
Disease-covered Puget Sound
She'll come back as fire
To burn all the liars
Leave a blanket of ash on the ground
Well I miss the comfort in being sad
Well I miss the comfort in being sad
Well I miss the comfort in being sad
It's so relieving
To know that you're leaving
As soon as you get paid
It's so relaxing
To know that you're asking
Wherever you get your way
It's so soothing
To know that you'll sue me
This is starting to sound the same
Well I miss the comfort in being sad
Well I miss the comfort in being sad
Well I miss the comfort in being sad
