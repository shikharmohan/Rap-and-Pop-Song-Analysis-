[Verse 1]
Never doubt never doubt
Here for you here for me
Worry not I'll be there
Strenght when you feel weak
In the dark when you can't see
Guiding light I will be
All I need all I need
Is for you to do the same for me
[Chorus]
Even heroes need heroes sometimes
And even the strong need someone to tell them it's allright
Even heroes need heroes sometimes
Will you be my hero tonight
[Verse 2]
Just look up up so high
Just above you is where I fly
But if I fall from the sky
On you can I rely
I'll protect you from the world
Whenever I can
But will you do the same for me
Now and again
[Chorus]
Even heroes need heroes sometimes
And even the strong need someone to tell them its allright
Even heroes need heroes sometimes
Will you be my hero tonight
[Verse 3]
Come to my my rescue
Do for me as I do for you
Be my guide when I am blind
'Cause no one can be strong all the time
[Hook]
Even heroes need heroes sometimes
Will you be my hero tonight [will you be my hero]
[Chorus]
Even heroes need heroes sometimes [will you be my hero]
And even the strong need someone to tell them its allright [will you be my hero]
Even heroes need heroes sometimes
Will you be my hero tonight [will you be my hero][3x]
Will you be my hero tonight
