(Racers start your engines)
The checkered flag
Is a waving
My heart is racing
Racing for you
Its too sad
That you're leaving
I thought maybe we could
Be something
Now I'm chasing you down
In a fast car
[Chorus:]
The speed
The sound
The wind
The crowd
You can't stop my heart
Oh oh yeah
Racing through my heart
Oh oh yeah
You are
ah ah
Racing through my heart
In a fast car
Don't go too fast
You'll break my heart
Then I don't know what to do
'Cause I'm still in love
With you
[Chorus]
Oh yeah
Racing
Hey la
Hey la
Through my heart
Oh yeah
[Chorus]
(fast car)
