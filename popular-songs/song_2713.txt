I overheard a conversation your name was mentioned in
But they didn't talk about us, only her again
I didn't want to listen but I hung on every word
They said some things I wish I hadn't heard
Rumor has it, she has you, rumor has it, you love her too
Talk is cheap but the price is high when it's true
Rumor has it she has you
This town's so small, a whisper can be heard a mile away
And people here will gossip when there's nothing else to say
I wouldn't have believed my ears but I see it in your eyes
Those stories going 'round this town aren't lies
Rumor has it, she has you, rumor has it, you love her too
Oh yeah, talk is cheap but the price is high when it's true
Rumor has it, she has you, rumor has it, she has you
