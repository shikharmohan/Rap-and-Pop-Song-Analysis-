Dear Santa I'm a grown man now,
But I've got a problem here. 
If you've been watching then you must know,
I've not been good all year. 
I Let her down lost sight of us,
I don't deserve one thing but she does
Dear Santa bring her a heart, 
The one she's got is broken. 
Fill up her stocking with the words,
That I left unspoken.
Now I'm not asking you to bring her love,
'Cause Christmas morning when she wakes up, 
Dear Santa that's what she'll get from me.
Now I remember Christmas past, 
When little was enough.
Now all the presents under all the trees 
Couldn't save our love. 
We need a miricale like the one on 34th,
To get us back to where we were before.
Dear Santa bring her a heart, 
The one she's got is broken. 
Fill up her stocking with the words,
That I left unspoken.
Now I'm not asking you to bring her love,
'Cause Christmas morning when she wakes up, 
Dear Santa that's what she'll get from me.
Dear Santa bring her a heart, 
The one she's got is broken. 
Fill up her stocking with the words,
That I left unspoken.
Now I'm not asking you to bring her love,
'Cause Christmas morning when she wakes up, 
Dear Santa that's what she'll get from me.

Oh Yeah That's Right
