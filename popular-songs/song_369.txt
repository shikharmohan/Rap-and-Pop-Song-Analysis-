Just because it didn't last
Doesn't mean that we were wrong
We both fell in love so fast
And now it's gone and the hurt is strong
Though we don't see eye to eye
And a wind's begun to blow
I'm gonna love you till I die
And I want you to know till they lay me low
I'll pray that love will bless and find you
Pray for joy and happiness
Pray for two strong arms around you
Pray
Was it something we can't see?
Maybe something we don't know
If it wasn't meant to be
We should just say so and let it go
I'll pray that love will bless and find you
Pray for joy and happiness
Pray for two strong arms around you
Pray that with time you'll someday find peace
I'll pray that love will bless and find you
Pray for joy and happiness
Pray for two strong arms around you
Pray that with time you'll someday find peace, oh
That with time you'll someday find love
