Driving down the road of guilt, the highway that never ends, taking naps in my old car, singin in guitar bars, killin time at cafe queens, and truckers playing slot machines, I meet a lot of wannabes dreaming big and living free like me
Charlie runs a produce shack, living in a van out back
selling peas and homemade surfs
cantelopes and elvis shirts bragging on future plans with whisky breath and shaky hands, I meet a lot of wannabes dreaming big and living free like me
wearing wrinkled travel clothes
to another one night show cause thats where I was born to be,
have guitar will travel light 
Here today and gone tonight 
playing this lifetime lottery
heres to faces i have seen 
a carnival of those who dream 
rodeos seeking thing 
table dancers I can't name 
billy t and abeline 
Karaoke's all time king 
and a ever six string wannabe 
dreamin big and livin free like me
wearing wrinkled travel clothes to another one night show, 
cause thats where i was born to be, 
have guitar will travel light, 
here today and gone tonight 
playin this lifetime lottery
to every dreamer i have know may the luck take you home 
i pray for every wannabe 
dreaming big and living free like me
i pray for every wannabe dreaming big and living free
like me
living free like me
living free like me
living free like me
