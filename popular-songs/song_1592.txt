Let it begin!
Nobody listens to me
Don't hear a single thing I've said
Say anything to soothe me
Anything to get you from my head
Don't know how really it feels
To fake the days to make like I don't care
Don't know how much it hurts
To turn around like you were never there
Like somehow you could be the break
And I could walk away from the promises we made
And swore we'd never break!
I thought I'd lost you when you ran away to try to find me
I thought I'd never your sweet face again
I turned around and you were gone and on and on the days went
But I kept the moment that we were in
And I knew in my heart you'd come back to me my friend
And now I got you! I thought I lost you!
I told myself I wouldn't sleep
'Til I searched the world from sea to sea
I made a wish upon a star
I turned around and there you were
Now here we are, are!
Here we are
I thought I lost you!
I thought I lost you!
You!
I thought I lost you
I thought I lost you too
