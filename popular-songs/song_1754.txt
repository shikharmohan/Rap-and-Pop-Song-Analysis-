Looks like we found ourselves
Up against a wall
In need of a little help
But no one wants to call
After all we've been through
Do we let our friendship end?
You need me and I need you
No, we will not break, never break
But even if we bend, yeah it's
You and me together
Yeah I'm always on your side
No one, no one, no one can ever change it
C'mon let 'em try
'Cause it's you and me together now
Anyone can have a day
When their heart is on their sleeve
No one wants to see it our way
Can't agree to disagree
You'd think it'd be easier
But it feels like you just can't win
But somehow we'll make it work
'Cause we deserve it, you know we're worth it
You can't give up on friends, 'cause it's
You and me together
Yeah I'm always on your side
No one, no one, no one can ever change it
C'mon let 'em try
'Cause it's you and me together now
Together now
Oh now, now, now
It's you and me together, together, together
Yeah I'm always on your side
No one, no one, no one can ever change it
C'mon let 'em try, c'mon let 'em try!
It's you and me together
Yeah I'm always on your side
No one, no one, no one can ever change it
C'mon let 'em try
'Cause it's you and me together now
Together now, together now
