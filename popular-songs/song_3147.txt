Ain't no way you 'bout
To stop this sickness from the deepest darkest
Part of misery psycho alpha schizo
Get your chick she digging me
A.B.S.O.L.U.T.E. power
See me clownin', look at all you player haters
Frownin', raw, God said kill'em all Tech's backs to the wall
Fighting four my life and I'mma bust back till they fall
And I ain't even slangin' them thangs I'm hollin' 187
If you trippin' with strange
I'm really real with it
Like my homey A.J say deal with it
Pushin' and pullin', fightin' for the mill ticket
In a minute I'mma do it like a villain
I'mma get'em in the middle of a bomb
Put'em on the spot till the funk go pop and
I bet he never have another quam
Tech nizzle, when I'm thizzled
It's who be you rollin' with
Dave, Trav, Violet Brown and three Q
Hootie hoo, for those who not knowing
That mizzou thee true
I'mma tell ya like the Swedish would say it

I do hip hop
And I mix it with the hard rock
Designing this rhyming for climbing
Tech N9NE he's unwinding
The shining it's blinding
Greedy so we constantly grinding
I been in the game sixteen years making rap tunes
Raising hella havoc up in the classroom
Now in 02 you can watch me clownin'
Diamonds shining watchin' DVD's
On the Hachitachi
It's all Jesus, now I keep the crowds pumpin' they
Jumpin' get back to the tele we rollin' and stickin'
Somethin' racing to the main line absolute power
Is having Halle Berry and Juliet Lewis at the same time
Oh that's how strange niggas run
Listen to the villain with the gun associated tongue
(We're close to the end)
But not done the Tech's just began begun
Beginning to begin to have fun
The curse, is tryin' to put me in the hearse
But I will not tumble first things first
Took a lot of shit and I can't take more
Fuck Jay Farries and everybody
Down wit'em and fuck J Cor

Thanks to strange music
I'm comin' and all my
Enemies they runnin'
Now all my haters bummin'
'Cause I was summoned
We kansas city players
And we 'bout sold game
We make it so that Tech-N9NE is a household name
How many points you got?
I got 50 here's a question to the censorship committee
Who's the biggest gangs of niggas in the city
My villains are gritty
Big scoob, Txx will, Bakarii
Rest in peace short nitty
Power the evil way is power the people say
Rebel yellin' with felons
And my pockets are swellin'
This beats from Berlin, Germany throwin' up mizzizy
So ain't no other city concerning me
I teach it and I speak it very loosely
Stamina gunnin' got player haters running profusely
Now I got the parents pissed and
Ready to noose me, cause they know that
Absolute power corrupts, absolutely
