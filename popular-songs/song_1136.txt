So here you are now, nowhere to turn
It's just the same old yesterday
And you made a promise to yourself
That you were never gonna be this way
And the only thing that you've ever known is to run
So you keep on drivin' faster into the sun
But everybody needs somebody sometimes
Yeah, everybody needs somebody sometimes
You don't have to find your own way out
You've got a voice, let it be heard
Just when it feels you're on a dead-end road
There's always somewhere left to turn
So don't give up now, you're so close to a brand new day, yes, you are
And if you just can't bare to be alone then I'll stay
'Cause everybody needs somebody sometimes
Yeah, everybody needs somebody sometimes
Well, maybe I've been too caught up
To see what you've been going through
All that I can say is I'm here now
And everybody needs somebody sometimes, you know they do
Everybody needs somebody sometimes
Everybody needs somebody sometimes
Everybody needs somebody sometimes
Gotta have someone beside you
Gotta have someone beside you
Yes, you do, yes, you do, everybody
Everybody needs somebody sometimes
