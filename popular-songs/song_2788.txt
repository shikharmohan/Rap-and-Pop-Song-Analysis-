My world revolved around you
Every word was a promise I was hangin' on
Swept up inside a whirlwind
I just couldn't see the end till you were gone
Oh, I thought I would fall apart
With shattered dreams and a broken heart
Scramblin' in the dark
How was I to know that I'd be okay
Thought I'd lose it all when you walked away
How was I to know I would be the strong
I had what it takes all along
How was I to know
What I was so afraid of
Turned out to be my freedom in disguise
Now I know what I'm made of
Guess it just took some time to realize
Oh, I was blind I couldn't tell
Put too much faith in someone else
I gave up on myself
How was I to know that I'd be okay
Thought I'd lose it all when you walked away
How was I to know I would be the strong
I had what it takes all along
How was I to know
How was I to know that I'd be okay
Thought I'd lose it all when you walked away
How was I to know I would be the strong
I had what it takes all along
How was I to know, how was I to know
