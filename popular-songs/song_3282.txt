[1st verse]
I want you to quit
Calling me
Calling me
Following me
Following me
Why do you trip with me
After you get through
Swallowing me
Never knew this bianca
Would explode
Like this
Now that I know this
I must reload
Gat clips
How many ever met a
Psycho bitch
Down for the minute
But a major twist
Came
With a bit of game
Met that bitch
Sickness
Everybody peep
The evil symptoms
So you'll know
When sexual activity happens
And tears start to flow
Time to go
They come with a
Big package in back
Chest is twice that
But the fatal attraction
Will only get you
Ice packs
Better watch what you do
When you sleep with a woman
That's on the edge
In your bed
Cause you'll be resting
In red
Killa killa
They'll find the number
To your residence
Non-hesitant
Unprecedented
Ain't no mystery
To her steez
She's demented
I ain't never gonna get myself
In another mix up
With a psycho bitch
Millimeter
With a master plan
So you won't be off in a ditch
Like this
Wild child
Running wild
Behind the smile
Is a frown
That'll make you lay it down
Quickly
She's shifty
Killa strictly
Outta come and get me
From a rose
To a three fifty-seven
Three sixty
Psycho bitch
[hook 1]
Never ever do it
Down low
With a psycho bitch
Better never ever go out
With a
Psycho bitch
Everybody better learn
How to see a
Psycho bitch
Cause your bitch might be her
[hook 2]
What you gonna do when they
Pop at you
Gloc at you
Fill 'em with the venom
Who the fuck
Are we talking to psycho bitches, psycho bitches
[repeat 2x]
[2nd verse]
I was holding her
Hugging her
Rubbing her
Sucking her
Kissing her
Plugging her
But she thought
That I was
Loving her
All the loving was gone
When she found out
She was wrong
Calling my momma's house
At three a.m.
Quit playing on my phone
They say this
Psycho bitch
Was made from us
Psycho bitches
Say they get nothing
But hate from us
Psycho bitches
From the angelic to ravenous
Psycho bitches
Stay the fuck
Away from us
Psycho bitches
She got my
Gas cut off
But i
Don't know how
She got my
Phone cut off
But i
Don't know how
Bitch even got my
Lights cut off
But i
Don't know how
Wish I knew back then
What a
Nigga know now crazy bitch
Followed me to my
Main thang's domain
This dame
Brings more pain
Door chain
Broke after the door rang
Must be on cocaine
Insane
Yanks will mess up
Your thang
No brain bitches
Will have you stressing
Using rogaine
Didn't chill with her
Deal with her
N9na had to get
Ill with her
Trick tried to kill
Mrs. n9ne
So I had to hit her
With a grill splitter
Never do sex
With a psycho bianc
Anybody with her
Better pop your trunk
Run better get a gun
When the bitch come
Better know
She's a psycho killa
Killa
Hard
When he hit that piece
And then get her up
And out
With a dis
Scarred
When he knows
That he's been up in the mix
With a psycho bitch
[repeat 2x]
[hook 1]
Never ever do it
Down low
With a psycho bitch
Better never ever go out
With a
Psycho bitch
Everybody better learn
How to see a
Psycho bitch
Cause your bitch might be her
[hook 2]
What you gonna do when they
Pop at you
Gloc at you
Fill "em with the venom
Who the fuck
Are we talking to
[repeat 2x]
[3rd verse]
As the
Smoke clears you wonder why this woman
Packs the
Most fear
She keeps a broken heart
And a three eighty
Close near
From me to you
If you sense
She's psychotic
Better watch what you do
What they do
They say this
Psycho bitch
Was made from us psycho bitches
Say they get nothing
But hate from us psycho bitches
From angelic to ravenous psycho bitches
Stay the fuck
Away from us psycho bitches
