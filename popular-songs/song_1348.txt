I see how you're tryin' to
Weasel your way and boy I
Know how you maneuver
With your, your confusion
You tell me that I'm your only
And how bad that you want me
Then why are you so shady?
If I'm supposed to be your lady
Why should I believe?
Anything you say
And how could you shame me
That way?
Tell me where
Where'd you get the nerve
To even think that you
You could play me, boy?
You thought we didn't know
You thought we were in the dark
But boy your cover's blown
'Cause we both know now
You thought you had us both
At your beck and call
But now who's the joke?
And look who's laughin' now
Now you're tryin' to use us, a
Against one another but it won't work
I see right through your game, boy
And I know exactly what I came for
You, you try to deny all your actions
For once in your life be a real man
At least give me the proper respect of
The truth I already know you did it
Why should I believe?
Anything you say
And how could you shame me
That way?
Tell me where
Where'd you get the nerve
To even think that you
You could play me, boy?
You thought we didn't know
You thought we were in the dark
But boy you're cover's blown
'Cause we both know now
You thought you had us both
At your beck and call
But now who's the joke?
And look who's laughin' now
I see right through you, baby
Tried to tell me you want me
Can't you just get it through your
Get it through your thick, thick, thick, thick head?
'Cause I've seen this game before and
I'm showin' you the door so
Shut your mouth
I'm not tryin' to hear your lies no, not again
Oh no, not again
Sorry, you couldn't be a better man
Oh oh oh
No no no no no
You thought we didn't know
You thought we were in the dark
But boy your cover's blown
'Cause we both know now
You thought you had us fooled
At your beck and call
But now who's the joke?
And look who's laughin' now
Guess you thought wrong
Look who's laughing now
