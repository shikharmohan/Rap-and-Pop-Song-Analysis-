It's a long trip alone
Over sand and stones
That lie along the road
That we all must travel down
So maybe you could walk with me a while
And maybe I could rest beneath your smile
Everybody stumbles sometimes
And needs a hand to hold
'Cause it's a long trip alone
It's a short piece of time
But just enough to find
A little peace of mind
Under the sun somewhere
So maybe you could walk with me a while
And maybe I could rest beneath your smile
You know we can't afford to let
One moment pass us by
'Cause it's a short piece of time
And I don't know where I'd be
Without you here
'Cause I'm not really me
Without you there
So maybe you could walk with me a while
Maybe I could rest beneath your smile
Everybody stumbles sometimes
And needs a hand to hold
So maybe you could walk with me a while
Maybe I could rest beneath your smile
Maybe I could feel you right beside
'Til I'm home
'Cause it's a long trip alone
A long trip alone
