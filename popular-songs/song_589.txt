Your Relation To Me
Feeds my Empty Existance
I guess I choose what to See
Beause I'm Feeling Resistance
So turn the lights on below
The time we have is too precious
You Said that you'd never go
I know that lying is infeccious
So Don't Let me down...
Breaking My All rules today (Oooh)
I Know that I Should walk away
I'm falling again for someone
Who doesn't feel right
As the Story of My Life
I thought you were ready to be
Starting my happy ending
Sometimes I choose what to see
Forget what I've been defending
Before the day fades today
It comes a break In the weather
I made you say goodbye
'Cause I can't say forever (No...)
So Don't let me down...
No...
Breaking My All rules today (Oooh)
I Know that I Should walk away (Oooh)
I'm falling again for someone
Who doesn't feel right
As the Story of My Life
One in a million
But if you're ready to listen
I Know that I can stubbern
Maybe it's me, But I've been to blind to see
Breaking My All rules today (Oooh)
I Know that I Should walk away (Oooh)
I'm falling again for someone
Who doesn't feel right
As the Story of My Life
Keep Walking...
I Keel Walking
Keep Walking...
I Keel Walking
Keep Walking...
I Keel Walking
As The Story Of My Life
