Congratulations you have won
It's a year's subscription of bad puns
And it makes your story of concern
And you set it up before it burns
My opinions, mmm, mmm
My opinions, mmm, mmm
My opinions, mmm, mmm
My opinions, mmm, mmm
And there seems to be a problem here
And the state of emotion seems too clear
Now you rise and fall like Wall Street stock
And they have an affect on our peace talk
Our opinions, mmm, mmm
Our opinions, mmm, mmm
Our opinions, mmm, mmm
Our opinions, mmm, mmm
Well congratulations you have won
It's a year's subscription of bad puns
And it makes your story of concern
And you set it up before it burns
And your opinions, mmm, mmm
Your opinions, mmm, mmm
Your opinions, mmm, mmm
Your opinions, mmm, mmm
Your opinions
