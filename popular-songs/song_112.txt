It was two weeks after the day she turned 18
All dressed in white, going to the church that night
She had his box of letter sitting the passenger seat
Six pins in her shoe
Something borrowed, something blue
And when the church doors opened up wide
She put her veil down trying to hide the tears
Oh, she just couldn't believe it
She heard the trumpets from the military band
And the flowers laying in her hands
Baby, why'd you have to leave me? Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe, it's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now
This can't be happening to me, this is just a dream
The preacher man said, "Let's bow our head and pray
Lord, please lift his soul and heal this hurt"
Then the congregation all stood up and sang the saddest song
That she ever heard then they handed her a folded up flag
And she held on to all she had left of him
And what could've been and then guns rang one last shot
And it felt like a bullet in her heart
Baby, why'd you have to leave me? Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
Oh, I'll never know, it's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now
This can't be happening to me, this is just a dream
Oh, this is just a dream, just a dream
(Ya)
