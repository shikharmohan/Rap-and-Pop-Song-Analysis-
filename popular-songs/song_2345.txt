[Verse 1:]
Baby did you miss me?
Y'know things have changed.
But, I'm telling you that it ain't over.
Ha, You see these feelings.
Your feelings ain't got no feet to walk away
Yeah Yeah
See, I know you got him.
But, ain't no thang
See I wrote the book, you can't just turn the page.
But, it seems to me, as you look closer.
That you 'gon start to see it my way
[Chorus:]
Ohh, he can run wit' cha.
Lay wit' cha.
Im gonna stay wit' cha.
And we gon' always have our secret love.
Can't turn away, O's here to stay.
There's no getting over it.
He can be wit' cha.
Commend wit' cha
But, I'm gonna leave wit' cha.
And we gon' always have our secret love.
You ain't gon' change, O's here to stay.
There's no getting over it, girl.
[Verse 2:]
Won't see me laughin', cos it ain't no game.
If I walk out the door, you'll never be the same.
You can try if you gonna.
Stay away if you wanna.
It's waiting and you don't wanna lose.
Ain't no way, I know.
It's some things, I know
Ain't nobody do it like me. Ohh yeah!
Don't ask the question.
Cos you know that answer is me, baby.
[Chorus:]
Ohh, he can run wit' cha.
Lay wit' cha.
Im gonna stay wit' cha.
And we gon' always have our secret love.
Can't turn away, O's here to stay.
There's no getting over it.
He can be wit' cha.
Commend wit' cha
But, I'm gonna leave wit' cha.
And we gon' always have our secret love.
You ain't gon' change, O's here to stay.
There's no getting over it, girl.
[Verse 3:]
No matter if the world stop spinnin', girl
For you and me, time's there's still
And I know you won't admit
But, I know it from the kiss, ohh baby.
We'll always be, you and me
So you and him won't be more than jealous, admit.
So baby don't you doubt.
Ain't gon' turn you out
Go 'head look at me.
There's no getting over it, girl.
[Chorus:]
Ohh, he can run wit' cha.
Lay wit' cha.
Im gonna stay wit' cha.
And we gon' always have our secret love.
Can't turn away, O's here to stay.
There's no getting over it.
He can be wit' cha.
Commend wit' cha (oh)
But, I'm gonna leave wit' cha.
And we gon' always have our secret love.
You ain't gon' change, O's here to stay.
There's no getting over it, girl.
[Ending]
He can run wit' cha
Lay wit' cha
Sit you on my bed .. (there's no getting over it, girl)
