Everyday I swim an ocean
Fightin' your memory like endless waves
I surrender to the truth, I'll always love you
But I know someday, I'm gonna reach the banks
Of a distant shore where I won't miss you anymore
Once in a while I ride the river
Of whiskey wishes from an old shot glass
But the way it used to be follows me downstream
So I keep knockin' 'em back till I reach the banks
Of a distant shore, where I won't miss you anymore
Someday I'm gonna get there
It might take my last prayer
One of these days I'm gonna cross that ocean
Some sweet angel will set me free
And they'll tell my stories, sing a song about glory
And read Psalm 23 when I reach the banks
Of that distant shore, where I won't miss you anymore
Gonna rest my soul in the hands of the Lord
Where I won't miss you anymore
