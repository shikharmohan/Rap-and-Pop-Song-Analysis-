Ooh, I promise not to do it again
I promise not to do it
You can't say I don't love you
Just because I cheat on you
'Cuz you can't see all I do
To keep you from knowing the things I do
Like erase my phone and keep it out of town
I keep it strapped up when I sleep around
Well I should have known one day you'd find out
But you can't go and leave me now
You know that I love you
There's no one above you
I said it the last time
But this is the last time
Don't make me over
'Cuz I can be faithful
Baby, you're my number one
You're my number one
Now, who is she? What's her name?
You don't need to know about everything
We fight about this, we fight about that
You hang up the phone and call me right back
Well I'll never be something I'm not
Please don't throw away what we've got
'Cuz we've been together for way too long
I was playing around but I'm coming home
You know that I love you
(Know that I love you)
There's no one above you
(No one above you)
I said it the last time
(Hey, hey)
But this is the last time
Don't make me over
(Don't leave me baby
'Cuz I can be faithful
(You know I try)
Baby, you're my number one
(Baby)
You're my number one
I keep you laced up so you ain't gotta borrow nothing
From them broke ass friends who be bargain hunting
They say they shop on Ebay, baby why is they frontin'?
They be on the internet but they never cop nothin'
I keep you in girl, what is those on your toes?
And your neck staying froze off that rose colored gold
I suppose you was told by them hoes I was cheatin'
Thinkin' my heart don't got nothing to do with my penis
He got a mind of his own and he just be saying shit
And I don't wanna cheat but I don't be saying shit
I try to jack off, he ask me, "Who is you playin' wit?"
But I know he love you, he told me you was his favorite
You know that I love you
(Know that I love you)
There's no one above you
(No one above you)
I said it the last time
(Said it the last time)
But this is the last time
(Hey hey hey, yeah)
Don't make me over
(Don't leave me baby)
'Cuz I can be faithful
(You know I try)
Baby you're my number one
(Oh baby)
You're my number one
You're making it hard for me
You're messing up everything
You tell me I gotta leave
(Say we over)
You saw that she came over
Came in the Range Rover
Left with a hangover
(Say we over)
I promise I won't cheat
I promise I won't lie
I promise I'll act right
(Say we over)
You can't tell me
I can't have you
I can't have that
(We ain't over)
Hey, it ain't over baby
(We ain't over)
Oh, you don't need to go, it's not over
(We ain't over)
Oh
(We ain't over)
Oh, it's gonna be alright now, don't go now
