Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by the choir
Folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Helps to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa Claus is on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you
Oh, and so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
And although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas, merry Christmas to you, oh yeah
Merry Christmas
