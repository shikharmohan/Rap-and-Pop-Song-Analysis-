Mama say, "Stop," or I'm gonna tell Papa
Mama say, "Stop," or I'm gonna tell Papa
This is the town where the clowns put it down, baby
Mama say, "Stop," or I'm gonna tell Papa
Close the door, before ya child hear the sound, baby
Mama say, "Stop," or I'm gonna tell Papa
The killa clowns, in your town, raisin' all hell
Tecca Nina with the stamina comin' to damage ya buckin'
The bammer, when I bust with a bang
An' it ain't no clause, that say fraud, ain't no tall tales
Women love it when I hit, when I covet the booty
They givin' it to me but it ain't no thang
We reppin' K.C.M.O. fellas an' the ladies know
That we comin' with the killas, I'm with the gorillas
The villains will get you when you disrespect us
Even the babies know Tech Nina got crazy flow
We be givin' the women the willy, we sick of the haterz
Wanna pay us? Go to get this record
This is important, we be courtin' every place we go
Get you up in the room, ain't trippin' off of the groom
I'll give it to you anyway you wanna have it
Baby, is a horse an' yes of course, I'mma have to break the ho'
Leavin' the kids at home, I wanna bone alone
We hoppin' up an' down like jack rabbits
So many kids put this on their daddy's mind
Never will I ever put him out there like that feelin'
That I did Tecca Nina, take it right back
Tellin' him that the Mommy's boyfriend's Tech N9ne
Do be lookin' at me like you really wanna fight
Cat all Tecca Nina, wanna know is where the mic at?
This is the town where the clowns put it down, baby
Mama say, "Stop," or I'm gonna tell Papa
Close the door, before ya child hear the sound, baby
Mama say, "Stop," or I'm gonna tell Papa
This is the town where the clowns put it down, baby
Mama say, "Stop," or I'm gonna tell Papa
Close the door, before ya child hear the sound, baby
Mama say, "Stop," or I'm gonna tell Papa

Sayin' that we got dropped from JCOR
That never ever would happen, I mean, what do they know?
We kept our head up, now money's comin' to us all
We kickin' it with strange, wallowin' in fame
Givin' the game only when I say so
So crack some bub wit me, demons, get some  love wit me
Do what you gotta do to get what you gotta get
I gotta get it all, Tecca Nina's on a roll
Get on some shrub wit me two cases of Bud wit me
What you gonna do to get the women on krunk

This is the town where the clowns put it down, baby
Close the door, before ya child hear the sound, baby
This is the town where the clowns put it down, baby
Teasin' your chakra an' ain't nobody hotter
Close the door, before ya child hear the sound, baby

One an' then comes the two to the three an'
That was the anthem, now this the anthem
Hella rockin' the planet again, you can't stand it again
Huns, they been comin' through to see me, man
Then I de-pants 'em an' I bust they Randon in the bed
I'mma land 'em, dog, gwamn it, I ram it again
Raves, I love to get high an' get paid
Why do I wanna stick 'em with another hit up
Out of Abyss, baby, ya don't wanna miss the tits
Babes, they love to come by an' get laid
Why am I the pinnacle? When I rip it I'mma
Kill 'em in this, to the haters, I gotta send 'em a gift
Bump this in your ride or in the club
Givin' everybody what they need I give it all
So they give it all back to me
Hataz, don't you hide, just show some love
Do you dig it? I'mma rep the B an' never ever let the
C get the best of me
So many kids put this on their daddy's mind
Never will I put him out there like that feelin'
That I did, Tecca Nina take it right back
Tellin' him their mommy's boyfriend is Tech N9ne
Oh no, girl, yo baby's at the door
This is the town where the clowns put it down, baby
Close the door, before ya child hear the sound, baby

So when you pump it once, press the instant replay
Teasin' your chakra an' ain't nobody hotter
Mama say, "Stop," or I'm gonna tell Papa
This is the town where the clowns put it down, baby
Mama say, "Stop," or I'm gonna tell Papa
Close the door, before ya child hear the sound, baby
Mama, open this door
