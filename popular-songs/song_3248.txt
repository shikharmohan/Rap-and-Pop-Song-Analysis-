[Oobie:]
I'm see'n me on top of you
Doing things that lovers do
But I don't belong to you
Whats a girl suppose to do
only need one night with you
To make all our dreams come true
You could never be my man,
You can be my one night stand
[Oobie/Chorus]
Boy I know you got a girl
And you know I've got a man
So lets both respect the game
And have a one night stand
Everybody wanna know 
But they wouldn't understand
So lets keep it on the low
And have a one night stand
Well it's about a quarter to three and,
No ones lookin',
Its just you and me
You know I'm down for whatever
And I aim to please
But its only for this one night
Boy I hope you come well prepared
Cause I want you to know that 
I ain't ever scared
You just make the RSVP 
And I'll be there
But its only for this one night
[Chorus]
Boy I know you got a girl
And you know I've got a man
So lets both respect the game
And have a one night stand
Everybody wanna know 
But they wouldn't understand
So lets keep it on the low
And have a one night stand
