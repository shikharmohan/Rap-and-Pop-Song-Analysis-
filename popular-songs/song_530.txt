My lawnmower home but my hoe still missin'
My hoe still missin', my hoe still missin'
My rake in the shed but my hoe still missin'
My hoe still missin', my hoe still missin'
Plowin' the world but my hoe still missin'
My hoe still missin', my hoe still missin'
I'm 'bout to lose my head 'cause my hoe still missin'
Like it's greener on the other side
I take care of the yard everyday
I don't know why my hoe got missin'
My rake in good condition
My lawnmower in position
I ain't done a damn thing wrong
For my hoe to get up and get missin'
Now I'd be wrong if I was to dig up the dirt
I done saw for myself and witnessed
Boy, I'd tell you about my hoe
Never had restrictions
I guess, more green was her attention
I shoulda kept that hoe in the kitchen
Got me on a mission
Left my shed without permission
I'm sheddin' tears messin' up my vision
This hoe gon' make me go to prison
My lawnmower home but my hoe still missin'
My hoe still missin', my hoe still missin'
My rake in the shed but my hoe still missin'
My hoe still missin', my hoe still missin'
Plowin' the world but my hoe still missin'
My hoe still missin', my hoe still missin'
I'm 'bout to lose my head 'cause my hoe still missin'
Like it's greener on the other side
That hoe cost me my job
I'm afraid I shoulda learned mo' 'bout the business
A hoe is good for diggin'
I shoulda known this from the beginnin'
I done got caught slippin' now I'm trippin'
Out the do' somebody else found interest
On my hoe until I found out different
Better to know then have intuitions
Who been in my yard?
Why would anybody split us apart?
I never thought that hoe would get to my heart
I found out right off a bitch can't pull apart
Why this hoe went in somebody garage?
I was a gentlemen right from the start
Ever since I put the hoe in my Dodge
Now this hoe won't even spare me the rod
My lawnmower home but my hoe still missin'
My hoe still missin', my hoe still missin'
My rake in the shed but my hoe still missin'
My hoe still missin', my hoe still missin'
Plowin' the world but my hoe still missin'
My hoe still missin', my hoe still missin'
I'm 'bout to lose my head 'cause my hoe still missin'
Like it's greener on the other side
Seven years now it's all over
Now hold on, go on you gotta feel me bruh
Left my home no sign of luck
I try to drink Patron so all the memories gone
All the pain I'm trying to pour it in my cup
Bought the hoe my last couple of bucks
Lost a hoe, I never felt this crush
Like Kush in a dutch, never this much
If I woulda known my hoe was just temporary
And I ain't talkin' 'bout the hoe you find in the dictionary
I feel like goin' to war like the military
Somebody gon' have to visit the cemetery
My lawnmower home but my hoe still missin'
My hoe still missin', my hoe still missin'
My rake in the shed but my hoe still missin'
My hoe still missin', my hoe still missin'
Plowin' the world but my hoe still missin'
My hoe still missin', my hoe still missin'
I'm 'bout to lose my head 'cause my hoe still missin'
Like it's greener on the other side
