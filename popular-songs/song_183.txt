Tuxedo waiters, black ties
White tablecloths and red wine
We've been plannin' this night
Lookin' forward to it for some time
Honey, I know you love gettin' dressed up
And you know I love showin' you off
Watchin' your baby blue eyes
Dancin' in the candlelight glow
All I can think about is gettin' you home
Walkin' through the front door
Seein' your black dress hit the floor
Honey there sure ain't nothing
Like you lovin' me all night long
And all I can think about is gettin' you home
I don't need this menu, no I don't
I already know just what I want
Did I hear you right? Did you tell me
Go pay the waiter and let's leave?
Honey, I know by that look in your eyes
And your hand drawin' hearts onto mine
That our night out of the house
Ain't gonna last too long
When all you can think about is gettin' me home
Walkin' through the front door
Seein' your black dress hit the floor
Honey there sure ain't nothing
Like you lovin' me all night long
And all I can think about is gettin' you home
Walkin' through the front door
Seein' your black dress hit the floor
Honey there sure ain't nothing
Like you lovin' me all night long
And all I can think about is gettin' you home
