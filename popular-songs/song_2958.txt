Every time I turn the conversation
To something deeper than the weather
I can feel you always shuttin' down
And when I need an explanation for the silence
You just tell me you don't wanna talk about it now
What you're not saying is coming in loud and clear
We're at a crossroads here
If I'm not the one thing you can't stand to lose
If I'm not that arrow to the heart of you
If you don't get drunk on my kiss
If you think you can do better than this
Then I guess, we're done, let's not drag this on
Consider me gone
With you I've always been wide open
Like a window or an ocean
There is nothing I've ever tried to hide
So when you leave me not knowin' where you're goin'
I start thinkin' that we're lookin', we're lookin' at goodbye
How about a strong shot of honesty?
Don't you owe that to me?
If I'm not the one thing you can't stand to lose
If I'm not that arrow to the heart of you
If you don't get drunk on my kiss
If you think you can do better than this
Then I guess, we're done, let's not drag this on
Consider me gone
Consider me a memory, consider me the past
Consider me a smile in an old photograph
Someone who used to make you laugh
If I'm not the one thing you can't stand to lose
If I'm not that arrow to the heart of you
Then I guess, we're done, let's not drag this on
Consider me gone, consider me gone
Consider me gone, just consider me gone
