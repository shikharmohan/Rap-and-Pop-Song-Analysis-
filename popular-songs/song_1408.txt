It's the third thatched roof on the right
Right beside crystal blue water
First wave of the day, almost got away
But my sailboard caught her
Funny when you called
I was thinking how good it'd be to see you again
The key's in the conch shell, come on in
Been here about a month
Not doing much of nothin at all
Dogding Man O' Wars
Man, it's hard to get bored when you're having a ball
Make yourself at home
There's a good chance I'll be gone reelin' one in
Girl, the key's in the conch shell, come on in
Don't bring nothin' but that sunshine smile
Come on baby stay awhile, stay awhile
My favorite bar's in view
Worked there a day or two just to cover my tab
And other than that
Ain't cost me a dime for the time I've had
The only thing I need
Is some company from where have you been
Girl, the key's in the conch shell, come on in
Make yourself at home
There's a good chance I'll be gone reelin' one in
Girl, the key's in the conch shell, come on in
