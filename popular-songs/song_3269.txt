I brought a bat to a mosh-pit 
(Layzie - Well what you do then??) 
I split some craniums in half 
And caved a few in 
Before long I'm standing there alone 
I shut the party down 
For Bone Thugs, Tech N9ne, Kottonmouth and Esham 
(Layzie Bone) 
In...coming, I'm running and dropping them bombs 
Still gunning, I'm willing and ready for war 
Get down with the clowns from ICP, B-O-N-E 
And the Kottonmouth Kings, bring it how we bring it doe 
For the wicked wonka, Halloween

All the bitches on the road, scheming for my loot 
They get nothing but dick, and a steel toed boot 
(Esham) 
Fuck Proof, every Halloween, I dress like a bag lady 
Then I ride around with my .380 looking for Shady 
If I catch him at the shelter, I'ma pull his file 
Chop his head off, and bury his body across 8 mile
