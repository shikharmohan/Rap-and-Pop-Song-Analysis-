I'm on my time with everyone
I have very bad posture
I sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
Distill the life that's inside of me
I sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
I'm anemic royalty
Give me a Leonard Cohen afterworld
So I can sigh eternally
I'm so tired I can't sleep
I'm a liar and a thief
I sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
I'm anemic royalty
I'm on warm milk and laxatives
Cherry flavored antacids
I sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
Distill the life that's inside of me
I sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
I'm anemic royalty
