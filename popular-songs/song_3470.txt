On a lover's leap
With a freeway view
Sittin' on my hood
Thinkin' bout you
Going over in my mind
Every kiss and every fight
Yeah, the fool on the hill
Is beating down another night
There were days so hard
I thought I had to go
I'd get in my car
And just follow the road
But this is my home
And it's who I am
And I know I'd stay
If I could make this
Old town new again
Color other than blue again
I'd have something to do again
Instead of thinkin' about you again
But the people I know, the places I go
Remind me of you
Oh, somebody come around
And make this old town new
There were nights so long
I thought the sun burned out
And there were girls so wrong
I don't wanna talk about
I was burning up the night
Yeah, in an alcohol flame
Lightin' up my way
Trying to make this
Old town new again
Color other than blue again
I'd have something to do again
Instead of thinkin' about you again
But the people I know the places I go
Remind me of you
Won't somebody come around?
And make this old town new
Yeah, the people I know and
The places I go remind me of you
Oh, love goes wrong but life goes on
And I know what I gotta do
I'm just hangin' around
Tryin' to make this old town new
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, won't you come on, come on
Come on, come on around here?
Hey, won't you come on, come on
Come on, won't somebody come around here please?
