He made it so hard to trust someone
He made it so hard to fall in love
Not tryna mess up this relationship, thinkin'
'Cuz the last man did me that way, you gon' do the same things
I don't wanna be this way but I'm hoping you can change
The way that I feel
You see I trusted him with everything
Never held back anything thought we'd be together for the rest of our lives
So suddenly he took his love away
And made it hard to trust again
I know I've been holding back but he really hurt me bad
I don't wanna take my past and put it all on you
I'm not tryna hold you back, really hope you understand
I don't know what I'm gonna do
When I think of what he did to me, makes it hard to fall in love
When I think about just what I need, makes it hard to trust someone
Baby I gotta let go, don't wanna miss out on love this time
Gotta leave those things behind
Whatever's yours you call it ours send flowers
With love you keep me showered but so did my ex-man at first
You see what started out so simple, all flew out the window
There I go comparing you to him again
It keeps holding me down, I gotta let it go
I wanna give love a chance 'cuz you may never know
Baby you can be the the one for me, yes, the only one for me
And I don't want to lose a good thing, no
I know I've been holding back but he really hurt me bad
I don't wanna take my past and put it all on you
I'm not tryna hold you back, really hope you understand
I don't know what I'm gonna do
When I think of what he did to me, makes it hard to fall in love
When I think about just what I need, makes it hard to trust someone
Baby I gotta let go, don't wanna miss out on love this time
Gotta leave those things behind
One disappointment, one heart break
To many mistakes in love I've made
I can't come with all this baggage thinking he's gonna have it
See I know I'm being selfish but I gotta let it go
Close that chapter, close that book
Faith in love is all it ever took
That's why I never gave up and never gave in
'Cuz I know true love is waitin' for me again
I know I've been holding back but he really hurt me bad
I don't wanna take my past and put it all on you
I'm not tryna hold you back, really hope you understand
I don't know what I'm gonna do
When I think of what he did to me, makes it hard to fall in love
When I think about just what I need, makes it hard to trust someone
Baby I gotta let go, don't wanna miss out on love this time
Gotta leave those things behind
He made it so hard to trust someone
He made it so hard to fall in love
