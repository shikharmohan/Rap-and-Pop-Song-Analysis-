Verse 1: (Jamie Madrox) 
What is it about a serial killa that attracts you? 
And makes this music that you can sharpen an axe to 
Taking you back through a hallway to a black room 
No walls or ceilings, just doorways to pass through 
You choose: chainsaws are always nice 
But razorblades and knives are way more precise 
When it comes to cutting, this shit here is an art 
And we finish what we start, that's what separates us apart 
From other mother fuckers, not saying no names 
But them other mother fuckers (They ain't family!) 
And they say I'm sick, too sick. 
Well how sick do you get 
When you see a chest without a butcher knife buried in it 
Wait a minute, gimme an axe 
I wanna smash your ribcage in half 
For every time you laughed on our behalf 
Will you let me another chance to redefine 
The mind of a serial killa 
Chorus: (2x) 
Serial killa 
K I double L A! 
Fruit looped outta my mind like Godzilla 
*scream* (Kill) 
Serial killa! (Killa, Killa) 
Torture and destroy (Killa, Killa) 
Serial killa! (Killa, Killa)
Verse 2: (Monoxide Child) 
Could it be the blood? Maybe it's the blood you like 
Or maybe it's my blatant disregard for life 
Most people are afraid to deny it 
But not me though 
I keep it old school like a mink coat 
Rusty blade, at least 12 inches 
With the tipped cracked off from stabbin' too many bitches 
I'm digging ditches with a mental mind state 
??? 
Throw ya ?? on the head of my axe 
And pray to god I don't split you in half like train tracks 
I can't control it, so I just put it in my music 
And hopefully other killas can use it 
Don't confuse it with the same old game 
Cause the shit that I kick could put a glitch in your mainframe 
Wicked to the bone I am 
And you can meet me in the dark if you think I'm playing, what!
Chorus: (2x) 
Serial killa 
K I double L A! 
Fruit looped outta my mind like Godzilla 
*scream* (Kill) 
Serial killa! (Killa, Killa) 
Torture and destroy (Killa, Killa) 
Serial killa! (Killa, Killa)
Verse 3: (Tech N9ne & Jamie Madrox) 
Who's the real killa? 
Who's the mother fucka ya love and I hate 
But in the midst will fuck with real millas 
Trust ya bitch. We'll jock. You'll trip. 
We'll shock with pistol cocked! (This the shit to knock!) 
Who am I!? 
Amerikilla, gorilla, the Juggalizzle my nizzle 
With Psychopathic I'm rapping, we set to gangrene 
Killa killa, the realla, banana fanna I feela 
Nigga with a millimeter with the infrared beam 
The axe is family, and for the family 
I use the axe to separate your anatomy 
Ain't no being mad at me, the shit ain't even worth it 
I said I was a serial killa, not perfect 
It's not my fault that I can't be trusted 
And people like me aren't all disgusting 
Some will slit necks and into skull crushing 
And killing people over next to nothing mother fucker!
Chorus: (2x) 
Serial killa 
K I double L A! 
Fruit looped outta my mind like Godzilla 
*scream* (Kill) 
Serial killa! (Killa, Killa) 
Torture and destroy (Killa, Killa) 
Serial killa! (Killa, Killa)
