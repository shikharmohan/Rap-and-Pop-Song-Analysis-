Uh
[Spoken]
R-E-S-P-E-C-T Give yo girl RESPECT (uh)
It's ya girl Ciara
Futuristic
And the Corner Boys
That's right
Listen
[Verse]
First of all change, Your tone
Come correct when you talk to me
'cause I am not some old, silly girl that u can mistreat
I have a mind, of my own
And there'll be times when we disagree
But if you're not, in control
Then your just ready to throw it all away
[Hook]
Hey now wait a minute baby
See there's no need from u to be this way
'cause I am ur lady
I never thought that you would be soo..
[Chorus]
Insecure
Betta watch the way you talk to me
Won't take no more
'cause all I need for you is a little
Respect (uh huh)
Just a little respect (uh huh)
Just a little respect 
Just a little bit, hope u handle this
Who u talking to (huh)
[Verse]
Don't misunderstand, what I mean
When I say I'm trying to do me
You shouldn't be so unsure
And cause Beef everytime I leave
I do appreciate,everything that you do for me
Try not to sufficate
You need to give your girl some time to breate
[Hook]
Hey now wait a minute baby
See there's no need for u to be this way
'cause I am ur lady
I never thought that you would be soo..
[Chorus]
Insecure
Betta watch the way you talk to me
Won't take no more
'cause all I need from you is a little
Respect (uh huh)
Just a little respect (uh huh)
Just a little respect 
Just a little bit, hope u handle this
Who u talking to (huh)
[Verse]
I'm trying (I'm trying)
My hardest (My hardest)
To keep you around (hey hey hey)
When I'm talkin (when I'm talkin)
Just listen (Just listen)
Boy please hear me out (hey hey hey)
The problems (the problems)
I'm solving (I'm solving)
The best way I know how (oh oh oh)
The only way to work this out is
You can't be so..
