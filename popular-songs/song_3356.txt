Maybe it was a dream last night
Or looking into my daughter's eyes
But my heart was sinking
Yeah, man, it got me thinking
About all of my yesterdays
Every minute, every page of my innocence
Wishing I could go back when
I was wild and free as the Mississippi
Playing in the sugar cane
A part of me is gone
I don't know when it slipped away
I guess I left it in Louisiana
Blowing in the wind
Hiding in the quarter
Gotta get back there again
To the sweet sounds of the bayou
Let it wash right over me
Make me whole again
Bring back that missing piece
That I left in Louisiana
Well, I still feel the same
But the mirror tells me that I've changed
Every morning it's like a subtle warning
It comes on like a delta rain
Soaks through my skin down to my vein
And it leaves me breathless
And a little restless
Reminding me that life is so fragile
Like a thin sheet of a glass
The moment you're living right now
Will soon become your past
And I left it in Louisiana
Blowing in the wind
Hiding in the quarter
Gotta get back there again
To the sweet sounds of the bayou
Let it wash right over me
Make me whole again
Bring back that missing piece
That I left in Louisiana
But every night I close my eyes
And I go walking under that magnolia sky
That I left it in Louisiana
Blowing in the wind
Hiding in the quarter
Gotta get back there again
To the sweet sounds of the bayou
Let it wash right over me
Make me whole again
Bring back that missing piece
That I left in Louisiana
Louisiana
