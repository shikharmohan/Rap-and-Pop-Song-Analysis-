She was aware of her insecurities as she took the stage
She was convinced if she got up there
That she would be discovered someday
So she belted it, she hit the high notes fearlessly
Oh she melted then, as she brought them to their feet
She was a big star at Banana Joe's Bar
Where she sang karaoke every night
She said, "If you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight"
She was a big star
She made the local cable shows where the camera fell in love with her face
After a couple of weekends the groupies were crawlin' all over the place
She signed autographs like she was Garth Brooks in a skirt
And in the aftermath, that small time town was hers
She was a big star at Banana Joe's Bar
Where she sang karaoke every night
She said, "If you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight"
She was a big star
She doesn't care anymore that her high school girlfriends cut her down
They only thought she entertain is where they are and where she is now
All her old neighbors swear they're certain she slept her way to the top
She knows you don't get where your going
Unless you got something they ain't got
So she sings tonight to 20,000 plus
And the young girls scream out loud, "Man that could be us"
She's a big star and she eats caviar
Just before she performs every night
She says, "If you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight"
She's a big star, she's a big star
