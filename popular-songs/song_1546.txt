It can make a a man feel like a kid
Or feel just like a clown
It can make him run for cover
Or stay and stand his ground
It can make a man pick up the bottle
Or help him lay it down
It can stop his whole world from turning
Or turn his whole world around
That's the power of a woman
It's the touch of her hand
One smile one tear one whisper in your ear
That's the power of a woman
It can make a man beg for Jesus
Or make him wish he'd never asked
It can make him dream about the future
Or make a nightmare of his past
That's the power of a woman
It's the touch of her hand
One smile one tear one whisper in your ear
That's the power of a woman
She can say so much without saying a word
That's just the power of a woman
It's the touch of her hand
One smile one tear one whisper in your ear 
That's the power of a woman
The power of a woman
She can make you feel like a king or feel just like a clown
