This must be the start, for it cannot be the end
Hold on
Joy said farewell again, went looking for a better friend
Hold on
Bridges call out come to me, come to me
Hold on
Everything's gonna be alright, hold on
Everything's gonna be alright, hold on
This must be the start, it cannot be the end
Hold on
Alone in a big, cold world
Hold on
I see all, yet none see me, can anybody feel me letting go
Hold on
Pills and needles call my name
Hold on
Come, come, we'll give you ease
Hold on
Everything's gonna be alright
Hold on, hold on
This must be the start, it cannot be the end
Hold on
On my knees, please
Hold on
On a bridge, please
Hold on
Was that my name; did I hear you say my name
Hold on, hold on
Let this be the start, it cannot be the end
Hold on, hold on
Everything's gonna be alright
Hold on , hold on . . .
