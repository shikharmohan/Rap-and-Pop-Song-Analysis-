Everyone wants to be like the other
Look around and you will discover
Take a chance and try something different
Don't be scared you might make a difference
Some people might call you crazy
And they may laugh at you and say you's a fool
But you can't care if they say 'cuz
Before you know it they'll be following you
Get in, fit in get out get out
Get in, fit in get out get out
If you want some come get some
You don't want none come get some
Say itche me son, itche me son
Get in, fit in get out get out
Get in, fit in get out get out
Try so hard to copy my style
Take a lesson I'll show you how
But why not try to do somethi' different
Take a chance, you might make a difference
Some people might call you crazy
And they may laugh at you and say you's a fool
But you can't care if they say 'cuz
Before you know it they'll be following you
Get in, fit in get out get out
Get in, fit in get out get out
If you want some come get some
You don't want none come get some
Say itche me son, itche me son
Get in, fit in get out get out
Get in, fit in get out get out
Now this one's for everybody, that's right
I need you to try something different
Now you can move move how you want it
And you can do do what you wanted
That's right, I said it
Get in, fit in get out get out
Get in, fit in get out get out
If you want some come get some
You don't want none come get some
Say iche me son, itche me son
Get in, fit in get out get out
Get in, fit in get out get out
Some people might call you crazy
And they may laugh at you and say you's a fool
But you can't care if they say 'cuz
Before you know it they'll be following you
That's right I'm done
Itche me son, itche me son
Itche me son
Itche me son
Itche me son
