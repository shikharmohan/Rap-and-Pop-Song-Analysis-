It's like I'm lost
I don't know
But this feeling that I have about you
Will you ever know?
Secretly I'm wanting you
And I'm hoping you want me too
I smell your scent across the room
And I can't wait to get next to you
Whatever I see
Whatever I hear
Whatever I do
Oh baby, has got me thinking of you
Secretly I'm wanting you
And I'm hoping you want me too
I smell your scent across the room
And I can't wait to get next to you
Whenever you speak
Whenever you move
Whenever you breath
Baby, let me touch you, please
Secretly I'm wanting you
And I'm hoping you want me too
I smell your scent across the room
And I can't wait to get next to you
Secretly I'm wanting you
And I'm hoping you want me too
I smell your scent across the room
And I can't wait to get next to you
You smell so good
I just wanna kiss you
I wanna play with you
I don't know how to tell you
