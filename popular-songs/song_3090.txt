I want more, I want more
I want more, I want more
Friday night and we're just talking
Stars are crashing in the sky
Burning just for you and I
We don't need to over think this
Nothing's gonna to bring us down
Show them what we're all about
All the way, one hundred one percent
Touchdown
We're gonna kill it, lead the pack
Gonna take this town
Let's go, what you wanna wait for?
Let's take everything we ask for
Come on and turn it up
Let's tell the world we want more, more, more
I want more
Let's go, take over the dance floor
You be mine and I will be yours
Come on and let it play
Let me hear you say more, more, more
I want more, I want more
Take my hand and pull me closer
Whisper nothings in my ear
'Til the walls just disappear
Feel the music take you higher
Feel my heart beat like a drum
Baby, you're the only one
All the way, one hundred one percent
Touchdown
We're gonna kill it, lead the pack
Gonna take this town
Let's go, what you wanna wait for?
Let's take everything we ask for
Come on and turn it up
Let's tell the world we want more, more, more
I want more
Let's go, take over the dance floor
You be mine and I will be yours
Come on and let it play
Let me hear you say more, more, more
I want more
Come on, everybody, let's go party
'Til they kick us out now, I don't care
I want more
Once get it started
We won't stop until we get it all out
Take me there, take me there
More, more, more, I want more
Let's go, what you wanna wait for?
Let's take everything we ask for
Come on and turn it up
Let's tell the world we want more, more, more
I want more
Let's go, take over the dance floor
You be mine and I will be yours
Come on and let it play
Let me hear you say more, more, more
I want more, I want more
