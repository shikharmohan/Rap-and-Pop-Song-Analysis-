People love to talk an' Lord I've heard it all
A rumor's not a stranger in this town
Now me, I pay no mind
But it's hittin' home this time
Now I've been told you've gone
And let me down
I need to hear it straight from you
Is it rumor or truth
It would break my heart in two
But if it's gonna be bad news
I need to hear it straight from you
I need to hear it straight from you
They all know her name
You didn't spare me any shame
I wonder did you even try to hide
I think that you owe me just a little honesty
And even though you told me
With your eyes
I need to hear it straight from you
Is it rumor or truth
It would break my heart in two
But if it's gonna be bad news
I need to hear it straight from you
I need to hear it straight from you
