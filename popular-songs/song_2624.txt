I was writing
Thinking with my long hand
Put pen to paper
Everything was sinking
Then you start to wonder
How you gonna handle me?
When I'm under
Swimming in the dark sea
Everybody wants you to make it
Its all yours
Everybody wants to take it
Its all yours
Everybody wants you to make it
Its all yours
Everybody wants to T-t-t-take it
Can you feel all the love
Can you feel all the love?
Can you feel all the love
Can you feel all the love?
Like it was made for you
Like it was made for you...
Tell me something
Something that can move me
Dont tell me lies
Or I swear you're gonna lose me
Guilty? like an ocean
Jealous of the fish it feeds
Your devotion
Swimming inside of me
Everybody wants you to make
Its all yours
Everybody wants to take
Its all yours
Everybody wants you to make
Its all yours
Everybody wants to T-t-t-take it
[Can you feel all the love
Can you feel all the love?
Can you feel all the love
Can you feel all the love?]
Like it was made for you
Like it was made for you...
Can you feel
Can you feel?
Can you feeeel?
All the right friends in all the right places
All the right moves and all the right faces
All the right friends in all the right places
All the right moves and all the right faces
[Can you feel all the love]
All the right friends in all the right places
All the right moves and all the right faces
[Can you feel all the love]
All the right friends in all the right places
All the right moves and all the right faces
