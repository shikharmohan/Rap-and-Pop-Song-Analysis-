She can't put her finger on a single lipstick stain
Perfume doesn't linger in his shirt
There's no matchbook in his pocket with a number and a name
So why does she still hurt?
'Cause a woman knows when there's another woman
She can feel her all over her man
A woman knows when there's another woman
You can't fool her, don't try to think you can
What she don't know won't hurt her, that's what he tells himself
So he hides his cheatin' heart inside his chest
He thinks he's put one over but what he doesn't know
'Cause he's already confessed
'Cause a woman knows when there's another woman
She can feel her all over her man
A woman knows when there's another woman
You can't fool her, don't try to think you can
A woman knows when there's another woman
You can't fool her, don't try to think you can
You can't fool her, don't try to think you can
