You want me to jam I'm finna enter
Brain waves came from insane days
Make ya sick like bad mayonnaise
(Tech N9ne)
Got the remedy rhyme
Infinity
Criminally tryin to be some shit
I crack you open like the youngest male Kennedy
Got the whole planet rockin off the low blows
Damnit I show flows and poke hoes that's supposed to be yours
Seekin my haters and in a dark alley tourmented by mine
Dodgin the (Tech 4x N9ne 4x)
Now here's a message
Liberace may Chocolatate'
take 'em I'ma rock na
Playa, do the fuck what I say
Throw ya souls in the air like this
Flash ya bar codes while I stick em
with another hit up out of the abyss
The Tech N9ne Nina out to find vaginas
Just the playa clubbin it, rubbin it
Lovin that crema streama, might seem a li'l extreme
My thing when I flips I got to make sho that it's hot
Gotta make the whole planet rock like this
[Chorus]
Here's my chance to blast away (Tech Tech N9ne N9ne *echoed*)
Haters causing friction
Party people, party people, can y'all get funky

Party people, party people, can y'all get funky

Call it what ya want it
Ghetto futuristic come get up on it
There's a bianc up in my sector can I bone it
Cause all we wanna do is
Get drunk, get blowed, spit shits, spark blunts and fuck hoes
We quick to beat a buster down bad
MidWest side put me in the sound lab
Now I'm hot damn like a ?????
I flipped it backwards for you flow snatchers
Blast ya'll
When you ask Nina to playin fast ball
Crash all
Glad y'all
Mad y'all
Cause last call was in the back of the club
Bangin da hell outta dis bad bra
On my planet we take no haters for granted
They Kris Kross
(10 seconds til lift off)
Be somethin pistol grips off
Ripped off
The techniques complete heat
Retreat 69 to 6 feet
Unique speeks freak tweeks
Never let the BCs can it
While the trooper Tecca Nina rock the planet
[Chorus]
Party people, party people, can y'all get funky

[Don Juan]
I'm about the strippers in the back makin' ass hop
A Mitchell Bade tryna grip 'em like a pad lock
The Don Juan really never let the cash stop
The Tecca Nina make the planet rock
It don't stop
[Tech N9ne]
I got dat type of flow to make 'em make Scream 3
Six rappers being hunted by a killa MC
I neva killed a bianca with a 36D
A party with the bitches on my planet lookin crispy
Swiftly makin rappers do 360
(Never knew three sixes)
Other niggaz tryna diss me be
(Under these prefixes)
Non ill mouth
Functional (N9ne)
Rambuctional
Never let up off a heated mic till I'm comfortable
Rogue style
57, 56 street gang
Grips we gain
Anybody wanna trips we bang
Hit us with a what
Lyrical head splitter
Making hella hoes
Get a nut
Make 'em put the rolls
In their butt
Let a hoe be a slut
Negro never give a fuck
Nina Ross
Why the attitude
You got the sauce
Nigga I'm mad cause the Chiefs lost
I'm pissed off
In Kansas City
I'm straight from the abyss
Tech N9ne
I got the whole planet rocking with me
Whole planet
Rocking like this
[Chorus]
Here's my chance to blast away (Tech Tech N9ne N9ne *echoed*)
Haters causing friction
Party people, party people, can y'all get funky

Party people, party people, can y'all get funky
