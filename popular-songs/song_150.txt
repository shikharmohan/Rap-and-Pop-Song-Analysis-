While we're young and beautiful
Kiss me like you mean it
Treat me like I'm special
Cover me with sweetness
'Cause a time will come
When I'm not so young and beautiful
While we're young and beautiful
Living free and easy
Here without a worry
Dancing in our bare feet
'Cause when the summer's done
When I not be so young and beautiful
It's a crazy ride
And baby, you and I
Are keeping our sweet love alive
Tonight, while we're young and beautiful
While we're young and beautiful
We'll party down on Main street
Wearing next to nothing
Feeling every heart beat
Having fun, while we're still young and beautiful
Oh, it's a crazy ride
And baby, you and I
Are keeping our sweet love alive
Tonight, while we're young and beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful, young and beautiful
Oh beautiful, beautiful, young and beautiful
Oh, it's a crazy ride
And baby, you and I
Are keeping our sweet love alive
Tonight, while we're young and beautiful
Oh, so beautiful
While we're young and beautiful
Cover me with sweetness
While we're young and beautiful
Kiss me like you mean it
Like you mean it, like you mean it
Like you mean it, like you do
Oh, yeah, oh so beautiful
