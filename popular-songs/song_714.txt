Dance with me
Oh you just walk in
Dance
(Haha)
Too much is
On your mind
Gotta let it go
Can't worry all the time
Just let it flow
You say you need a break
There's nothin'
I can do
Sittin' here
Listening to you
Baby, what's this you tell me
Things ain't been goin' your way
Just take it from me
It's gonna be alright
So let's go out tonight
And we can leave
All our cares behind
Dance the night away
  (Dance)
Party 'til the sun comes up
  (Or)
Go grab a friend
Get on the floor
Come on and dance
(Dance)
Dance

Dance with me
DJ if you please
Nobody's on the wall
That's what I like
Come closer to me now
And hold me tight
Tell me just how
You're feeling right now
Are you really
Havin' a good time?
Baby, what's this you tell me
Thing's ain't been goin' your way
Just take it from me
It's gonna be alright
So let's go out tonight
And we can leave
All our cares behind
Dance the night away
(All night)
Party 'til the sun comes up

Go grab a friend
Get on the floor
Come on and dance
