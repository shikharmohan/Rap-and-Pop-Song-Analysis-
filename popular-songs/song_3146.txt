[intro: Tech N9ne]
This song is very close and dear to my heart, man
To be able to say something like this
It takes a hella motherfucker to say it
This song is deticated to all my people
Its called "Message To The Black Man"
Check it out
[chorus]
My people you supposed to be
My poeple ain't cha
But my people ain't something that I see
Cuz they not never you at my shows
We've been all over the globe
Ya we been makin the doe
But cha all spending it
My people you supposed to be
My poeple ain't cha
But my people ain't something that I see
Cuz they not never you up on my records
If you at my shows
Y'all dont no I'm about to become boss and
Take control
[1st verse: Tech N9ne]
It started on the slave shift
If field niggas would eventually take the day shift
Would house niggas inside loyalty may shift
And identify us now we still need a race lift
Fuck a face lift I ain't changing my identity
For energy for any thats obsenity
Now in 2000 and 7 we sippin ain't no remidy
Jealousy indian murder like you in kinamy
Guess we ain't nigga we go hard in the paint nigga
Still when you see me out you ain't the one who faint nigga
Its the other fans from the other lands
They listen to me more then my sister and brother man
I could see if I was a wack mother fucker
Bitching about the way my people act mother fucker
But I do spit my people dont be so fuck'n reclusive
Get off of your lazy ass like you know something about music
[chorus]
My people you supposed to be
My poeple ain't cha
But my people ain't something that I see
Cuz they not never you at my shows
We've been all over the globe
Ya we been makin the doe
But cha all spending it
My people you supposed to be
My poeple ain't cha
But my people ain't something that I see
Cuz they not never you up on my records
If you at my shows
Y'all dont no I'm about to become boss and
Take control
[2nd verse: Tech N9ne]
You cry about the way I paint my face
It ain't your taste well homie let my state my case
Im not a devil or damn jester roomers can fester
Never uplift a demond with an image of my ancester
African act like you see me when you be traffican
Laughter when you frown up at me your hatrid is baffelin
You watch american idol my people might paint the tribalin
Symbolizes not evil but that were still survival
You niggas be so tuff the moment we roll up
Your upper lip rollled up you hatin me so wut
Everyone knows us my city is sold up
My shows crushed but cha dont show up
They say its more the money bitches whores
Its funny this is war my people at his door
And I'm knocking mean wile we rocking
Globally and its sad man
Look like attandents
Got my people lookin real bad man
[chorus]
My people you supposed to be
My poeple ain't cha
But my people ain't something that I see
Cuz they not never you at my shows
We've been all over the globe
Ya we been makin the doe
But cha all spending it
My people you supposed to be
My poeple ain't cha
But my people ain't something that I see
Cuz they not never you up on my records
If you at my shows
Y'all dont no I'm about to become boss and
Take control
[3rd verse: Tech N9ne]
I wouldnt be bitchin if I didnt want you around me
The way you write me up as a demon astounds me
Brother linch, 40 water, federation, dmx
Buster rhymes, quincy, and x clan found me
Brother jay homie he whipped me till this day homie
Who you know is blacker then that
With a staffer and lack
My people up in the tragidy and they rap
Im immaculate maybe they grab it
If I was blastin a mack
Attack and my people
Cuz I'm black and I'm leathel
With this rap but I'm trapped
But I'm crack
Why you be so close minded
When I'm rhyme it
Wishing you could find it
Everybody but you mother fuckers get behind it
And I'm doper then king nigga
Message to weed nigga
Rockin sold out shows is where I'm gonna nigga
And thats all I sell out its something you should see nigga
Betcha would come see nigga
If I told you it was free nigga
[chorus]
My people you supposed to be
My poeple ain't cha
But my people ain't something that I see
Cuz they not never you at my shows
We've been all over the globe
Ya we been makin the doe
But cha all spending it
My people you supposed to be
My poeple ain't cha
But my people ain't something that I see
Cuz they not never you up on my records
If you at my shows
Y'all dont no I'm about to become boss and
Take control
[outro]
Act like you know I'm your very own, motherfuckers
Ardcore shit, stop buying all that bootleg bullshit, too
Support your mutherfucking artist
And big scoob said, when he finds out who's fuckin'
Bootlegin the summer edition, Rogue Dog shit
Hes at that motherfucking ass
And I'm right behind his motherfucking ass, you dig me?
Tech N9ne, Nigga!
