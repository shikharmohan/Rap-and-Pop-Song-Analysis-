Girl, don't you know it's all I can do
To keep my hands off of you
Anytime you're around
An' when the stars come out at night
I dream of holdin' you tight
Every time I lay down
It feels so good to me to have you this bad
The only other thing I wish I had was
A chance, a chance
To tell you how I feel about you
How it feels to live without a chance
A chance
To tell you I'll love you forever
Knowin' that I'll never have a chance
Sometimes reality hurts
And you wonder if life's worth
Livin' at all
Knowin' no matter how much you care
You'll never have a prayer
Of havin' what you want
At least I've been close enough I could taste
Beauty at it's best but never a trace of
A chance, a chance
To tell you, how I feel about you
How it feels to live without a chance
A chance
To tell you, I'll love you forever
Knowin' that I'll never have a chance
A chance, a chance
To tell you, I'll love you forever
Knowin' that I'll never have the chance
