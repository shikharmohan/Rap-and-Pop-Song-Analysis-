Shake it down easy
Shake it down sleazy, come on
Shake it down easy
Shake yourself, Suzy, come on
Don't let me detain you, try to ride along
Don't you lie, knowing
I am not sad, I am not silly
I am not chippin', I am not chippin' away
Talk to me
In your own language, please
In your own, talk to me
In your own language please
Shake it down easy
Make it sound seamy, doll man
Make it sound now
Make it full house, sad man
Leader of the band makes a mental hell
I won't weather it well
Well, I never saw it with my arm
Paint it with my heart
Paint it with my eyes and make it right
Lay down easy
Lay it down seamy, sad man
Lay down easy
Lay it down seamy, sad man
You don't want to hear this, nothin' but a whore
I will play the leader with pain
Now you know I'm needy
Lay them down easy, lay them down easy
Talk to me
In your own language please
