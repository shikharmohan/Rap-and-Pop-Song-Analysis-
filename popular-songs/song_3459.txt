Hey
I'm gonna ride that iron horse into the sun
I'm gonna say goodbye to you
And all the things you've done
I used to be afraid but I know today is the day
I'll take the last train I can find
Just in case I wanna change my mind
The last one out is number nine
But here I am just buyin' time again
Waitin' on train number ten
One more drag of one more cigarette
I've made up my mind but I ain't ready yet
'Cause if that devil hits those tracks
I know that I can't come back
Take the last train I can find
And just in case I wanna change my mind
The last one out is number nine
But here I am hummin' misery and gin
Waitin' on train number ten
It's gettin' late, maybe tonight
She won't show up and change my mind
Take the last train I can find
Just in case I wanna change my mind
The last one out is number nine
But here I am just spitin' in the wind
Waitin' on train number ten, train number ten
