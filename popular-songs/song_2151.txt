I will never bother you 
I will never promise to
I will never follow you 
I will never bother you 
Never speak a word again 
I will crawl away for good
I will move away from here 
You won't be afraid of fear 
No thought was put into this
I always knew it would come to this 
Things have never been so swell 
And I have never failed to fail
Pain! (x3)
You know you're right (x3)
It's so warm and calm inside 
I no longer have to hide 
There's talk about someone else 
Steaming, soon begins to melt
Nothin' really bothers her 
She just wants to love herself 
I will move away from here 
You won't be afraid of fear 
No thought was put into this 
I always knew it'd come to this 
Things have never been so swell 
And I have never failed to fail 
Pain! (x5)
You know you're right (x12)
You know your rights (x4)
Pain ...
