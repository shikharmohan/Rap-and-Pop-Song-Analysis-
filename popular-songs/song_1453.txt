She hit the door 6:55
Sack full of groceries split down the side
Canned goods scattered all the way to the curb
Look on her face saying don't say a word
So, it's me and her and a can of beans
Sitting there on the front porch swing
Western sky all turning red
Head on my shoulder she sighed and said
"Been gopherin', chaufferin' company chairmen
Coffee maker, copy repairman
Anymore there ain't nothin I swear man, that I don't do
Been jugglin', strugglin', closing big deals
Dancing backwards in high heels
Just when it feels like I can't make it through"
She said,"It sure is nice to just be the woman with you"
She said, "The girl I was with the business degree
Probally wouldn't recognize me
I was gonna run the bank, I was gonna run them out
Now all I wanna run is a bubble bath
Back then you know I had this plan
Before all of this reality set in
Here comes life boy ready or not
Hey I wanted it all and thats what I got"
"B'cause I'm gopherin', chaufferin' company chairmen
Coffee maker, copy repairman
Anymore there ain't nothin I swear man that I don't do
Been jugglin', strugglin', closing big deals
Dancing backwards in high heels
Just when it feels like I can't make it through"
