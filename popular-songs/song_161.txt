Lately, nothing I do, ever seems to please you
And maybe, turning my back would be that much easier
'Cause hurtful words are all that we exchange
But I can't watch you walk away
Can I forget about the way it feels to touch you?
And all about the good times that we've been through
Could I wake up without you every day?
And would I let you walk away?
No, I can't learn to live without
And I can't give up on us now
Oh, I know I could say we're through and tell myself I'm over you
But even if I made a vow, I promise not to miss you now
And try to hide the truth inside, I fell 'cause I, I just can't live a lie
Could I forget the look that tells me that you want me?
And all the reasons that make loving you so easy
The kiss that always makes it hard to breathe
The way, you know, just what I mean
No, I can't learn to live without
Oh, so don't you give up on us now
Oh, I know I could say we're through and tell myself I'm over you
But even if I made a vow, I promise not to miss you now
And try to hide the truth inside, I fell 'cause I, I just can't live a lie
Oh, and I don't wanna try
Oh, I know I could say we're through and tell myself I'm over you
But even if I made a vow, I promise not to miss you now
And try to hide the truth inside, I fell 'cause I, I just can't live a lie
I just can't live a lie
But even if I made a vow, I promise not to miss you now
And try to hide the truth inside, I fell 'cause I, I just can't live a lie
Oh, I can't live a lie, oh, I can't live a lie
