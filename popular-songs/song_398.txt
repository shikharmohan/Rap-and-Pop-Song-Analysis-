Up in the window light tonight
Where I can see your silhouette
I've been throwin' little stones
But I don't believe you've even heard me yet
Today you crossed your heart
And said you'd meet me in the dark
When I called you on the phone
You pretended you weren't home
Hey baby, what do you say
Won't you come on outside tonight
The moon is finally shinin' bright as day
Hey what do you say
Can't you hear the music in the wind
And see our shadows on the ground
Aw won't you come on down
We're gonna do a little fiddlin' around
Can't ya hear the banjo's ringin' through the air
There'll be mandolins and guitars everywhere
Now don't you wanna be there
Hey baby, what do you say
Won't you come on outside tonight
The moon is finally shinin' bright as day
Hey what do you say
Can't you hear the music in the wind
And see our shadows on the ground
Aw won't you come on down
We're gonna do a little fiddlin' around
If you'd look outside, you'd see the lights
Of my old corvette
Are you tryin' to drive me crazy babe
Or did you just forget
Hey baby, what do you say
Won't you come on outside tonight
The moon is finally shinin' bright as day
Hey what do you say
Can't you hear the music in the wind
And see our shadows on the ground
Aw won't you come on down
We're gonna do a little fiddlin' around
