I'm not wasting my time on earthly longing
Let that glory leave me be
I'm just tasting my life story
Just a page in history
Whoever's watching
Must be watching, over me
Whoever's watching
Must be watching, over me
Well I'm not hurting like I used to
I got lucky, can't you see?
Love came searching, it could choose you
Love's the greatest victory
Whoever's watching
Must be watching, over me
Whoever's watching
Must be watching, over me
I always look to the sky and held my head high
Had to be what I had to be
Till the day that I die
Yes, I wonder why
Somebody's watching
Watching over me, yeah
Whoever's watching
Must be watching, over me
Well if you know me, you know I've squandered
Everything that's dear to me
Still I stand here in total wonder
How it's all come back to me
Whoever's watching
Must be watching, over me
Whoever's watching
Must be watching, over me
Whoever's watching
Must be watching, over me
