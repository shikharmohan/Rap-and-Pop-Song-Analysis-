Oh my mother was frightened by a shotgun they say 
That's why I'm such a wonderful shot 
I'd be out in the cactus and I'd practice all day 
And now tell me, what have I got
I'm quick on the trigger 
With targets not much bigger than a pinpoint 
I'm number one 
But my score with a feller 
Is lower than a cellar 
No you can't get a man with a gun
When I'm with a pistol 
I sparkle like a crystal 
Yes I shine like the morning sun 
But I lose all my luster when with a crumple buster 
Oh, you can't get a man with a gun
With a gun! With a gun! 
No you can't get a man with a gun 
If I went to battle with someone's herd of cattle 
You'd have steak when the job was done 
But if I shot the herder 
They'd holler bloody murder! 
And you can't get a hug from a mug with a slug 
Oh, you can't get a man with a gun
I'm cool, brave and darin' 
To see a line a-blarin' when I'm out with my rimming tongue 
But a look from a mister 
Will raise a fever blister 
Oh, you can't get a man with a gun
The gals with umbrellers 
Are always out with fellers 
In the rain or the blazing sun 
But a man never traffles with gals who carry rifles 
Oh, you can't get a man with a gun
With a gun! With a gun! 
No you can't get a man with a gun 
A Tom, Dick, or Harry 
Will build a house for Carrie when the preacher has made 'em one
But he can't build ya houses with buckshot in his trousers
And you can't shoot a man in the tail like a quaile 
Oh, you can't get a man with a gun
A man's love is mighty 
He'll even buy a nighty for a gal who he thinks is fun
But they don't by pajamas for pistol-packin' mamas! 
Oh, a man may be hot, but he's not 
When he's shot! 
Oh you can't get a man with a gun!
