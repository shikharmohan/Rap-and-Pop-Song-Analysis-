Blue, I'm gettin' kind of close to you
Like a shadow I can't lose
Hey, you've been hanging with me everyday
Now you're gettin' in my way
I know you understand me
But don't you think maybe it's time to move on
What's up lonely?
Seems you're my only friend who wants to share my pain
Tell me heartache, what's it gonna take
For you to leave me alone today
Just when I think that you're gone
You're in the mirror looking back at me
So what's up lonely?
Lonely, ooh
Sometimes, I wish you weren't by my side
Can't you find another shoulder
'Cause I, I wanna leave this broken heart behind
We're both wasting too much time
Find someone else to rain on
I'm really gettin' tired of singing this sad song
What's up lonely?
Seems you're my only friend who wants to share my pain
Tell me heartache, what's it gonna take
For you to leave me alone today
Just when I think that you're gone
You're in the mirror looking back at me
So what's up lonely?
Don't wanna give you a reason
To hang around anymore
You won't be hurting my feelings
If you find another broken heart
You can lean on
Gotta go, gotta move on
Gotta go, gotta move on
Just leave me alone
What's up lonely?
(What's up lonely?)
Seems you're my only
  (Hey)
Friend who wants to share my pain
Tell me heartache
(Tell me heartache)
What's it gonna take?
For you to leave me alone today
Just when I think that you're gone
You're in the mirror looking back at me
  (So what's up lonely?)
So what's up lonely?
Gotta go, gotta move on
Gotta go, gotta move on
Yeah yeah, hey
What's up lonely?
Seems you're my only, baby, yeah
  (Friend who wants to share my pain)
Tell me what's it gonna take
  (Tell me heartache)
Just leave me alone
  (What's it gonna take?)
Yeah, yeah, what's up lonely?
