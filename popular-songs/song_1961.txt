I can't get it back, but I don't want it back
I've realized that she don't know how to act
Never been a dumb dude, no I'm not dense
I just had a slight lack of common sense
I was the good guy, she was the bad girl
I'm thinking one girl, she thinking me, Earl, James and Jimmy
Yep she had plenty
But love for me, she didn't have any
I was inviting her into my heart
But she was out riding in some other man's car
She was my night time, thought I was her star
Guess I was wrong but see I'm strong
Won't take long for me to move on
Please don't worry 'bout me I'm fine
Only gonna play the fool one time
Trust me when I say that I'll be okay
Go on girl, go on girl, go on girl
I can't get it back, but I don't want it back
I've realized that she don't know how to act
Tried to settle down and look what I get
Thought it was my time but I guess not yet
She at the bar getting drinks from many men
I'm in the house, thinking she's with her girlfriends
Just not knowing, truly not knowing
I look back now like, man, I was open
I was inviting her into my heart
But she was out riding in some other man's car
She was my night time, thought I was her star
Guess I was wrong, but see I'm strong
Won't take long for me to move on
Please don't worry 'bout me I'm fine
Only gonna play the fool one time
Trust me when I say that I'll be okay
Go on girl, go on girl, go on girl
The mistake I made is clear
We never should've been together
That's the reason you're not here
I know that I can do much better
Not a single salty tear
Not a feeling in my chest
Baby I'm feeling no stress
I'm too fly to be depressed
Go on girl, go on girl
Go on girl, go on girl
Please don't worry 'bout me I'm fine
Only gonna play the fool one time
Trust me when I say that I'll be okay
Go on girl, go on girl, go on girl
Please don't worry 'bout me I'm fine
Only gonna play the fool one time
Trust me when I say that I'll be okay
Go on girl, go on girl, go on girl
Go on girl, go on girl, go on girl
I'll be fine
