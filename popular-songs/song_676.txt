Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah oh
Said she gave you everything
She broke her back to be
What you need?
I tried so long to just compete
Can't take no more
Losin' sight of me
I'm lettin' you know this can't go on
This one way street
I'm walkin' alone
This time I'm breakin' free
I'm goin' to find me
I can't sit and be passive
Won't tolerate no more
That's it
I tried so hard to be
What you wanted me to be?
(Wanted me to be)
If it can't be fifty fifty
Then know that it don't fit me
I can't give you all that's in me
'Cause baby that's not me
Don't want you to think that I'm selfish
I'm just sick of your one track mess
If you can't meet me halfway
I think it's time that you be on your way
I love you but I can't baby, you
If it's your mama, you want
You know just what to do
I looked in the mirror everyday
I saw myself fadin' away
Your tryin' to mold be into her
I loved you so
I put you first
But I can't live my life this way
I can't sit and be passive
Won't tolerate no more
That's it
I tried so hard to be
What you wanted me to be?
   (Wanted me to be)
If it can't be fifty fifty
Then know that it don't fit me
I can't give you all that's in me
'Cause baby that's not me
I was so lost in love before
I couldn't see the light
But now I'm strong enough to leave you now
So you better treat me right
Don't wanna throw it all away
So baby
Here's your last chance, ohh
Don't wanna fight with you
But I need more of you
Give me all
Or it's the end
I can't sit and be passive
Won't tolerate no more
That's it
I tried so hard to be
  (I tried)
What you wanted me to be?
  (Wanted me to be)
If it can't be fifty fifty
  (No, no)
Then know that it don't fit me
  (No, no)
I can't give you all that's in me
'Cause baby that's not me
I cooked, I cleaned
I washed your clothes
  (Baby don't leave)
You were so mean, so ungrateful at night
   (So wonder you got)
I cried so many times
Tell me how could you go diss me?
  (How could this be?)
When you know one day you'll miss me
  (Know you'll miss me)
If it can't be fifty fifty
Then baby that's not me
I can't sit and be passive
  (Baby)
Won't tolerate no more
  (Baby)
That's it
  (Baby)
I tried so hard to be
What you wanted me to be?
(Wanted me to be)
If it can't be fifty fifty
Then know that it don't fit me
  (I can't, I won't)
I can't give you all that's in me
  (I can't, I won't)
'Cause baby that's not me
I can't sit and be passive
  (I can't, I won't)
Won't tolerate no more
  (I can't, I won't)
That's it
  (I can't, I won't)
I tried so hard to be
  (I can't, I won't)
What you wanted me to be?
(Wanted me to be)
  (I can't, I won't)
If it can't be fifty fifty
  (I can't, I won't)
Then know that it don't fit me
  (I can't, I won't)
I can't give you all that's in me
  (I can't, I won't)
'Cause baby that's not me
  (I can't, I won't)
I can't sit and be passive
Won't tolerate no more
That's it
I tried so hard to be
What you wanted me to be?
  (Wanted me to be)
If it can't be fifty fifty
Then know that it don't fit me
I can't give you all that's in me
'Cause baby that's not me
Na ho, ho, ho, ho
Na ho, ho, ho, ho
Na
