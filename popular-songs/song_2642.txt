Autumn wind turns again
The days are warm, start to fade
And all that's here is still the same
Memories fall like rain
The only world I know
Steady as you go
It's too easy, it's too easy for you
It's too easy, it's too easy for you
Sinking in the sand of time
A measurable bind, I'll be fine
I'll burn a fire above the air
So heaven is still on my side
Where is it tonight
No more alibis
It's too easy, it's too easy for you
It's too easy, it's too easy for you
Autumn wind turns again
The days are warm, start to fade
