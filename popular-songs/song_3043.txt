My nerves are shot, the coffee's cold
Wish that I could be so bold as to
Walk right up to you and say what I think
I don't now what you think of me
And I know everyone can see
I'm crazy about you and always will be
Where's women's lib when you need it the most
Or was it mama who said
You're not suppose to flaunt yourself like that
As if there's no in between
Or maybe it's not that I'm afraid
It's just that the last move I made
Embarrassed me to death
And made me want to hide
So if you've ever been embarrassed before
Meet me half way so I'll know for sure
At least we'll still be friends if I mess up again
'Cause it ain't easy meeting someone new
Especially when that someone is you
It ain't easy being by yourself, it's no fun to be alone
And I don't want to be alone
'Cause it ain't easy meeting someone new
Especially when that someone is you
It ain't easy by being by yourself, it's no fun to be alone
Oh, no and I don't want to be alone
My nerves are shot, the coffee's cold
Wish that I could be so bold as to
Walk right up to you and say what I think
