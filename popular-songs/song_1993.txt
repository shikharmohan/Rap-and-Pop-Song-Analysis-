Something wrong with my head
I just don't feel good today
This room is spinning round and round
My visions blurry
Can't see my hand in front of my face
Girl I think I better sit down
I know what's going on
I know what's in to me
And I know what'll make it alright
Boy your kiss that's all i need
Just one to help me get through the night
Don't know where you are in the world
But drop what you're doing and get to your girl
I got a sickness boy only your love can heal
Baby come and fix me up
My medicine you and only you for real
Baby come and fix me up
fix me up (fix me up)
fix me up (fix me up)
fix me up (fix me up)
fix me up (fix me up)
Girl
My medicine you and only you for real
Baby come and fix me up
Oh
Lay hands on me (on me)
Boy if i could I'd put you in a pill
Twice a day much more would kill
So what let me O.D.
If i die from too much ecstasy least I'd go happy
I see the light at the end of the tunnel
I'm fading fast I need my special one so
I can recover (cover)
I need my lover (lover)
Give me a kiss and then give me another
Don't know where you are in the world but
Stop what youÃÂ¢€re doing and get to your girl
I got a sickness boy only your love can heal
Baby come and fix me up
My medicine you and only you for real
Baby come and fix me up
fix me up (fix me up)
fix me up (fix me up)
fix me up (fix me up)
fix me up (fix me up)
Girl
My medicine you and only you for real
Baby come and fix me up
Oh

your touching (heal me)
you kiss babe (heal me)
your love baby (heal me)
your love baby (heal me)
your love baby (heal me)
Only thing I want and need
You right here with me
I got a sickness boy only your love can heal
Baby come and fix me up
My medicine you and only you for real
Baby come and fix me up
fix me up (fix me up)
fix me up (fix me up)
