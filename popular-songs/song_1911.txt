She's so fly
She's so fly
She hit the floor and make the club ignite
She's like a sexy little fire
She keep on begging for more if you play it right
She'll fulfill your every desire
So super natural, for real
A crazy style and sex appeal
Hey pretty mama what's the deal, would you be mine?
Hey, girl you got what I like
Can't nobody strut like her, can't nobody touch her
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Can't nobody cut like her, can't nobody touch her
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
She got the music pumping through her veins
The way she move, it makes you wanna
Get up and touch that body
I like to sit and watch her do her thang
But in a minute I'ma join her
So super natural, for real
A crazy style and sex appeal
Hey pretty mama what's the deal, would you be mine?
Hey, girl you got what I like
Can't nobody strut like her, can't nobody touch her
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Can't nobody cut like her, can't nobody touch her
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody strut like her, can't nobody touch her
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Can't nobody cut like her, can't nobody touch her
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
So super natural, for real
A crazy style and sex appeal
Hey pretty mama what's the deal, would you be mine?
Hey, hey, girl you got what I like
Can't nobody touch her
Can't nobody cut like her
Can't nobody touch her
Can't nobody strut like her, can't nobody touch her
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Can't nobody cut like her, can't nobody touch her
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
