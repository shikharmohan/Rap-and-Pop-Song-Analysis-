im staring at the pillow where you slept last night
it was almost like you were laying there
and the shirt that you wore of mine
took it off and threw it across the chair
now its kinda hard to get you off my mind
when i keep seeing you everywhere
for example like that lipstick on that glass of wine, damn
sitting right over there
and i cant play it off like we're friends like i used to
no, i cant pretend like i used to
so now im laying in my bed thinking  bout you
and what do i do
girl, im feeling like im coming down with the case of you
now, it started in my head but it trickled down to my shoes
i feel so weak, so hard to breath
but it only seems to happen when you leave, girl
ain't nobody ever had me feeling quite like you do
im coming down with the case of you
trying not to think about you only got me missing you more
and loneliness ain't no cure
though it was over about now
but no, not yet
pulled the covers up to my head
now im feeling dizzy, and my mouth is dry
with just the thought of you on my mind
its kinda crazy, what a mess im in
i cant believe this is happening
and i cant play it off like we're friends like i used to
no, i cant pretend like i used to
so now im laying in my bed thinking  bout you
girl, im feeling like im coming down with the case of you
now, it started in my head but it trickled down to my shoes
i feel so weak, so hard to breath
but it only seems to happen when you leave, girl
ain't nobody ever had me feeling quite like you do
im coming down with the case of you
now this aint no common cold
what i feel is original
and i know there is a remedy
when you bring your body back to me
girl, im feeling like im coming down with the case of you
now, it started in my head but it trickled down to my shoes
i feel so weak, so hard to breath
but it only seems to happen when you leave, girl
ain't nobody ever had me feeling quite like you do
im coming down with the case of you
girl, im feeling like im coming down with the case of you
now, it started in my head but it trickled down to my shoes
i feel so weak, so hard to breath
but it only seems to happen when you leave, girl
ain't nobody ever had me feeling quite like you do
im coming down with the case of you
