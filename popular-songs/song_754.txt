Even if you don't like me
I bet you fall in love with my ride, my ride, my ride
Got girls wanna be wifey
'Cause they fell in love with my ride, my ride, my ride
Okay, I pull up to the club on them Scottie Pippen's
You say you got dubz, well I'm thirteen mo' inches
These chromed out wheels got y'all haters out there squintin'
When I hop in that club line I ain't lookin' for no friendships
Got Clyntell pipes, custom tint up on my windows
My air vents sealed so I never lose no endo
Who's trailing me, my kin-folk? We weavin' through the streets
And the flow's like the wind, how it be breezin' through these beats
And my seats got my name on it, yeah I know you ain't on this
Sparkle custom paint on this, on that droptop frame on this
The grill is exclusive and the ride's all inclusive
The only one that's whippin' is this singer slash producer
Say you wanna get drunk, I gotta bar up in my car
I never get bored with foreign broads up in my car
So when it's nasty time I'm goin' hard up in my car
Touch down, hundred yards up in my car
Even if you don't like me
I bet you fall in love with my ride, my ride, my ride
Got girls wanna be wifey
'Cause they fell in love with my ride, my ride, my ride
Is it the chrome up on my wheels or that base up in my trunk?
Chrome, chrome up on my wheels or that base up in my trunk
Is it the chrome up on my wheels or that base up in my trunk?
Base, base up in my trunk, base, base up in my trunk
Now when I'm cruisin' in my whip, damn right I crank my CD
Got three groupies on deck and they all beggin' to see these
They saw the navigation system and all of my TV's
Said they boyfriends whip was better, hell now you must be Stevie
You see me, these stunner shades got me seein' 3D
Dope boys know I'm pushin' more crack then Petey
Though my gas tank on EZ I'm buyin' up Moeezy
Please believe me you chillin' with a star
Hop in my car, I hit the after party
What goes down between us, girl I won't tell nobody
Either in my Lac or in my Maserati
Just wait till I pull into the lobby
So even if you don't like me
I bet you fall in love with my ride, my ride, my ride
Got girls wanna be wifey
'Cause they fell in love with my ride, my ride, my ride
Is it the chrome up on my wheels or that base up in my trunk?
Chrome, chrome up on my wheels or that base up in my trunk
Is it the chrome up on my wheels or that base up in my trunk?
Base, base up in my trunk, base, base up in my trunk
So if you wanna ride then baby we can go down town
Girl, with that pretty face I might just let my windows down
So all my homies can see just who I get to ride with
And if you ever lonely then sweet baby girl hit my sidekick
'Cause even if you don't like me
I bet you fall in love with my ride, my ride, my ride
Got girls wanna be wifey
'Cause they fell in love with my ride, my ride, my ride
Is it the chrome up on my wheels or that base up in my trunk?
Chrome, chrome up on my wheels or that base up in my trunk
Is it the chrome up on my wheels or that base up in my trunk?
Base, base up in my trunk, base, base up in my trunk
