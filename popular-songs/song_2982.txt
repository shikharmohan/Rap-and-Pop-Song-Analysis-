I sent you roses, I warned you I would
Do all that I could to show you the way that I feel
Please, don't say, I'm wasting my time
I've got nothin' but time so I'll do all that I can to catch
That ghost of a chance
The sunlight, the moonlight are beyond my control
And there are stars in the Heavens that I'll never hold
But if dreams give you power then I'm strong enough to offer my heart
And never give up till you love me, till you love me
I looked in your eyes, so bright and so blue
And that's when I knew, that you could be mine
If good things come to those who will wait
Well, I guess I can wait if that's what I have to do
Oh, it's worth it for you
The sunlight, the moonlight are beyond my control
And there are stars in the Heavens that I'll never hold
But if dreams give you power, oh then I'm strong enough to offer my heart
And never give up till you love me, till you love me
Oh the sunlight and the moonlight are beyond my control
And there are stars in the Heavens, oh that I'll never hold
But if dreams give you power, oh then I'm strong enough to offer my heart
Oh and never give up till you love me, till you love me, till you love me
