[Verse 1:]
I
See you across the room
I had to come get at you
You want it
Model Chick
Ooo you done true so I
Stepped to the DJ quick
I told him to drop that I'm Mr Biggs
Just give me the chance
To put my hands
On you
[Normal Chorus:]
Made the DJ slow it down
So I can put my arms around you
Had to get you next to me
Cause we about to be
Doing our thing
Slow dancing
Bumping and grinding and baby (baby)
Romancing
So into you
Not, trancin'
Hands on your waist
We face to face
Slowww dancing
Bumping and grinding and maybe
Romancing
I'm all in your ear
And I'm whispering (oh!)
I'm feeling lad
Cause we chillin baby (yeah)
[Verse 2:]
Now that I got you right here
I'm feeling you girl it's clear
You know what I mean
I'm thinking bout what's in them jeans
I aint tryna let you go
Don't want it to end oh no
Fienin for you for sure
So tell him to drop one more
[ Normal Chorus:]
Made the DJ slow it down
So I can put my arms around you
Had to get you next to me
Cause we about to be
Doing our thing
Slow dancing
Bumping and grinding and baby
Romancing
So into you
I'm trancin'
Hands on your waist

Slowww dancing
Bumping and grinding and baby
