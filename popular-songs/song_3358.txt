Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
And I cant keep picturing you with him
And it hurts so bad
Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
I replay it over and over again
And I can't take it, I can't shake it no
I can't wait to see you
Wanna see if you still got that look in your eye
That one you had for me before we said our goodbyes
And it's a shame that we gotta spend our time being mad about the same things (over and over again) about the same things (over and over again)
Oohhh but I think she's leaving
Oohhh man she's leaving
I don't know what else to do
Tim: Can't go on not loving you
Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
And I can't keep picturing you with him
And it hurts so bad
Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
I replay it over and over again
(yea) And I can't take it, (yea) I can't shake it no
I remember the day you left
I remember the last breath you took right in front of me
When you said that you would leave
I was too damn stubborn to try to stop you or say anything
But I see clearly now
And this choice I made keeps playing in my head (over and over again) play in my head (over and over again)
Oohhh but I think she's leaving
Oohhh man she's leaving
I don't know what else to do
Tim: I can't go on not loving you
Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
And I can't keep picturing you with him
And it hurts so bad
Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
I replay it over and over again
And I can't take it, I can't shake it no more
Now that I realize that I'm goin' down from all this pain you've put me through
Tim: Every time I close my eyes, I lock it down, oohhh, I can't go on not loving you
Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
And I can't keep picturing you with him
And it hurts so bad
Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
I replay it over and over again
And I can't take it, I can't shake it
Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
And I can't keep picturing you with him
And it hurts so bad
Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
I replay it over and over again
And I can't take it, I can't shake it no more
Over and over again
Over and over again
Cause it's all in my head
