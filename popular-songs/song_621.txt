I was down for the count
Feeling like Ive come to the end
Nothing really mattered
Nothing left for me to meant
(Ohhh)
And then u came and I still couldnt see
Till u thought down every walk at me
How u heal me with ure patience
If its all I ever do
Ill never stop loving u
Cause Im alive
I can breath
I can feel
I believe
And there aint no doubt about it
There aint no doubt about it
Im in love
And its all because of u
I was fainting but u pulled me through
Cause Im away
I survive
I was hurt
Thought I died
And there aint no doubt about it
As long as I have found it
Feel the beat again
Stronger than before
I wanna give u my heart
Until it beats no more
Was in a place for the pain
With a broken down heart
In despair
He took away my feeling
And made it hard for me to care
(Ohhh)
But then u crushed through the door to my soul
Put back all the pieces and made me hope
I was living in the past
(Oh no)
Now Im never looking back
Im never looking back
Cause Im alive
I can breath
I can feel
I believe
And there aint no doubt about it
There aint no doubt about it
Im in love
And its all because of u
I was fainting but u pulled me through
Cause Im away
I survive
I was hurt
Thought I died
And there aint no doubt about it
As long as I have found it
Feel the beat again
Stronger than before
I wanna give u my heart
Until it beats no more
Forever u want me too
I could see it through
All that I ever do
Never stop loving u
Cause Im alive
I can breath
I can feel
I believe
(Hey yeah)
And there aint no doubt about it
There aint no doubt about it
Im in love
And its all because of u
I was fainting but u pulled me through
(Fainting but u pulled me through)
Cause Im away
I survive
I was hurt
Thought I died
(Hey yeah)
And there aint no doubt about it
As long as I have found it
Feel the beat again
(Im much stronger, so much stronger than before)
Im gonna give u my heart
Until it beats no more
