Prayed for an angel
To come in the night
And shine some sweet light on me
Found only strangers
Then you came to me
Just when I'd given up
You gave me love
My world was tumblin' down
You turned it around, baby
You you, you're some kind of miracle, ohh baby
You are
You're a miracle to me
(To me, to me)
Sweet revelation
That look in your eyes
Your touch in the night
I find the sweetest salvation
In your arms, baby
Warm as the mornin' sun
Your tender love
(Your tender love)
Came and just lifted me up
Look what you've done baby
You you, you're some kind of miracle, ohh
You, you, you are
You're a miracle to me
Ohh
You've brought joy to my heart
I've found love in your arms
See what you've done to me
You set my soul so free
You came and you gave me the love that I need
Oh you, you're some kind of miracle, baby, yeah
You are
You're a miracle, a miracle to me
Baby, you are
Oh, a miracle to me
