Haa
Ohh oh
Woo
I've been so
Caught up in the thought of me and you
Even though I love
Someone else I know my heart belongs to you
Tell me how did we
Ever let the situation get this far
Maybe we should just
Try to hide the things we feel inside
Things I know we can't deny
Should've never told you
(Told you)
That I cared about you
(About you)
Didn't think that it would be so bad
Should've never kissed you
(Kissed you)
Should've never held your hand
Got to find a way to let these feelings go
What did I
Do the day I let you slip into my soul
  (Through my soul)
(My soul)
It was then, when I
Realized that I would always want you in my life
(In my life)
No one else can know
Of the things that we've been sayin' on the telephone
It would be so bad
If they ever knew that me and you
Were secretly into each other
Should've never told you
(Told you)
That I cared about you
(About you)
Didn't think that it would be so bad
Should've never kissed you
(Kissed you)
Should've never held your hand
Got to find a way to let these feelings go
Oh! I'm so scared, trembling inside
'Cause I'm feelin' like somebody else already knows
Oh my God, I love you both so much
But to have to choose between the two
Is hurting me so deep inside
Should've never told you
(Told you)
That I cared about you
(About you)
Didn't think they did would be, so bad
Should've never kissed you
(Kissed you)
Should've never held your hand
I don't ever wanna feel this way again
Should've never told you
(Told you)
  (Haa)
That I cared about you
 (Should've never)
(About you)
  (Haa)
(Huu haa)
Should've never kissed you
(Kissed you)
  (I've never ever looked away)
Should've never held your hand
  (From your face)
Should've never told you
(Told you)
