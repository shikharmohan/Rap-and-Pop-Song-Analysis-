She looks in the mirror with the makeup that don't hide the pain (oh, oh, oh)
Yeah she swore that the last time was the last time that she'd fall again (fall again)
So close yours eyes, just fall tonight
She says let this be alright, alright, alright, alright
Won't you fall down on me
So close I can feel you breathe
Tonight in the darkness with nothing to lose
If the truth is all we can see
If I fall for you, could you fall for me (could you call for me)
I've been torn up, put down, wearing my heart on my sleve (oh, oh ,oh)
Yeah, those scars that you wear, well I've got them too, can't you see (can't you see)
Yeah we both know better than this, still we can't resist (still we can't resist)
Slowly get undressed
Yeah, she does when she falls down on me
So close I can feel you breathe
Tonight in the darkness theres nothing to lose
If the truth is all we can see
If I fall for you, could you fall for me (could you call for me)
Won't you fall down on me (on me)
So close I can feel you breathe (feel you breathe)
Tonight in the darkness with nothing to lose,
If the truth is all we can see
If I fall for you, could you fall for me
She falls down on me
So close I can feel you breathe (feel you breathe)
Tonight in the darkness with nothing to lose
If the truth is all we can see (oh yeah)
If I fall for you, could you fall for me
Oh, could you fall for me
