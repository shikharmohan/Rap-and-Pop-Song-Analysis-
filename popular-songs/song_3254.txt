All hail to the N9NE
You punks thought it was over for me?
I should prevail a institation
All of the high exalted punks
TechN9ne
Move somethin', do somethin'
Scream somethin', aight
Cruel some, gruesome, hoodlums, aight
[Incomprehensible]
 V I C T O R Y
I'm still climbin', niggaz be rhymin'
While they gain lip with me
So you can keep hatin'
Now they want me makin'
Swimmin' in victory
Yo yo, they thought it was over, but I gots to bust
Call them foes, stealin' flows, that they got from us
What, we comin' through your city with lots of lust
Get the dough get ya hoes then we knock them up and kut
Still clownin', jealousy be frownin'
Keep in the street poundin'
Haters get beat down
And y'all, keep houndin'
Lookin' for new sounds
That Nina done put down
Well hey baby you found 'em
We, "Victors", invested in big Wars
We comin' to get yours, we hit till it get sore
We spit, acrobatical, never simple schematical
Vivid liquid compatible, shrooms X's and Aderals
Thought Anghellic wouldn't make it, we take it
Every time we get your girly butt naked
Real melons, still Heaven, still Helen
Still bellin' through the city, with them class ain't felons
At that bar with it, the fans know it how we are with it
Carobulou with a Church Hill cigar with it
Don't never far get it, woman gettin' targeted
600 car with it, Techa is comin' hard with it
I'm still climbin', niggaz be rhymin'
While they gain lip with me
So you can keep hatin'
Now they want me makin'
Swimmin' in victory
I'm still climbin', niggaz be rhymin'
While they gain lip with me
So you can keep hatin'
Now they want me makin'
Swimmin' in victory
All I wanna see is broads with us
Strange hella odd niggaz
Roll with them hard Hitters
That would mob with us
So God get us
Player haters that squab with us
They bob with us
'Cause the Techa-N9NE is bizarre lecture
I'm a what, party animal, horny and a punani cannibal
Can nobody calm me, the killa Dahni is a Zombie and Ho
Ladies on the dance floor
Let yo homey make you touch your toes
Skip them foes, strike a pose
Hot as hell, grab your chicken head by the tail
A lot of tail, can generate you a lot of mail
I'm the victorious, you the victom
Ya gal took my lizard and licked him
And my twins she kissed 'em
So tell me how this, tune sounds
You love it so never tune the, boom down
You never thought we be some scholars
With shrooms round, Mexican woman
And now we ballers and poon hounds
I'm still climbin', niggaz be rhymin'
While they gain lip with me
So you can keep hatin'
Now they want me makin'
Swimmin' in victory
I'm still climbin', niggaz be rhymin'
While they gain lip with me
So you can keep hatin'
Now they want me makin'
Swimmin' in victory
Yo, that's why your mama got a big 'ol butt, oh yeah
And your sister got a big 'ol butt, oh yeah
Since your mama and your sister had a big 'ol butt
They help the nina bust a big 'ol nut, oh yeah
I'm the King, niggaz that know it
That's why they want me in the ring
Hopin' I blow it but I love the cream, what I mean
No matter what kind of lyrics you write
Tech N9ne fans don't want to hear it tonight
All hail to my jail homies
Cameron, Moberly, Boomville
You can bet we soon will, bump head
A wise man once said, "Everybody want go heaven
But nobody want dead"
Numb heads, if they diss the Vette
Break the mother fuckers down if they disrespect, The Tech
This is Victory cause I gets the check
I leave you player haters glistenin' wet, punk bitch
I'm still climbin', niggaz be rhymin'
While they gain lip with me
So you can keep hatin'
Now they want me makin'
Swimmin' in victory
I'm still climbin', niggaz be rhymin'
While they gain lip with me
So you can keep hatin'
Now they want me makin'
Swimmin' in victory
I'm still climbin', niggaz be rhymin'
While they gain lip with me
So you can keep hatin'
Now they want me makin'
Swimmin' in victory
I'm still climbin', niggaz be rhymin'
While they gain lip with me
So you can keep hatin'
Now they want me makin'
Swimmin' in victory
