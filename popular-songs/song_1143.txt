Time stands still for no one
I know this is true
And I've been stuck here waiting
Then along came you
And you gave me back
The love I had
The faith I had lost
The life I knew
I wanna thank you for the love that you give me
And the sun that you put in my sky
But you don't know how much you've lifted me up
But I feel so alive that I could fly and I could fly, oh
There's no way I could've made it
This far without you
You came to me just when I needed someone to believe
That I could make it through
And you gave me back
The love I had
The faith I had lost
And the life I knew
I wanna thank you for the love that you give me
And the sun that you put in my sky
But you don't know how much you've lifted me up
But I feel so alive that I could fly above the clouds
Fly so high, never come down
Just you and I, I'm so in love
With you, with you, hey
And you gave me back
The love I had
The faith I had lost
And the life I knew
I wanna thank you for the love that you give me
And the sun that you put in my sky
You don't know how much you've lifted me up
But I feel so alive
I wanna thank you for the love that you give me
And the sun that you put in my sky
But you don't know how much you've lifted me up
But I feel so alive that I could fly and I could fly
And I could fly, I could fly, oh
I wanna spread my wings, let me tell you
Said I need your love, I need your love
Stay with me baby
Oh, I need your love, and I need your love
Stay with me baby
Oh, I need your love, I need your love
Stay with me baby
Yeah I need your love and I need your love
Stay with me, honey baby, c'mon now stay
Oh, c'mon now, yea, yea, oh oh
You and me side by side walkin'
Through the woods in the pale moonlight
Oh, yeah now and it feels so good
