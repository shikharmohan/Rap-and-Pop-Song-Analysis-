I've got something to tell you that I just can't say
So I'm writing it down in case maybe someday
Our lives take a turn down a road we can't see right now
I know you're happy and I'm happy for you
But since you found each other I've been so confused 'cause
I believe there's one soul on this earth
That was meant for mine I was sent here to find
What if it's you? What if our hearts were meant to be one?
And what'll I do? Knowing that I'll never love anyone
As much as I do love you what if it's true? What if it's you?
If destiny called and I missed my cue
Do I get one more chance oh how I wish I knew
I'll never again put my heart in the hands of fate, if it's too late
What if it's you? What if our hearts were meant to be one?
What'll I do? Knowing that I'll never love anyone
As much as I do love you what if it's true? What if it's you?
If I ever hold you I'll never let go
But if I never do how will I know?
What if it's you? What if our hearts were meant to be one?
What'll I do? Knowing that I'll never love anyone
As much as I do love you what if it's true? And what if it's you?
What'll I do? What if it's true? What if it's you?
