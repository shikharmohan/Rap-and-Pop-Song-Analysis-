               and um I could  sense dat lil mama been 
               drinkin 2 much,dis wat I tell her.
 
                 (Voice): I told her hop in,
               friends don't let friends drive 
               drunk.Hop in friends don't let friends 
                  drive drunk. Hop in! Hop-Hop in!
