La la la la
Wait till I get my money right
I had a dream I can buy my way to Heaven
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'll be back in a second
Man, it's so hard not to act reckless
To hold much is given, much is tested
Get arrested, got some chilli, get the message
I feel the pressure under more scrutiny
And what I do? Act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry, more Louis V
My momma couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel, man
I ain't one of the Cosbys, I ain't go to Hill, man
I guess the money should've changed him
I guess I should've forget where I came from
La la la la
Wait till I get my money right
La la la la
Then you can't tell me nothing right
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing
Let up the suicide doors
This is my life, homey, you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldn't tell you who decide wars
So I parrallel double parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking 'bout back in my day
But homey, this is my day
Class started two hours ago, oh, am I late?
Know I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh, they so sensitive
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon' end up apologing
Let me know if it's a problem, man
Aight man, holla then
La la la la
Wait till I get my money right
La la la la
Then you can't tell me nothing right
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing
Let the champagne splash
Let that man get cash, let that man get pass
You don't needa stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors
He can drive off the fumes 'cause
How you move in a room full of nose?
How you stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharoahs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure, what's your pleasure?
Life is a, huh, depending how you dress her
So if the 'Devil Wear Prada', Adam, Eve wear nada
I'm in between but way more fresher
With way less effort 'cause when you try hard
That's when you 'Die Hard'
Ya homies looking like, "Why God?"
When they reminisce over You, my God
La la la la
Wait till I get my money right
La la la la
Then you can't tell me nothing right
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing
La la la la
Wait till I get my money right
La la la la
Then you can't tell me nothing right
