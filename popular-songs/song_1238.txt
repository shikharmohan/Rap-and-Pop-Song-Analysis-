Hot temper with the shortest fuse
You're such a mess with an attitude
You're working hard but you're paying more
You never talk if you don't have to
You had a job but you hate the man
Who takes it all like Uncle Sam
I want you, you, you, you, you, you, you
I, I, I, I, I, I, I want you
Out of gas, so you walk for miles
To pick me up in your worn out shoes
You never settle, never take too much
You count on me just like I count on you
Kiss me like when I first saw you
Figured out couldn't be without you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you
I, I, I, I, I, I, I want you
I want you, you, you, you, you, you, you
I, I, I, I, I, I, I want you
No one else will do
I want, no one makes me smile
I want, no one gets me how
I want, no one else it's you, you, you
I want you, you, you, you, you, you, you
I, I, I, I, I, I, I want you
I want you, you, you, you, you, you, you
I, I, I, I, I, I, I want you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're so hot tempered with the shortest fuse
You're such a mess and with an attitude
You, you, you, you, you, you, you
I, I, I, I, I, I, I want you
I want you, you, you, you, you, you, you
I, I, I, I, I, I, I want, I want, I want, I want
No one else will do
I want, no one makes me smile
I want, no one gets me how
I want, no one else it's you, you, you
I want you, you, you, you, you, you, you
I, I, I, I, I, I, I want you
I want you, you, you, you, you, you, you
I, I, I, I, I, I, I want you, I, I want you
You and me walking together
Screwing up for worse or for better
You, you, you, you, you, you, you
I, I, I, I, I, I, I want you
