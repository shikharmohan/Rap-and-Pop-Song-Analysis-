I set out on a narrow way
many years ago
hoping I would find true love 
along the broken road
but I got lost a time or two
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through
Couldn't see how every sign 
pointed strait to you
every long lost dream
led me to where you are
others who broke my heart
they were like northern stars
pointing me on my way
into your loving arms
this much I know is true
that God blessed the broken road
that led me  strait to
Led me straight to you
others who broke my heart
they were like northern stars
pointing me on my way
into your loving arms
this much I know is true
that God blessed the broken road
that led me straight to you
