What what what?
Hey!
Yeah, you
You had a dark sexy vibe about ya
And in a strange way, you turn me on
The way you look said a lot about ya
As if you really didn't give a uhh!
I told myself not to fall for you
'Cause I can see that you don't follow rules
I should've just walked away
But your eyes were telling me to stay
Damn, why do the wild ones turn me on?
It's like cherry pie, you can't deny it
Driving fast, you had to try it, that's what it feels like
Letting Tony touch you everywhere
Breaking rules and didn't care, that's what it feels like
A real rebel kinda fella
The kind that I would never trust
I could read what your mind was thinking
It's like you still didn't give a hey!
It's funny how those kind of guys
Have a way of getting what they want
And even good girls though they try
You see they just can't seem to stay away
Damn, why do the wild ones turn me on?
It's like cherry pie, you can't deny it
Driving fast, you had to try it, that's what it feels like
Letting Tony touch you everywhere
Breaking rules and didn't care, that's what it feels like
It's like cherry pie, you can't deny it
Driving fast you had to try it, oh that's what it feels like
Letting Tony touch you everywhere
Breaking rules and didn't care, oh baby, that's what it feels like
I can be your cherry pie
And you can be my cream on top, come on!
I can be your cherry pie
And you can be my cream on top
It's like cherry pie, you can't deny it
Driving fast, you had to try it, oh, that's what it feels like
Letting Tony touch you everywhere
Breaking rules and didn't care, oh baby, that's what it feels like
It's like cherry pie, you can't deny it
Driving fast, you had to try it
Letting Tony touch you everywhere
Breaking rules and didn't care, yeah, yeah
