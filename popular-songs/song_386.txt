I can't stand this fallin' for you
Every time I see you, I keep crawlin' towards you
I can't take this achin' feelin'
This cold heart breakin' feelin'
I can't stand this fallin' for you
Well I hang my head by the riverside
Burst its banks with the tears I've cried
The ripples roll out to the sea
I wish they was washin' over me
I can't stand this fallin' for you
Every time I see you, I keep crawlin' towards you
I can't take this achin' feelin'
This cold heart breakin' feelin'
I can't stand this fallin' for you
Every time I see you, I keep crawlin' towards you
I can't take this achin' feelin'
This cold heart breakin' feelin'
I can't stand this fallin' for you
Well your blood is red but your soul is black
Don't believe I'm a comin' back
And now I know why the willows weep
The tide is high and the water's deep
I can't stand
i can't take
I can't stand this fallin' for you
Every time I see you, I keep crawlin' towards you
I can't take this achin' feelin'
This cold heart breakin' feelin'
I can't stand this fallin' for you
Every time I see you, I keep crawlin' towards you
I can't take this achin' feelin'
This cold heart breakin' feelin'
I can't stand
I can't take
I can't stand this fallin' for you
