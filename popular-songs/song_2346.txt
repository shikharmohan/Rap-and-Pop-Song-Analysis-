[Verse One]
I've been noticing you been going in and out when you feel the need baby
But I can't help but to wonder where Ã¢Â¦ where you areeee (awwhh no)
See I've done my dirt, chasing all them skirts all around the world I've done my do. 
But when it comes to you I will loose my head, but it's hard to sleep alone
[Chorus] 
And I know when I'm away
You miss me all day
But driving me crazy girl I'm fiening you
Dont you leave me all alone 
I'll be back 4sho
Just so that you know girl I'm fiening you
When you need to be relaxed lay down on your back
Know who you can ask 'cause I'm fiening you
Baby know all threw the day you keep me in my place
One thought of your face and I fiening you

When you're not around, baby girl I'm down and out 'cause I'm thinking about you (whoaaa)

Or if this means nothing (whoaaa)

And I know when I'm away
