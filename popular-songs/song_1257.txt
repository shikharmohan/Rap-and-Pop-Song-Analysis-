I don't believe in the smile that you leave
When you walk away and say goodbye
Well, I don't expect the world to move underneath me
But for God's sake could you try?
I know that you're true to me
You're always there
You say, you care
I know that you want to be mine
Where is your heart? 'Cause I don't really feel you
Where is your heart? What I really want is to believe you
Is it so hard to give me what I need? I want your heart to bleed
That's all I'm askin' for oh, where is your heart?
I don't understand your love is so cold
It's always me who's reachin' out for your hand
And I've always dreamed that love would be effortless
Like a petal fallin' to the ground a dreamer followin' his dream
Where is your heart? 'Cause I don't really feel you
Where is your heart? What I really want is to believe you
Is it so hard to give me what I need? I want your heart to bleed
That's all I'm askin' for oh, where is your heart?
It seems so much is left unsaid
So much is left unsaid
But you can say anything
Oh, anytime you need
Baby, it's just you and me oh, yeah
I know that you're true to me
You're always there
You say, you care
I know that you want to be mine
Where is your heart? 'Cause I don't really feel you
Where is your heart? What I really want is to believe you
Is it so hard to give me what I need? I want your heart to bleed
That's all I'm askin' for oh yeah
Where is your heart? 'Cause I don't really feel you
Where is your heart? What I really want is to believe you
Is it so hard to give me what I need? I want your heart to bleed
That's all I'm askin' for, where is your heart?
Where is your heart?
Where is your heart?
Where is your heart?
