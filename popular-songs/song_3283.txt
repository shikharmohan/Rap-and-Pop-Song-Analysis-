[Intro]
Hello Mr. Yates
This is Sarah from the Complex ClubHouse
I'm calling to tell you
That we've been getting complaints
From your neighbors about loud music late at night
If you can keep it low after 10pm it would be appreciated
Thanks!
[Chorus][Tech N9ne & Irv Da Phenom]
(Yeah I play my music loud!)
I bet you feel me comin' down the block
With that thunder in the trunk on N9ne 
(You know I play my music loud!)
Yep I got them neighbors losin' sleep
From the way I crank it up and let it beat
(YEAH)
Turn it up like boom boom boom boom
Let it beat like bang bang bang bang
Turn it up like boom boom boom boom
Let it beat like bang bang bang bang
Turn it up like boom boom boom boom 
Let it beat like bang bang bang bang
Turn it up like boom boom boom boom
Let it Bang, Let it Bang.
[Bizzy]
Pulled up in a bucket
Blowin' on a blunt
Beat hittin like prrumpa-pomp-pomp
I don't crack I crease sound like a big bitch
In the back like a big bitch 
Tryin' get up out a lil' niggas trunk
Turn heads for I even hit the block
Lil' kids runnin' up when they hear the beat knock
Cranked to the max whenever I pass cops
Heart Skippa beat whenever the bass drop
My shit is quaken
Got my rear-view vibratin'
Pulled up next my gran-mommy at the red light got her wig shaken
Gunna see her burp and its what im tastin'
Gunna do some baby makin'
Gotta chop that first then
Next three bitch
Look likes annihilation
Sunday mornin' round eleven
Roll by interuptin' a reverend
I'll prolly lose my hearin' by the time im twenty-seven
It's a shame
But I need that bang
So vibrate my frame
FPS my game
Have ta do a little switch up
Can I play against strange
I tell my Biatress to quit yappin'
Later on we gon get nasty
And you can do whateva you like to me 
We can do it classy or get trashy
Matta fact we ain't even gotta go to the crib girl
We can do it in the back seat
But for now sit back, relax and let this beat massage your ass cheeks
[Chorus][Tech N9ne & Irv Da Phenom]
(Yeah I play my music loud!)
I bet you feel me comin' down the block
With that thunder in the trunk on N9ne 
(You know I play my music loud!)
Yep I got them neighbors losin' sleep
From the way I crank it up and let it beat
(YEAH)
Turn it up like boom boom boom boom
Let it beat like bang bang bang bang
Turn it up like boom boom boom boom
Let it beat like bang bang bang bang
Turn it up like boom boom boom boom 
Let it beat like bang bang bang bang
Turn it up like boom boom boom boom
Let it Bang, Let it Bang.

It's Smooth Prada
Jesus that nigga that came with the heat that you needed
Along awaited on, hella hated on 
Hungry little nigga bought to eat until the plate is gone
Got the flamer on
Bout to step into the danger zone
Might as well go ahead and call the cops
Cause them loud ass next door neighbors is home
Yeah, and we comin' to tear the block up
Beat it loud, bang it like Blokka
Them witches jock us
That's why these niggas mock us
But they not us and its not just
Music with me and my partners
We don't put time in this bitch so how could you stop us
(Prada)
What?
(Gettum)
Can I get up in the middle for the money
For the women and the niggas in the city
That said I would never make it but im here now
Got it made now, Gettin' hoes now, gettin' laid now
So brotha lay down, gettin' paid now
You motha' fuckas shouldn't have nothin' to say now 
Got a middle finger for y'all, scratch that
Man I ain't even thinkin' uh y'all, pass that 
So pass the cat to the back where im sittin' at
Put your kitty cat on I laugh and I get it now
Roll the windows down and let the beats out
Alan Wayne and Strange you can't beat that now
That what its all about boy
Got me hatin' on a nigga 
Cause a nigga got a little bita cloud boy
Shit talks, Shit anyways
So turn my mother fuckin' music up, shut your mother fuckin' mouth boy
[Chorus][Tech N9ne & Irv Da Phenom]
(Yeah I play my music loud!)
I bet you feel me comin' down the block
With that thunder in the trunk on N9ne 
(You know I play my music loud!)
Yep I got them neighbors losin' sleep
From the way I crank it up and let it beat
(YEAH)
Turn it up like boom boom boom boom
Let it beat like bang bang bang bang
Turn it up like boom boom boom boom
Let it beat like bang bang bang bang
Turn it up like boom boom boom boom 
Let it beat like bang bang bang bang
Turn it up like boom boom boom boom
Let it Bang, Let it Bang.
[Tech N9ne]
Better want me ta live at the end of my block
Cause when I get to the krilla I don't stop
Party'n my ladys, I pull up in the Mercedes
You know that we gunna BANG BIG SOUND
We kickin' it loud at 3 o'clock at the spot
Spread the liquor around we doin' shots till we drop
Every once in a while we get a knock from the cops saying TURN SHIT DOWN
(Yep)
My neighbors probably wish I resided in hella prison
Cause' they always tell me and Mac to turn down our television
And we got it hooked to our stereo you would think the scenario's
Runnin' the lights when I get on mic 
When the bass kick hit very low
I can't help it cause I like it loud
I hype the crowd, I party and to spike the clouds
It might be fowl, the neighbors wanna fight me now
When the night be growl
The women excite me wow
So to be buyin' button cause I'm bustin' his name
I don't want nobody hearin' us when we vein
So I turned the music up and lust till he came
Now I know the neighbors no what my name
Can't help it cause that's my style
More beat then the law will allow
I'm bout ta get me a crib in the country
No body to hunt me, tellin' me TURN IT DOWN
I'm gunna live it really black and proud
Off in the yard naked and well endowed
Until the cops run up on me and then I crack a smile
[Chorus][Tech N9ne & Irv Da Phenom]
(Yeah I play my music loud!)
I bet you feel me comin' down the block
With that thunder in the trunk on N9ne 
(You know I play my music loud!)
Yep I got them neighbors losin' sleep
From the way I crank it up and let it beat
(YEAH)
Turn it up like boom boom boom boom
Let it beat like bang bang bang bang
Turn it up like boom boom boom boom
Let it beat like bang bang bang bang
Turn it up like boom boom boom boom 
Let it beat like bang bang bang bang
Turn it up like boom boom boom boom
Let it Bang, Let it Bang.
