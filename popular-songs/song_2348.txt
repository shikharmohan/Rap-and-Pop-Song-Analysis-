Go 'head from the top
Yeah, turn my music up, good
Omarion, shall we?
You know, I can feel your presence
Come closer, yeah
You turn me on, you flip the switch
I feel the current pushin' me, pullin' me close to you
Shocks in my system, there's an attraction
Look how I'm actin' hard for me to keep my cool
Vibrations, I feel it in my chest
When we touch, there's a charge I get
There is an energy that I just can't control
It's electric, oh
When it takes over me, I let myself go
It's electric, oh, so, so electric
Let's start some static, a bit of friction
Feel so magnetic, pullin' me more into you, oh
I got you open, the waves are flowin'
So now you're glowin', I knew you were feelin' me too
Vibrations, I can feel it in my chest
When we touch, there's a charge I get
There is an energy that I just can't control
It's electric, oh
When it takes over me, I let myself go
It's electric, oh, so, so electric
It lives inside of me
A separate entity
I can hear its heartbeat
It's electric, it's electric, it's electric
There is an energy that I just can't control
It's electric, oh
When it takes over me, I let myself go
It's electric, oh, so, so electric
Give it to me
You gotta watch me
'Cuz you know I'm dancin', right?
It's electric, oh
It's electric, oh, so, so electric
It's electric, oh
It's electric, oh, so, so electric
