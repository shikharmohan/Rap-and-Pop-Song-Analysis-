Early in the afternoon
Is the only time my mind is clear
To think of you and the love we knew
It's a memory I hold so dear
Now we're apart I've got a broken heart
The tears fall so sincere
I know it's wrong but before too long
It's gonna be whiskey and beer
Last call for alcohol still ringin' in my head
You must've ordered two more double shots
From the shape that you're in
There ain't no stoppin' my bar hoppin'
I should've stayed home instead
Last call for alcohol still ringin' in my head
You've got to stop the way you're living
You better change your short life ways
Smokin', drinkin' and lovin'
You're just numberin' your days
Though I know what I need to do
If I could just turn around today
But her memory catches up with me
And this bar stool's where I'll stay
Last call for alcohol still ringin' in my head
You must've ordered two more double shots
From the shape that you're in
There ain't no stoppin' my bar hoppin'
I should've stayed home instead
Last call for alcohol still ringin' in my head
Last call for alcohol still ringin' in my head
You must've ordered two more double shots
From the shape that you're in
There ain't no stoppin' my bar hoppin'
I should've stayed home instead
Last call for alcohol still ringin' in my head
Last call for alcohol still ringin' in my head
