I'm just a blank sheet of paper
This fool's about to write you a letter
To tell you that he's sorry
For the way he did you wrong
To ask for your forgiveness for leavin' you alone
He's been lookin' down at me seems like forever
Takes the top on and off his pen
It's like he can't decide
Just what he wants to say
He'd just tell the truth I'd be on my way
But he just stares at me, I just stare at him
He don't know where to start
To say, he doesn't want it to end
Now it's one hour later
And I'm still a blank sheet of paper
Sunlight is shinin' through the curtains
He's almost asleep pen in hand
There's a tear in his eye that refuses to fall
If it would land on me that would say it all
But he just stares at me, I just stare at him
He don't know where to start
To say, he doesn't want it to end
Now it's four hours later
And I am still a blank sheet of paper
And he just stares at me, I just stare at him
He don't know where to start
To say, he wants it back again
Now, one broken heart, later
I'm still a blank sheet of paper
