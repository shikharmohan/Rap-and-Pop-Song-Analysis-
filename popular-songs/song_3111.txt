Do you know what it's like to feel so high
then suddenly it happens, you just feel so low.
before you could even cry.
So stop listen, for another sound
and before it know it,
You're just one little thing, wanderin' around.
Drive to the mountain it's straight ahead.
but don't climb before you've left.
Reach another goal, and set a new one
you've got a whole life ahead of you
so, don't let these things, bring you down
Oh, but don't worry.  It maybe, one of those times, where you feel so high, so low.
So now you know what it's like to feel so high then it hits you right there
You're on low road again!
Go to mountains.
It's all you've got now.  Don't let anything bring you down.
Cause' you got a long way ahead of you now.
La la la la la la la
ooh oh oh ooh
la la la la la!
So just be yourself.  But never forget, So high so low.
