You don't have a clue
You're so far gone
He's got you dancin' to
A siren song
I wouldn't wanna be you right now
I wouldn't wanna be
I wouldn't wanna be you right now
I wouldn't wanna be, I wouldn't wanna be
You're not the first he's drawn
To his flame
He means to do you wrong
He has no shame
I wouldn't wanna be you right now
I wouldn't wanna be
I wouldn't wanna be you right now
I wouldn't wanna be, I wouldn't wanna be you
It's easy to understand
How you could fall so hard
You're not the only one
He's taken in and torn apart
Won't say I told you so
But I'm afraid it's true
You're about to go
What I went through
I wouldn't wanna be you right now
I wouldn't wanna be
I wouldn't wanna be you right now
I wouldn't wanna be, I wouldn't wanna be you
It's easy to understand
How you could fall so hard
You're not the only one
He's taken in and torn apart
Wouldn't wanna be you right now
I wouldn't wanna be you
I wouldn't wanna be you right now
I wouldn't wanna be
I wouldn't wanna be you right now
I wouldn't wanna be
I wouldn't wanna be you right now
I wouldn't wanna be you right now
I wouldn't wanna be you right now
I wouldn't wanna be
I wouldn't wanna be you right now
I wouldn't wanna be you
Wouldn't wanna be you right now
