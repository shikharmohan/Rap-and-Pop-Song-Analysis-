Show this, stressful, everybody wanna call,
Gotta tell em naw, sometimes
Sit up in the record store
Seven hundred fans, man, everyone signs
And it gets so hard telling em all please try to form one line
But the player-haters combine
I don't think you know
How much of a strain it's been
I can't explain
It's insane
But I wouldn't give up a thang
Live with the pain
And resort to brain trippin'
I need a little release,
Something to stop my rage
I really need me a moment of peace
So baby girl wanna step on stage  
Flash
Like its mardi gras
Flash, 
Girl take off your bra
Flash, 
Talking to all of ya'll
Flash,
This is a party call
Flash
Theres song ain't about your 
ass
But I really love it when you
Pass
If you want me we can 
Smash
My Baby doll
(2x)
I really love it,
I can see them from the front row to the back
And it's beautiful, I've imagined this
Since I was a you, now that I'm
Old enough
Girls that are
Small enough
Grab your shirts
Roll it up
Even if you an A-cup girl, we can still play touch
If you a B and C cup, girl I bet you could make me erupt
D Cups, be the ones that are driving me nuts
Big breasts never trouble me
If you packin the double D, 
Let everyone whos double E
Angelina Jolie, let me see those
Beautiful babies I'm all about the tedos
Miss Jackson packin them holy toledos
Missed the flash cause I didn't have Tivo
Ask me who's finer, player I'mma yell Tyra
Little sick in the head, still got the magazine of El Vira
Life is so grand, when you got your fans
Blasting off their shirts, flashing their Lindsay Lohans
I got a pocket full of Trojans, 
We can all get nasty if you flash me baby, 
You know the program
Chorus (2x)
Girls in the back, come to the front
Cause we in need of cleavage
And I've been looking at you,
Yep you and your home girl
Let me see both of them, now grab a hold of them
Look at what you're doing to me
Now grab a hold of him
Ah, such a nice sensation
You know the dogs been waiting
For you to quickly take off your Vickie
And show me your augmentation
Silicone or saline,
Either one puts me in a day dream
Talking about it gets me way steamed
Baby girl, this regime
When you see me, baby lift it up
Thinking I'm gonna miss it, nigga, what?
if I miss one (back it up)
(Stick me, he looks tacular)
From city to city crazy
Heres your instructions:
Show me them titties baby! 
Chorus (2x)
Traveling for miles and miles
Girls gone wild love this peculiar style
So in order for us to get our head right
We need all your ladies
To turn on your headlights
