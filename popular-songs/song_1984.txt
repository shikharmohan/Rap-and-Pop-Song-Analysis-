Lets not make this harder than it gots to be
I dont like you, you dont like me
But we tried(right)
Lets not take this farther than it gots to go

And its seeming this is for the best 
cause to me girl your just added stress

Its been broke too many times before

And its seeming we should be apart
Cause this was over before it got to start
Keep yours ill keep my heart
