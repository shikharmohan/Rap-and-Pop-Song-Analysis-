I know I break your heart everything I know donÃÂ¢€t ever give up on me remember that were strong even as we fall donÃÂ¢€t ever give up on me each tears im holding back oh would turn my whole face black and I dont know if u love me if its only like that would you. (Chorus) would you u follow if I turn my back could u love me through this broken place I know im not who I was or that I need to be but donÃÂ¢€t ever give up on me donÃÂ¢€t ever up on me. (Vurse 2) My heart would tend to run even when Im gone donÃÂ¢€t ever give up on me im trying deep within if u could hold my hand donÃÂ¢€t ever give up on me this war im fighting hell it turns me inside out and I donÃÂ¢€t know if u love me if u saw me rite now would you. (Chorus) would you follow if I turn my back could u love me through this broken place I know im not who I was or that I need to be donÃÂ¢€t ever give up on me donÃÂ¢€t ever give up on me.
(Vurse3) How do u how do u still believe in me even when even when all my colorsÃÂ¢€ bleed holding out holding out will u love the rest of me. (Chorus)
Would you u follow if I turn my back could u love me through this broken place I know im not who I was or not who I was to be but donÃÂ¢€t ever give up on me donÃÂ¢€t ever give up on me.
