If I died today, who'd turn off my coffee pot?
Would there be a street parade?
Would I just be an afterthought?
If I died today, would I still be a waiter?
Could I fly around like Superman?
Would I make the Sunday paper?
I wonder who I'd see cryin' standin' over me
And who would just send their regards
Would anybody say, "At least he's in a better place"?
And who would get this old guitar?
If I died today, would my mama keep on prayin'?
Would my buddies go out drinkin'?
Would my alarm clock keep on blinkin'?
And if I died today, would I need to be ashamed?
Would I be easy to forget?
Could I live with my regrets?
I wonder who I'd see cryin' standin' over me
And who would just send their regards
Would anybody say the world will never be the same?
And who would get this old guitar?
If I died today, could I see my room from heaven?
Would my family talk about me
Every Christmas and Thanksgivin'?
I wonder who I'd see cryin' standin' over me
And who would just send their regards
Would anybody say what a good guy, what a shame?
And who would get this old guitar?
If I died today, who'd turn off my coffee pot?
