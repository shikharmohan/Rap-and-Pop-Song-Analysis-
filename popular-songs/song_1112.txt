You come here lookin' for sympathy
'Cause it's not everything you thought it would be
Don't waste your time, you can't understand why it comes and goes
The sudden storms, the highs and lows
So you stand here cryin', girl get in line
What love is that way, you're waitin' time pretending
What love is that way, when you walk through life
Expecting so much, so soon love can only hurt you
What love is that way what love is ever that way
The more you wish and the more you dream
The more the reality never seems, what it ought to be
It's never perfect as when it begins
Time always seems to put an end to the fantasy, it seems to me
What love is that way, you're waitin' time pretending
What love is that way, when you walk through life
Expecting so much, so soon love can only hurt you
What love is that way what love is ever that way
So much, so soon, love can only hurt you
What love is that way, what love is ever that way
What love is that way
So much, so soon, love can only hurt you
What love is that way, what love is ever that way
What love is that way
So much, so soon, love can only hurt you
What love is that way, what love is ever that way
What love is that way
