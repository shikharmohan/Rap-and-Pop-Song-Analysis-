I want a Sunday kind of love
A love to last, past Saturday night
And I'd like to know it's more than love at first sight
I want a Sunday kind of love
And I want a, a love that's on the square
Can't seem to find somebody, someone to care
And I'm on a lonely road that leads to nowhere
I need a Sunday kind of love
I do all my Sunday dreaming, and all my scheming
Every minute, every hour, every day
And I'm hoping to discover a certain kind of
Lover who will show me the way
And my arms need someone to enfold
To keep me warm when Monday's and Tuesday's grow cold
And I need a love for all my life to have
And to hold
I want a Sunday kind of love, I don't want a
Monday or a Tuesday, Wednesday or a Thursday
Friday or Saturday I don't want nothing baby
I want a Sunday kind of love
