This yo girl ciara wit young weezy
See this is how it goes...
I am the girl 
that rides around in 28
I'm from ATL me and my boo bow-weezy
We soon going to be getting married 
But let me flip it over to ya boy lil weezy
Weezy- Ima fireman Ima soldier and lova
Im the type to keep you fresh to death
I like to ryme i'll take ya to the new orleans and have a good time
me and the beautiful ciara
Chorus- thius is the girl
that you know
and if you mess wit me
ima sit you on fire
