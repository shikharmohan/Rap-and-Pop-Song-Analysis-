I'm not gonna make you croon
Something else, something new
I'm not gonna make you dream
Suicide is something mean
I'm not gonna make you gruel
It's something else, it's something new
I'm not gonna make you through
It's something else, it's something new
Hold it in your gut, hold it your gut
Hold it in your gut, hold it your gut
Hold it in your gut, hold it your gut
Hold it in your gut, hold it your gut
I'm not gonna make you croon
Something sad, something blue
I'm not gonna make you scream
Suicide is something mean
I'm not gonna make it through
Something else, it's something new
I'm not gonna make you dream
In this hour, it's something mean
Hold it in your gut, hold it your gut
Hold it in your gut, hold it your gut
Hold it in your gut, hold it your gut
Hold it in your gut, hold it your gut
Hold it in your gut, hold it your gut
Hold it in your gut, hold it your gut
Hold it in your gut, hold it your gut
Hold it in your gut, hold it your gut
Gut
Gut
Gut
