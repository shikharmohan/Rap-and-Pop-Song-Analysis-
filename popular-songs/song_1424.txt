He'll be sweatin' a whole life long just to get this right
It's a work hard, hit hard struggle, it's a sacrifice
It's time to blow it up, time to lock and load
Time to take the field, time to start the show
This is our moment, this is our time
And we ain't holding back, we're laying it all on the line
This is our destiny, it's our night to shine
This is our moment, this is our time
We been playing guitars and bangin' drums since we were boys
Tryin' to impress pretty girls with a lot of noise
It's time to turn it up, time to rock and roll
Time to take the stage, time to start the show
This is our moment, this is our time
And we ain't holding back, we're laying it all on the line
This is our destiny, it's our night to shine
This is our moment, this is our time
