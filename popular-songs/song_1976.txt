I must be honest with you baby , just gotta be honest
I love to watch the faces that you make, when we make love
But when I'm behind you holding your hips
And you close your eyes and bite your lips, I can't see you
So might I suggest a change
Lil' mama please don't think me strange
For what I'm about to say to you
Please don't think me strange
If you know anything about me by now
You know I'm a freak, just follow my lead
Baby, I love making love in front of the mirror
So that I can watch you enjoying me
Baby tonight let's try in front of the mirror
Watching ourselves make love, girl, why don't we?
Lil' mama keep your chin up please watch me do the nasty
I like it when you make it move fast
Mami if I pull your head back 'cuz I want you to see that
We look so good together, good together
I understand that you're not ready for me
To make my directorial debut featuring me and starring you
Baby that's okay with me
Honestly this is the next best thing, baby I
Love making love in front of the mirror
So that I can watch you enjoying me
Baby tonight let's try in front of the mirror
Watching ourselves make love, girl, why don't we?
I see you, can you see me watching you lovin' it
I see you, can you see me watching you lovin' it
I see you, can you see me watching you lovin' it
I see you, can you see me watching you lovin' it
I see you, can you see me watching you lovin' it
I see you, can you see me watching you lovin' it
I see you, can you see me watching you lovin' it
I see you, can you see me watching you lovin' it
Love making love in front of the mirror
So that I can watch you enjoying me
Baby tonight let's try in front of the mirror
Watching ourselves make love, girl, why don't we?
Can we make love in front of a mirror, babe?
