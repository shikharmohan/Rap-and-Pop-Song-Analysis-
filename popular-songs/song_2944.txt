No Good, Two Timin', Lies comin' outta your mouth.
Cheatin', mistreatin' games that you play brought you down.
Broke my heart, tore it apart, look who's got the last laugh now.
Don't you come crawlin' begging please on your knees, baby if you're missin' me.
(Chorus)
Well, you can hear me on the radio!
You wanna turn me on, turn on your stereo.
You can sing along, while they're playin' our song. How you done me wrong...
Baby crank it up!
Until you blow the speakers out your Chevy truck.
So listen Romeo, when you're feelin' kinda lonely, let me tell you where to go.
Turn On The Radio!
Try to call, twitter me, text until your fingers bleed.
Oh! The DJ's the only way you*re ever gonna hear from me.
If you're reminiscing, and you're missin me this much, and you really wanna stay in touch.
(Chorus)
Well, you can hear me on the radio!
You wanna turn me on, turn on your stereo.
You can sing along, while they're playin' my song. How you done me wrong...
Baby crank it up!
Until you blow the speakers out your Chevy truck.
So listen Romeo, when you're feelin' kinda lonely, let me tell you where to go. Oh
Turn On The Radio!
Whoaaoooa!
Turn On The Radio!
Turn On The Radio
Oh!Oh!OhOhOh!Oh!Ohh!
(Chorus)
Oh! You can hear me on the radio!
You wanna turn me on, turn on your stereo.
You can sing along, while they're playin' my song. How you done me wrong...
Baby crank it up!
Until you blow the speakers out your Chevy truck.
So listen Romeo, when you're feelin' kinda lonely, let me tell you where to go.
When you're feelin' kinda lonely.
Turn On The Radio!
Turn On The Radio!
Turn On, Turn On The Radio!
Turn On The Radio!
Turn On The Radio, Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Ohhh!
Turn On The Radio!
