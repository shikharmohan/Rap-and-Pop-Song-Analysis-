I was born three months too early
The doctor gave me thirty days
But I must've had my momma's will
And God's amazing grace
I guess I'll keep on livin' even if this loves to die for
'Cause your bags are packed and I ain't cryin'
Your walking out and I'm not tryin'
To change your mind 'cause I was born to be
The baby girl without a chance
A victim of the circumstance
The one who oughta give up
But she's just too hard headed
A single mom who works two jobs
Who loves her kids and never stops
With gentle hands and a heart of a fighter
I'm a survivor
I don't believe in self-pity
It only brings you down
Maybe the queen of broken hearts
But I don't hide behind the crown
When the deck is stacked against me
I just play a different game
My roots are planted in the past
And though my life is changing fast
Who I am is who I wanna be
The baby girl without a chance
A victim of circumstance
The one who oughta give up
But she's just too hard headed
A single mom who works two jobs
Who loves her kids and never stops
With gentle hands and a heart of a fighter
I'm a survivor
Oh, a single mom who works two jobs
Who loves her kids and never stops
With gentle hands and a heart of a fighter
I'm a survivor
But I must've had my momma's will
And God's amazing grace
I'm a survivor
