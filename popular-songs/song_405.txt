Here she comes down the road
Rattling the gravel with the radio
Kicking out, some loud honky tonk song
Here we go, buckle up
Put us both together in a pickup truck
Gonna be memories all night long
Might get wild I know
But here she comes, here we go
Ready or not
When she pulls the trigger I'm a load of buckshot
One little kiss
It's a match to the fuse, the last bell at school
A kick to the bull at the rodeo
Here she comes, here we go!
Here she comes with a plan
Said she heard about a joint with a country band
Where they play George Strait, that's all
Here we go, walking in
She's making every hat in the whole place spin around
Checking out that walk
Girls wish she'd just stay home
But here she comes, here we go!
Ready or not
When she pulls the trigger I'm a load of buckshot
One little kiss
It's a match to the fuse, the last bell at school
A kick to the bull at the rodeo
Here she comes, here we go!
Here she comes with that look
Mmm, that says she'd rather be alone and that's all it took
Here we go out to that spot
Where we turn on the radio and the headlights off
Now she's moving in real close
Here she comes, here we go!
Ready or not
When she pulls the trigger I'm a load of buckshot
One little kiss
It's a match to the fuse, the last bell at school
Ready or not
When she pulls the trigger I'm a load of buckshot
One little kiss
It's a match to the fuse, the last bell at school
A kick to the bull at the rodeo
Here she comes, here we go!
