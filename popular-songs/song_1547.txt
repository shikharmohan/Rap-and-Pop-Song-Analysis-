My babyÃÂ¢€s sweet talkinÃÂ¢€ the cable man
While IÃÂ¢€m a digginÃÂ¢€ around up here
SweatinÃÂ¢€ my %# off in the attic
Trying to find the rabbit ears
The screen doors off the hinges
And thereÃÂ¢€s a flat tire on the Olds
And this GE Fridgerator ainÃÂ¢€t keeping nothinÃÂ¢€ froze
WeÃÂ¢€re falling apart together
Well itÃÂ¢€s another flash light dinner in the dark Mmm Hmm
When times get hard
We just shake us on a little more salt and pepper
Yeah the good thing is we might be falling apart
But weÃÂ¢€re falling apart together
Well I got me some good friends that swing a hammer at a nail
But there ainÃÂ¢€t no houses going up
AinÃÂ¢€t no checks in the mail
Well the gas tanks might be empty
But the tail gates still full
We pass a guitar and a bottle around
Everybody take a pull
WeÃÂ¢€re falling apart together
Well itÃÂ¢€s another flash light dinner in the dark Mmm Hmm
When times get hard
We just shake us on a little more salt and pepper
Yeah the good thing is we might be falling apart
But weÃÂ¢€re falling apart together
These days ainÃÂ¢€t stayinÃÂ¢€ forever
TheyÃÂ¢€re gonna get better
But till they do
WeÃÂ¢€ll be falling apart together
Well itÃÂ¢€s another flash light dinner in the dark Mmm Hmm
When times get hard
We'll just shake us on a little more salt and pepper
Yeah the good thing is we might be falling apart
But weÃÂ¢€re falling apart together
