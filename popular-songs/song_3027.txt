(janis carnes, rick carnes, chip hardy)
Chorus:
Pins and needles
Needles and pins
One by one I feel them at my heart again
I think I'm getting over you and then
Pins and needles
Needles and pins
I don't know why
I get uneasy
Every time I hear your name
I feel a sting from every memory
That we made
Repeat chorus
That tiny ache
Can always find me
Anytime that you are near
Those little things
Can still remind me
That you don't care
Repeat chorus
(pins and needles
Pins and needles
Pins and needles
Needles and pins)
