He hasn't seen a drop of rain for months it seems
Rollin river is nothing but a tricklin' stream
The crops are dyin' in the harsh sun light
Dust on his tongue is dry
The fatted calf is down to skin and bones, we carry on
Alone in the city and she's only seventeen
The boy left her black and blue on the streets so mean
Just twelve weeks along and she's got a life inside
Says shes' never ever felt so alone
She walks in the shelter, they say welcome home
And we carry on when our lives come undone
We carry on 'cause there's promise in the mornin' sun
We carry on as the dark surrenders to the dawn
We were born to overcome, we carry on
Beyond the picket fences and the oil wells
The happy endings and the fairy tales
Is the reality of shattered lives and
Broken dreams, we carry on, carry on
It's the family that grieves for a lost loved one
It's the soldier who wont leave 'til the job is done
It's the addict trying to turn his life around
It's pickin' yourself up off the ground
When you've been knocked down
We carry on when our lives come undone
We carry on 'cause there's promise in the mornin' sun
We carry on as the dark surrenders to the dawn
We were born to overcome
We carry on when our lives come undone
We carry on 'cause there's promise in the mornin' sun
We carry on as the dark surrenders to the dawn
We were born to overcome, we carry on, carry on, we carry on
He stands in the field, cooled by the winds of change
She smiles as her baby moves and it starts to rain
