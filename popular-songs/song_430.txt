Mind on my money, money on my mind
Tryin' to stack paper, countin' every little dime
Down to the penny, holla if ya hear me
I do it for the streets, yeah, I do it for my city
You know you gotta love it, hey hey
You know you gotta love it, hey hey
Stretchin' that paper long, shawty, she wanna roll
Tell me where you wanna go, girl
See don't leave home without it, out it
Money gotta have, gotta have that bank
American Express, all good
But I need that cash in my hand, point blank
Smell, it touch it, rub it
Hug it, love it
Number one subject, keep me rubbin'
G5 on the jet to Dublin
I need that money, man, people say wait
I think we cousins, no you ain't
I don't wanna break you off, I got cash to floss
You can't gank the boss with that lame game
Bank tryna count my change, change
Stretch that paper with my aim
Shoot me a stack to the brain
Rock like number one, a Lac or the Range
Rambo cash, Green Beret fame
All this bread and still I want more
All this cheese, I got the light dough
All these P's, I got the beef flow
Shawty, if you wanna roll, lil' mama let's go
My pockets is swole, get rid of your clothes
Jump up on the Hov, my mind on my dollars
You already know, I got my
Mind on my money, money on my mind
Tryin' to stack paper, countin' every little dime
Down to the penny, holla if ya hear me
I do it for the streets, yeah, I do it for my city

You know you gotta love it, hey hey
Stretchin' that paper long, shawty, she wanna roll
Tell me where you wanna go, girl
Hey, I do it, do it, do it for the streets, streets
Everybody in the ghetto gotta eat
Could've bought me a Bentley GT
But I fell in love with the size of the Maybach seats
Feel like a king when I'm on South Beach
Livin' that dream with this M.O.B
Get, gettin' that cream while I travel overseas
Feelin' them beats with the face of a Queen Elizabeth
A little bit, need all my gwap, I'm lovin' it
Short to the hood, I'm thuggin' it, wifebeater off in public
Got more g's than a government from the projects
But I ain't strugglin', get it poppin', champagne bubblin'
Red carpets, wax so Southernin'
Just bought a resort and I'm on three acres
Go to New York and rock Fuscia gators
[Incomprehensible], six grand to the waiters
Fans support, I get it like the Lakers
Off of the porch where they think about paper
Don't need to fuck when I eat [Incomprehensible]
Passport says I get rent in Malaysia
All over Asia, 'cause my
Mind on my money, money on my mind
Tryin' to stack paper, countin' every little dime
