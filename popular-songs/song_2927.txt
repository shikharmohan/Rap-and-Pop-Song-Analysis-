Feeling one another's joy and sorrow
Dreams today may come true tomorrow
Good friends
Close together like they're of bookends
Feeling what the other one is feeling
They never seem to be without
Those little things to laugh about
Good friends
They have the kind of love
That only deepens
It's something that you rarely find worth keeping
Oh people even new ones come
You're lucky if you find just one
Good friend
And we say goodbye
Knowing what we have will fade away
We'll meet another time, another day
My friend
Good friends
Their paths may never come together again
But in their hearts
They're on a road with no end
Where life will take us who can tell
Guess it's time to say farewell
My friend
Good friends
You never will forget
Your good friends
