I'm not like them but I can pretend
The sun is gone and I have a light
The day is done and I'm having fun
I think I'm dumb
Maybe just happy
I think I'm just happy
I think I'm just happy
I think I'm just happy
My heart is broke and I have some glue
Help me inhale and mend it with you
We'll float around, hang out on clouds
Then we'll come down
Have a hangover
Have a hangover
Have a hangover
Have a hangover
Skin the sun, fall asleep
Wish away, soul is cheap
Lesson learned, wish me luck
Soothe the burn, wake me up
I'm not like them but I can pretend
The sun is gone and I have a light
The day is done and I'm havin' fun
I think I'm dumb
Maybe just happy
I think I'm just happy
I think I'm just happy
I think I'm just happy
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
