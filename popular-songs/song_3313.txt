I went outta my way to do music for you.
I did shit with E40, Scarface, everybody
All your heroes, nigga Yukmouth.
All that shit. Now I'm about to do a It my way,
I don't give a fuck what y'all think about me.
Call me devil worshiper, nigga?
You think that shit's bad?
Listen to this, muthafucka!
[Verse 1:]
How do I describe my pain?
It just rains and it rains
At the same time flame-ah
I am bane, insane in my veins,
No restraints can chain or contain me,
I'm dangerous!
When I gave you my light,
It was wrong, wasn't right,
Ain't no love was in sight when I needed.
So I run with the night
In the songs that I write
If I be violent, then I wont be defeated.
It's jet black in my brain,
'Cause the hatred you gave me
Has turned me to twisted.
You dont like this,
Suck my dick,
All the kids with the sickness
Been waiting for this shit!
I wanna get into the mind of your youngest,
Fill it with fungous,
And grow it 'til it's humongous.
Psycho alumnist, the tip of the tongue slip,
Urgin' you punk bitch,
Eat shit from your dung pit.
[Chorus:]
Everyone are you ready for doom,
Because I've blackened the sun,
And I've bloodied the moon.
I bring gloom when I step in the room,
With the fumes of a tomb,
I consume all the light in the day.
Everyone are you ready for doom,
Because I've blackened the sun,
And I've bloodied the moon.
I bring gloom when I step in the room,
With the fumes of a tomb.
Flowers bloom when Im taken away
[Verse 2:]
I've got this cloud inside that's consuming my mind,
All the brown in my eyes are disolving,
Into the whites of my eyes now the night will arise
And I'm hype cause the beast is evolving
Step into my dreams, lot of bleeding and seaman and green rotted demons
And they feed thier seeds collard greens filled with feces and cheese pieces of human cerebrum this evening (stay away)
Cause everything I touch turns to mold (If you want me)
Everything I fuck, Striaght explodes
(Are we there yet)
(Are you scared yet)
(Look at the pussy in your pants, wanna share that)
(Let me in Imma rip it then Imma tear that)
(I'm tryin' to eat it, bitch where the mothafuckin hair at?)
[Chorus:]
Everyone are you ready for doom,
Because I've blackened the sun,
And I've bloodied the moon.
I bring gloom when I step in the room,
With the fumes of a tomb,
I consume all the light in the day.
Everyone are you ready for doom,
Because I've blackened the sun,
And I've bloodied the moon.
I bring gloom when I step in the room,
With the fumes of a tomb.
flowers bloom when Im taken away
[Verse 3:]
Heat Swells, Details, everybody Eat nails, sleep well
Held the gun, I come to attack everyone, you little crumbs all are done Imma
Blacken the sun
All are banish it, damage it, can you manage to vanish cut you like anakin man it, damn
It and it's no panicking.
When I eat your soul, He's North pole, That meaning Imma be more cold
Freeze more souls, 40 below
Piss Lav and cuervo, Plus habanaro, Now chug it
Burn their heads to their toes, I will not spare those, I love it
(This is the result of you)
(Thinking all clear)
(Callin' me wierd)
(Thinkin' I'm a devil so you niggas dont cheer)
(I don't give a fuck what you think of tecca nina this year)
[Chorus:]
Everyone are you ready for doom,
Because I've blackened the sun,
And I've bloodied the moon.
Bring gloom when I step in the room,
With the fumes of a tomb,
I consume all the light in the day.
Everyone are you ready for doom,
Because I've blackened the sun,
And I've bloodied the moon.
Bring gloom when I step in the room,
With the fumes of a tomb.
Flowers bloom when I'm taken away
