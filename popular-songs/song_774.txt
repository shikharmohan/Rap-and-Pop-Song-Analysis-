I wish I knew how it would feel to be free
I wish I could bring all the change holding me
and I wish I could say all the things that I should say
Saying love, saying clear, for the whole world to hear
I wish I could share all the love that's in my heart
Remove all the bars, that keep us apart
And I wish you can know, what it means to be me
When you see and agree that every man should be free
I wish I could give, I'm longing to give
and I wish I could live, like I'm longing to live
and I wish I could do, all the things that I can do
Though I'm way overdue, I'd be starting to move
Well I wish i could be, like a bird in the sky
How sweet it would be if I found I could fly
Well I'd soar to the sun and looked down at the sea
Then I'd sing cause I know
Yes I'd sing cause I know
Sing cause I know
I know I'm free
