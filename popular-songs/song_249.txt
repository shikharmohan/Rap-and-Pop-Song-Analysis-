You know, it's been a while since I felt like this
The last time was high school
But this feelin', I think he's so cute
And I wanna tell him so bad, but I can't
C.R.U.S.H.
Yeah, I got one really bad
This is how he makes me feel
He puts the beat in my heart
Every time I see him thoughts are getting deeper
And I knew from the start, yeah
From a 'Hi" and 'Nice to meet ya', I was blinded by his features
Girl said, "You're gone"
But I say, "La la la la la, la la la la la"
She said, "C you're in love"
But I said, "Nuh uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh uh"
C is for your confidence but I love the cool in you
R is for the rumors they make, I wish that they were true
Oh U put a smile on my face, you're unforgettable
S is for your sexiness, H, I got to have ya
Got a crush on you
I love me some you
A big crush on you
I love me some you
A big crush
He knows the right things to say
I can't help but pay attention to everything he says
He said he has fun with me
It's been a while since he could do this
Tell me, what does it mean?
My girl said, "You're gone"
But I say, "La la la la la, la la la la la"
She said, "C you're in love"
But I said, "Nuh uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh uh"
C is for your confidence but I love the cool in you
R is for the rumors they make, I wish that they were true
Oh, U put a smile on my face, you're unforgettable
S is for your sexiness, H, I got to have ya
I got a crush on you
I love me some you
A big crush on you
I love me some you
A big crush
I can't control how I'm feelin' inside
I'm off the meter
Always on my mind
Been a while since I felt this way
I don't know what to say-ay-ay when I see you
I get the chills when I look in his eyes
He's so beautiful
He's everything and more
Wanna see him every day
Hope that he feels the same-ame-ame
He's a keeper, oh
C is for your confidence but I love the cool in you
R is for the rumors they make, I wish that they were true
Oh, U put a smile on my face, you're unforgettable
S is for your sexiness, H, I got to have ya
Got a crush on you
I love me some you
A big crush on you
I love me some you
