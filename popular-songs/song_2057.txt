[Verse 1]
So I had someone
You had someone
Started off as nothing more than friends
But as time got spent
I started liking spending time with you
More than him
[Pre-Chorus]
And it wasn't what I meant to do
Started thinking about kissing you
Accidently
Accidently
Suddenly out of the blue
Guess you was thinking about it too
Cuz you kissed me
And he saw you 
Damn
Damn
[Chorus]
I might be over my head
A little over my head
But I kind of like it
I kind of like it
This is not what I expected
A little over my head
But I kind of like it
I kind of like it
[Verse 2]
So of course he started acting crazy
Wound up punching you right in the eye
He felt like a man
But I felt bad
So I called you later
To apologize
[Pre-Chorus]
And it wasn't what I meant to do
Started thinking about seeing you
Accidently
Accidently
Suddenly out of the blue
Guess you was thinking about it too
Cuz you came to get me
And he saw you 
Damn
Damn
[Chorus]
I might be over my head
A little over my head
But I kind of like it
I kind of like it
This is not what I expected
A little over my head
But I kind of like it
I kind of like it
[Verse 3]
This is so crazy
Yet so hard
They're fighting over me
In the front yard
I don't know who I should root for
But there's one thing I do know
[Chorus x2]
I might be over my head
A little over my head
But I kind of like it
I kind of like it
This is not what I expected
A little over my head
But I kind of like it
I kind of like it
I might be over my head
A little over my head
But I kind of like it
I kind of like it
This is not what I expected
A little over my head
But I kind of like it
I kind of like it
