Oh, yeah, mmm
I wait on you forever, any day, hand and foot
Your world is my world, yeah
Ain't no way you ever gonna get
Any less than you should
'Cause baby, you smile, I smile, oh
'Cause whenever you smile, I smile
Hey, hey, hey
Your lips, my biggest weakness
Shouldn't have let you know
I'm always gonna do what they say, hey
If you need me, I'll come running from a thousand miles away
When you smile, I smile, oh, whoa
You smile, I smile, hey
Baby, take my open heart and all it offers
'Cause this is as unconditional as it'll ever get
You ain't seen nothing yet
I won't ever hesitate to give you more
'Cause baby, you smile, I smile, whoa
You smile, I smile, hey, hey, hey
You smile, I smile, I smile, I smile, I smile
You smile, I smile, make me smile, baby
Baby, you won't ever want for nothing
You are my ends and my means now
With you there's no in between, I'm all in
'Cause my cards are on the table
And I'm willing and I'm able
But I fold to your wish 'cause it's my command
Hey, hey, hey
You smile, I smile, whoa
You smile, I smile, hey, hey, hey
You smile, I smile, I smile, I smile, I smile
You smile, I smile, oh
You smile, I smile
You smile, I smile
