I stand here thinking of what could have been
What could have been was ruined so badly again
You just dont know how much i care
And now its time for you to see
chorus
whyd you do that? 
why arent you sorry?
how can you go on?
do you know how much it kills me inside to see the fire in your eyes?
how could you?
I dont know what you were thinking
when you said to me
we are through
well
its your loss
your not the boss
of me
chorus
whyd you do that?
why arent you sorry?
how can you go on?
do you know how much it kills me inside to see the fire in your eyes?
how could you?
I cant believe i saw you with her 
the very next day
you bounce back so fast 
its like i got played
do you know how
sad i am 
to see you with her, my best friend
chorus
whyd you do that?
why arent you sorry?
how can you gon on?
do you know how much it kills me inside to see the fire in your eyes?
how could you?
how could you?
tell me
how could you?
