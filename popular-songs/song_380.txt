She found a cowboy
and I hear they settled down somewhere out west
well I guess it's for the best.
Here in Del Rio
nothing seems to change except the weather,
and I cant forget her.
She goes runnin through my mind
like that Rio Grand river winds
through the desert.
And I cant forget her,
no I cant forget her
There's a senorita
who waits just over the border line
for me tonight
and I could hold her
and this tequila could help me love her
but there's still another.
She goes runnin through my mind
like that Rio Grand river winds
through the desert.
And I cant forget her,
no I cant forget her
These endless starry nights
remind me of her eyes,
and this warm prairie breeze
is like her arms wrapped around me.
She goes runnin through my mind
like that Rio Grand river runs
through the desert.
And i cant forget her,
no i cant forget her
She found a cowboy
and I hear they settled down somewhere out west
well I guess its for the best.
But I cant forget her,
no I cant forget her.
