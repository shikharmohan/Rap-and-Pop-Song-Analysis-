How could you be so heartless? Oh
How could you be so heartless? 
You were my sun                      
You were my earth
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no
So you took a chance
And made other plans
I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no
You know why?
Cause in the night, I hear them talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
That's why I said,
Hopped up out the bed
Turn my swag on
Take a look in mirror said "whats up?"
Yeah, I'm gettin money, Ohh, Ohhh
I want the money, money and the cars
Cars and the clothes, the shows, I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful, yeah, said
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
In the night, I hear them talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
You're busted
I don't wanna put the hurt on you
But you better believe me when I tell you that I
Finally got the dirt on you,
You're busted. (Busted!)
Yeah, she's finally gonna see the light
This is how it's gonna be,
When she finds out that I was always right
In the night, I hear them talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless? Oh
How could you be so heartless?
