[Verse 1 - Tech N9ne]
And I was told in school I was a fool and money, I'd never gain none
but I used my flow as a tool, they was cruel
said I'd be no rapper, but I did work and became one
Now it's a cryin shame, I'm buyin thangs and they got debts they got to pay back
I think I know why my teachers would look in my eye and say that...
And why's that?
[Chorus - Big Krizz Kaliko]
Cuz I'm a Blackboy...
Came from nothing, don't mean my life means nothin
Made it out the game through the pain and sufferin
Y'all don't think I see them purses y'all clutchin? (I do)
See I'm a Blackboy...
Scared when you see me, frauds disappear like a genie
Little whiteboys want to be me
but you don't want to go through What I go through...
true definition of a Blackboy
[Verse 2 - Tech N9ne]
It must be the way that my pants sag
or the sparklin diamonds on the watch my left hand has
I know my appearance is looking like I am bad
In your department store all I wanna do is pop a damn tag
Made it honest, that's why the blacks get mad at you
Even foreigners shop and got big graditude
I make more than you, but you got the additude
Like I can't be shoppin at Saks Fifth Avenue
I'm just tryin to buy my baby some creed spring flower
But they don't know that the Tecca Nina cheese means power
So they look at me like none of my breed brings valor
Thats why when you see us in passing we seem sour
Last time I checked, my power shockeras
I was on top of the indy charts and not a slotera
but I'm the author of darkness and I like the opera
So why when I'm at Macbeth they wont treat me more propera?
[Chorus - Big Krizz Kaliko]
Cuz I'm a Blackboy...
Came from nothing, don't mean my life means nothin
Made it out the game through the pain and sufferin
Y'all don't think I see them purses y'all clutchin? (I do)
See I'm a Blackboy...
Scared when you see me, frauds disappear like a genie
Little whiteboys want to be me
but you don't want to go through What I go through...

[Verse 3 - Brother J]
Frontline... shoot, soldiers represent that
Frontline... shoot, Grand Verb, it's the snatch back
Head wrapped in the desert, boombox on the camel back
Escape from the clone lab, fugitives spook black
With finesse in you, its the knowledge from way back
The prophet of the page dont eat right till it all cracks
Blackboy rappin from the pages torn
Street scriptures more classic than the Jimmy Cracked Corn
A spawn of the movement, keep the music movement
So my purpose stays clear and my music stays groovin
I do it for the real, I don't need Jena Six
for me to know America is still on that bullshit
So people think that black are just ball players and singers
That massa complex is what fuels the street bangers
and street soldiers to stand up
No choice to get it right, so these Blackboys can finally get they man up
[Chorus - Big Krizz Kaliko]
Cuz I'm a Blackboy...
Came from nothing, don't mean my life means nothin
Made it out the game through the pain and sufferin
Y'all don't think I see them purses y'all clutchin? (I do)
See I'm a Blackboy...
Scared when you see me, frauds disappear like a genie
Little whiteboys want to be me
but you don't want to go through What I go through...

[Verse 4 - Ice Cube]
I'm a Blackboy and always gettin underestimated
But when I move next door, I know you hate it
You had my whole family investigated
and when they didn't find no crack, you said I ate it
Uh-uh, a motherfucker just elevated
over ghetto life that was designated
You see this Blackboy, you know heaven made it
I don't want to go if I got to integrate it
You know pellot boy, be happy you made it
Just take what you got, and stop complainin
Ok, weather man will stop the rainin
on my people head, and start explainin
what your people said, believe in the bible
but you still act barbaric and psycho
My name is Ice Cube, bitch, it ain't Michael
I'll never bleach my own skin just to be like you
[Chorus - Big Krizz Kaliko]
Cuz I'm a Blackboy...
Came from nothing, don't mean my life means nothin
Made it out the game through the pain and sufferin
Y'all don't think I see them purses y'all clutchin? (I do)
See I'm a Blackboy...
Scared when you see me, frauds disappear like a genie
Little whiteboys want to be me
but you don't want to go through What I go through...
