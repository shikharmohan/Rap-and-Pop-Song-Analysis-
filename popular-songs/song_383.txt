Country roads, old theater marquee signs
Parkin' lots and billboards flyin' by
Spanish moss, little hick town-squares
Wild roses on a river bank
Girl, it's almost like you're there
Oh, every mile, a memory
Every song, another scene
From some old movie
Goin' back in time, you and me
Every day, a page turned down
Every night, a lonesome sound
Like a freight train
Rollin' through my dreams
Every mile, a memory
Red sun down, out across the western sky
Takes me back to the fire in your eyes
Texas stars in a purple night
Not seein' 'em with you, baby
Oh, they never do look right, no
Every mile, a memory
Every song, another scene
From some old movie
Goin' back in time, you and me
Every day, a page turned down
Every night, a lonesome sound
Like a freight train
Rollin' through my dreams
Every mile, a memory
Funny how no matter where I run
'Round every bend, I only see
Just how far I haven't come
Every mile, a memory
Every song, another scene
From some old movie
Goin' back in time
Every day, a page turned down
Every night, a lonesome sound
Like a freight train
Rollin' through my dreams
Every mile, a memory
Every mile, a memory
Every mile, a memory
