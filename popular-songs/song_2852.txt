Three o' clock in the morning
When the telephone started ringing
I had a feeling it would be you
I didn't wanna take it but I let my imagination
Think of some kinda trouble you got into
And I just had to answer
And you had to stop crying
And I, I tried to fight it
But I thought if I didn't listen to you
That I wouldn't be much of a friend
I let you come over and cry on my shoulder
The hundredth time over again
And all those old emotions came raining out of the blue
Just when I thought I'd stopped loving you
You've got a way of knowing when I'm on the edge of giving in
And how to use those beautiful eyes
So if one day your asking me if I ever thought that
Maybe we oughta give it one more try
And I just had to answer
And you, you had to start smiling
And I thought about lying
But I thought if I wasn't honest with you
That I wouldn't be much of a friend
I let you come over and cry on my shoulder
The hundredth time over again
And all those old emotions came raining out of the blue
Just when I thought I'd stopped loving you
Oh, I hate you for making me crazy
So why is it I, I keep on taking you back, baby?
But I thought if I didn't listen to you
Then I wouldn't be much of a friend
I let you come over and cry on my shoulder
The hundredth time over again
And all those old emotions came raining out of the blue
Just when I thought I'd stopped loving you
Just when I thought I'd stopped loving you
You take two steps down the highway
But you come running back
What am I supposed to do?
What am I supposed to do?
What am I supposed to do with that?
Wrapping my arms around you
Yeah, yeah
