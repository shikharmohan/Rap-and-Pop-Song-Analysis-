I candy-coat and cover everything 
but I'm still hiding underneath 
It's been a long time, 
It's been a long time 
A thousand faces looking up at me 
hands all pointing to the ceiling 
Oh what a feeling 
I've got friends in highly low places 
I'm standing on post, and I'm posted up
cant afford to lose them 
I've got friends and highly low places 
I'll go inside when I wanna party 
Grab a girl and dance (don't touch me) 
Whoa oh Whoa oh Whoa oh, 
Why do I put myself in these situations 
Whoa oh Whoa oh Whoa oh, 
I keep pushing myself even though 
I can't take it at all, whoa 
Girl, who taught you how to move like that? 
at this pace you're at you're at you're going way too fast 
I, I saw you from across the room 
It's me vs. every guy 
It's your choice, you choose 
I've got friends in highly low places 
it's been a long time it's been a long time 
and maybe baby you can rise above the rest to meet me 
Whoa oh Whoa oh Whoa oh, 
Why do I put myself in these situations 
Whoa Whoa oh Whoa oh, 
I keep pushing myself even though 
I can't take it at all 
Whoa oh Whoa oh Whoa oh, 
Why do I put myself in these situations 
Whoa oh Whoa oh Whoa oh, 
I keep pushing myself even though 
I can't take it at all, 
You're worth, 
losing my self esteem 
Your clever words mean 
nothing more to me than 
than a line i heard in a movie 
You're worth, 
losing my losing my losing my self esteem 
You're not worth, 
putting myself in these situations 
Whoa oh Whoa oh Whoa oh, 
Why do I put myself in these situations 
Whoa oh Whoa oh Whoa oh, 
I keep pushing myself even though 
I can't take it at all 
Whoa oh Whoa oh Whoa oh, 
Why do I put myself in these situations 
Whoa oh Whoa oh Whoa oh, 
I keep pushing myself even though 
I can't take it at all
