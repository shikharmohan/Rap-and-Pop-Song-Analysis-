Hey lonely lady with the big brown eyes,
I'm thinking your sadder then you realize.
I can make you smile and feel a little more related,
We just really clicked,
Would it be so wrong if we just dated...?
Let us just go-o-o-o.
Jump on my skateboard, eat some cake along the way.
l do a-a-a-all
Your favorite stuff, right of the cuff, cause were spontaneous.
Lets hop a bus to shop.
We'll check out Filene's.
And get chunky jewellery at Chico's.
I'll buy you a panini and some spanx to make you teeny.
Lonely lady with the big brown eyes.
MOTHERLOAD
You've got the motherload,
You've got the stuff I like.
Everytime I'm with you babe,
I just get syched.
Like bling in your mouth,
But its just old fillings.
And dry skin on your hands,
And you're just so cracked.
Like (?)
We don't want no people seeing
Sittin' on your bed with your jacked up back.
"Hey girl. I wanna watch you do your pilates. But lets skip the hard part. Cause baby."
You've got the motherload.
LIKE THAT
Put me in a outfit from the GAP like that.
One that matches with the jacket and the cap like that.
Then slap me in the stroller with the bounce like that.
With the bottle full of milk that's 40 ounce like that.
I'm your b-baby lady.
Tina - I wanna push you in the buggy.
I'm your b-baby lady,
I wanna hold you like a snuggie.
You're my baby, lady.
Tina - And I'm your lady, baby.
It's time to roll,
Let's go to the park.
