Ayy ayy ayyy ayyy ayyy ayyy
She say she wanna get up, and play the game like me
Wanna spend some vital time, try to keep it low key.
And wanna get up, so we can stay up all night, 
She fell in love with my ride
She textin me like Jeremih I wanna chill I wanna ride
She lucky I cant deny, she loved to be so mezmorized
