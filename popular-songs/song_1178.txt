I know it's gonna take some time
For you to trust this love of mine
I know he broke your heart in two
You've been betrayed and you're afraid
That I will do the same to you
But you'll be safe here in my arms, forever and a day
And though you don't believe me now, I'll never walk away
And you, you know that I'll be there
When tomorrow comes, you're the only one
I know you've heard this all before
(You're the only one)
But you're the one that I adore
(You're the only one)
You make me shine just like the sun
(You're the only one)
And you bring this heart of mine undone
(You're the only one)
Every lie you've ever heard
You can believe my every word
Whatever Heaven holds in store
Through good and bad I'll be your man
I'll stand beside you through it all
You'll be safe here in my arms, forever and a day
And though you don't believe me now, I'll never walk away
And you, you know that I'll be there
When tomorrow comes, you're the only one
I know you've heard this all before
(You're the only one)
But you're the one the I adore
(You're the only one)
You make me shine just like the sun
(You're the only one)
And you bring this heart of mine undone
(You're the only one)
I know you've heard this all before
(You're the only one)
But you're the one the I adore
(You're the only one)
You make me shine just like the sun
(You're the only one)
And you bring this heart of mine undone
You're the only one
You're the only one
You make me shine just like the sun
  (You're the only one)
Yes, you do
You're the only one
