The rumors are true, I deleted my twitter.
Can you believe
I got, got 2 million
Then I said adios
I had to say goodbye
and this little rap is to tell my fans why.
No it wasn't because my friend told me to
Y'all know very well what you say I don't do
And the reasons are simple I started tweeting about pimples
I stopped living for moments and started living for people
Yeah you write what you're doing but who really cares
If I'm playing with Noah or just doing my hair
Everything that I type and everything that I do
All those lame gossip sites take it and they make it news
I want my private life private, I'm done trying to please
I aint living for tabloids, no I'm living for me.
No more emo quotes and big fued with Demi
Yeah I'm done with all that and the truth is I'm too busy
Yeah I gotta admit I miss Dane Cooks tweets and I really like looking at Katy Perry and Britney.
I might have some withdraws I was a little obsessed but I'm peacing out and I'm leaving with this
Goodbye
