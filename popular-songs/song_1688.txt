I come home in the morning light
My mother says, "When you gonna live your life right?"
Oh, mother dear, we're not the fortunate ones
And girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls, just wanna have fun
The phone rings in the middle of the night
My father yells, "What you gonna do with your life?"
Oh, daddy dear, you know you're still number one
And girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls, just wanna have
That's all they really want, is some fun
When the working day is done
Oh girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have fun
Girls, they wanna
They wanna have fun
Girls, they wanna have
Some boys take a beautiful girl
And hide her away from the rest of the world
I wanna be the one to walk in the sun
Oh girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have
That's all they really want, is some fun
When the working day is done
Oh girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have fun
Girls, they wanna
They wanna have fun
Girls, they wanna have
They just wanna
They just want
They just wanna
They just want
That's all they really want, some fun
When the working day is done
Oh girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have fun
Girls, they wanna
They wanna have fun
Girls, they wanna have
When the working, when the working
When the working day is done
Oh, when the working day is done
Oh girls, they wanna have fun
They wanna have fun
Girls, they wanna have fun
Girls, they wanna have
Girls, the wanna have fun
