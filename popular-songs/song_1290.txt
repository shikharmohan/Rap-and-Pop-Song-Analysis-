What you see is not what you get
With you there's just no measurement
No way to tell what's real from what isn't there
You're eyes they sparkle that's all changed
Into lies that dropped like acid rain
You washed away the best of me, you don't care
You know you did it I'm gone
To find someone to live for in this world
There's no light at the end of the tunnel tonight
Just a bridge that I gotta burn
You were wrong
If you think you could walk right through my door
That is just so you coming back when I finally moved on
I'm already gone
Sometimes shattered never opened
Nothing matters when you're broken
That was me whenever I was with you
Always ending, always over
Back and forth, up and down like a roller coaster
I am breaking that habit today
You know you did it I'm gone
To find someone to live for in this world
There's no light at the end of the tunnel tonight
Just a bridge that I gotta burn
You were wrong
If you think you could walk right through my door
That is just so you coming back when I finally moved on
I'm already gone
There is nothing you can say sorry doesn't cut it babe
Take the heat and walk away 'cause I'm gone
Doesn't matter what you do it's what you did that's hurting you
All I needed was the truth now I'm gone
What you see is not what you get
What you see is not what you get
You know you did it I'm gone
To find someone to live for in this world
There's no light at the end of the tunnel tonight
Just a bridge that I gotta burn
You were wrong
If you think you could walk right through my door
That is just so you coming back when I finally moved on
I'm already gone, I'm already gone, I'm already gone, gone, gone
Already gone I'm gone
