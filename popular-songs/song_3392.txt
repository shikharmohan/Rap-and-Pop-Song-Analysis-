What is it gonna take to show my true emotions
The one that's still holding on my chest
How can I describe your sensations
That draws me close to you everyday
That leaves my body down to seductions
I just can't explain what your body does to me
For it'd take a millions years to figure it out
Cause baby you're irresistible
You're body's beyond any man's desire
It keeps me coming back for more
Though sometimes it's hard to get
I find myself in a hot burning fire
An' we haven't met our parents yet
God must have reached up to the sky
And tore out a star and into your eyes
Cause baby you're irresistible
They're a million things in my mind
We could have a candled up dinner
Beneath the sky and spare the time
But every night, It gets fired up
An babe that's why I worship you
While walking on the ground
Or flying above all the earth in dreams
I knew this was true all along
Someday, sometimes we'll promise
You'll always warm me when I lay beside you
Cause babe, you're irresistible
You're body's beyond any man's desire
It keeps me coming back for more
Though sometimes it's hard to get
I find myself in a hot burning fire
An' we haven't said our vows yet
God must have reached up to the sky
And tore out a star and into your eyes
Cause baby you're irresistible
