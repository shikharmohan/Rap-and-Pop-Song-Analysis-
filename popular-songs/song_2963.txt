Three o'clock in the mornin' and it looks
Like it's gonna be another sleepless night
I've been listening to your dreams
And gettin' very low, wonderin' what I can do
Maybe I'm bein' foolish 'cause I haven't heard you
Mention anybody's name at all, how I wish I could be sure it's me
That turns you on each time you close your eyes
I've heard it said that dreamers never lie
You've been talkin' in you sleep, sleeping in your dreams
With some sweet lover, holdin' on so tight
Lovin' her the way you used to love me
Talkin' in your sleep with love in on your mind
Maybe I'm bein' foolish 'cause I haven't heard you
Mention anybody's name at all, how I wish I could be sure it's me
That turns you on each time you close your eyes
I've heard it said that dreamers never lie
'Cause you've been talkin' in you sleep, sleeping in your dreams
With some sweet lover, holdin' on so tight
Lovin' her the way you used to love me
Talkin' in your sleep with love in on your mind
You've been talkin' in you sleep, sleeping in your dreams
With some sweet lover, holdin' on so tight
Lovin' her the way you used to love me
Talkin' in your sleep with love in on your mind
You've been talkin' in you sleep
