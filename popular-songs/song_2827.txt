Congratulations, you made a fool out of me
I hope you're happy, so now just let me be
I might be slow to lovers but I catch on eventually
Congratulations, you made a fool out of me
Anticipation, you kept me waiting in line
Your situation did not allow you time
So I'd sit home alone, pretending someday you'd be mine
Congratulations, you made a fool of me this time
Then he played it smart
You stole my heart and tore my world apart
Guess you always knew I'd be the perfect fool
Congratulations baby, you win, I lose
Imagination, the way I dreamed it could be
Ooh, the sweetest sensation of how you made love to me
But now the vision's gone, it's time to face reality
Congratulations, you made a fool out of me
Congratulations, you made a fool out of me
