Without me, maybe you'd find somebody else
A little wiser with a lot more wealth
And without you it's true I'd be free
To go chasing all my dreams without any strings
But I wouldn't want it any other way
Having you to come home to at the end of everyday
Your tender touch puts a smile back on my face
Wouldn't want it any other way
Hard times may never let up on us
And maybe all we'll ever have will barely be enough
And, babe, you know, how cold the wind can blow
Love has never let us down when we needed it the most
And I wouldn't want it any other way
Having you to come home to at the end of everyday
Your tender touch puts a smile back on my face
Wouldn't want it any other way
Your tender touch puts a smile back on my face
Wouldn't want it any other way
Wouldn't want it any other way
Any other way, oh, girl
You know I love you more each day
Any other way, oh
