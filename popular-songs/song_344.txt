Designer names and diamond rings are just some of the finer things
I thought it took to keep her satisfied
But a bank account and credit cards, a circle drive through an acre yard
Couldn't feel that lonesome feeling, that she held inside
I bought her fancy clothes, for all occasions
And that new car so she could go just any old where she pleased
I bought the golden band she wore on the hand that closed the door
And I bought the shoes that just walked out on me
Leaving early and stayin' out late, I thought for sure her love would wait
Until the day that I could find the time
But all the things that she expected, were all the things that I neglected
For what she wanted from me would not have cost a dime
I bought her fancy clothes, for all occasions
And that new car so she could go just any old where she pleased
I bought the golden band she wore on the hand that closed the door
And I bought the shoes that just walked out on me
I bought the golden band she wore, on the hand that closed the door
And I bought the shoes that just walked out on me
Yes I bought the shoes that just walked out on me
