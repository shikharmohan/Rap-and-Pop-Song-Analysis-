[Big Sean Verse 1]
Let me tell you about a bad ass chick everybody wanna grab her
tryna climb on that looking for a ladder
n-ggas wanna stab her, dag her, dag it
everybody want it
aint too many had it
beauty and brains, went to all the classes
graduated too even went and got a masters
bad ass chick probably could have been an actress
so what she do?
she want to be an actress
moved to Manhatton, sh-t got real
took acting classes with Denzel
leading lady like Hillary grabbing big Bills
commercial money baby, ten thousand and a mill
yeah, plus she had a baby boy
and the n-gga she was with she couldnÃÂ¢€t love more
still want more, sh-t she on a roll
move to hollywood she could probably get a role
and she did, but realised the n-gga wasnÃÂ¢€t sh-t
addicted to the broads and on top of this she pregnant
with another boy
honestly thought abort but still had the boy
lets name him Sean
honestly probably after Connery
one of her favourite actors but acting aint promising
ay yo I know there was certain things that was meant for you
and thats why IÃÂ¢€m giving you
[Chorus - Kanye West In Brackets]

for your baby boy

whatever you want)
