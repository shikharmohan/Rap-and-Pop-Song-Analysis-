Oh, I'm feelin' so fine and you're lookin' so good
And I'd like to get together, oh Lord, I wish we could
But there's someone at home who's depending on me
And though he'd never know it if I set my passions free
But I don't think love ought to be that way
No I don't think love ought to be that way
I could tell him a lie and I know that I'd get by
But I don't think love ought to be that way
You say a precious moment is all that it would be
That I'd forget about you and you'd forget me
Oh I love what you're saying it's tempting me so
And though I love to hear it there's no way that I'll let go
'Cause I don't think love ought to be that way
No I don't think love ought to be that way
I could tell him a lie and I know that I'd get by
But I don't think love ought to be that way
No I don't think love ought to be that way
I don't think love ought to be that way
I could tell him a lie and I know that I'd get by
But I don't think love ought to be that way
No I don't think love ought to be that way
No I don't think love ought to be that way
I could tell him a lie and I know that I'd get by
But I don't think love ought to be that way
I don't think love ought to be that way
I don't think love ought to be that way
I could tell him a lie and I know that I'd get by
But I don't think love ought to be that way
