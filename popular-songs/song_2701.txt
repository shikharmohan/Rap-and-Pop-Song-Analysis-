My little boy was a wise man this year
His Christmas play was something I couldn't miss
Between the shopping and my job I barely got there
My faith was worn from stress and strain
Until those little
Angels sang
(Hallelujah)
To the King
(People rejoice)
He brought peace and joy to all the world
When he came
And the Angels sang
(Hallelujah)
And they sang
(People rejoice)
And as I watched those innocent children
I felt the greatness of that holy night
And for a moment I was right there with those wise men
So overwhelmed with love and light
I had to cry when the
Angels sang
(Hallelujah)
To the King
(People rejoice)
He brought peace and joy to all the world
When he came
And the Angels sang
(Hallelujah)
And they sang
(People rejoice)
And the Angels sang
(Hallelujah)
To the King
(People rejoice)
He brought peace and joy to all the world
When he came
And the Angels sang
(Hallelujah)
To the King
(People rejoice)
He brought peace and joy to all the world
When he came
And the Angels sang
(Hallelujah)
And they sang
(People rejoice)
(Hallelujah)
To the King
(People rejoice)
(Hallelujah)
(People rejoice)
(Hallelujah)
(People rejoice)
(Hallelujah)
