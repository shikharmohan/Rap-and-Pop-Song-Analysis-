Oh ain't life wonderful
When everything is right
But sometimes wonderful
Can fall apart sometimes
When your troubles knock you down
Pick yourself up off the ground
And walk on, walk on
Nothing ever stays wrong that long
Walk on
Oh don't, don't just stand there in the storm
Walk toward the light till you find the sun
You'll be better off in the long run
And walk on
Oh it's a heartache when love comes to an end
But even though your heart breaks
You know it's gonna mend
Keep the faith right through goodbye
Don't you ever break your stride
And walk on, oh walk on
Nothing ever stays wrong that long
Walk on, walk on
Don't just stand there in the storm
Walk toward the light till you find the sun
And you'll be better off in the long run
Walk on
Oh walk on, oh walk on
Nothing ever stays wrong that long
Walk on, oh walk on
Don't just stand there in the storm
Walk toward the light till you find the sun
And you'll be better off in the long run
Walk on, walk on
Walk on oh walk on
Walk on, oh walk on
