Who, oh, who's gonna love you like I do?
Who, oh, who you gonna find to do the things that I do?
Before you say goodbye
You better think about it one more time
Tell me who, oh, who ever held you any tighter?
Who, oh, who you gonna find that can take you any higher
Before you put me down
Better stop and look around
And tell me, who?
Who who who who?
You might just find a match
That can kindle your desires
But what good is just one candle
When what you need is fires
Tell me who?
Who who who who?
Who who who who?
Who who who who?
Before I let you go
One thing I've got to know
Tell me who, oh who's gonna love you like I do?
Who who who who?
Oh, who you gonna find that can do the things that I do?
Who who who who?
Oh, who ever held you any tighter?
Who who who who?
Oh, who you gonna find that can take you any higher?
Who who who who?
