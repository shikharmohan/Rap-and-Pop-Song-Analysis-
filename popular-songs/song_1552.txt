I just got off of work at 5
Drivin' that old van I drive
Overalls and dirty boots
But Uncle Bill needed a funeral suit
So when I walked in that fancy store
Well they looked at me like I was poor
But a wad of hundred dollar bills caused a stir
It went from "don't take checks" to "right away, yes sir!"
Upper middle class white trash
My pockets can't hold all my cash
'Cause one day I stopped to pee
Got some gas and won the lottery
Now I'm investin' in my neighborhood
My friends and family, they're all livin' pretty good!
My trailer park's full of Cadillacs
And upper middle class white trash
Well I got my homeboy Chris a brand new shop
For all those cars on cinder blocks
And cousin Charlie, well he thinks it's cool
To keep a large mouth bass in his new swimmin' pool
I had a birthday party for mama last night
In her ninety and a half foot triple-wide
You ain't seen nothin' if you ain't seen
NASCAR on a sixty inch plasma screen
Upper middle class white trash
My pockets can't hold all my cash
'Cause one day I stopped to pee
Got some gas and won the lottery
Now I'm investin' in my neighborhood
My friends and family, they're all livin' pretty good!
My trailer park's full of Cadillacs
And upper middle class white trash
We're buyin' chicken wings by the bucket!
We can't eat 'em all, we just say 'chuck it'
All the Miller Light you can handle
A hundred and fifty-seven movie channels
Upper middle class white trash
Our pockets can't hold all our cash
'Cause one day I just had to pee
Got some gas and won the lottery
Now I'm investin' in my neighborhood
My friends and family, they're all livin' pretty dag gum good!
My trailer park's full of Cadillacs
And upper middle class white trash
So pop a top, sit back and relax
All you upper middle class white trash
Ha ha ha
