Guess you heard I'm doin' well
Struck it rich to hear some folks tell
But I'm still the same old me
Down on easy street
You give your all to find that road
And you lose touch with some people as you go
Promises are hard to keep
Down on easy street
But when I lay down, and you're not there
Girl, I wish I was anywhere
But in this world where the telephone is all I touch
When I'm alone and no one ever really knows
The man inside of me
And up here in this lonely room just a-sippin' wine
And a-missin' you girl I've got everything
But what I need
That's why I'm down
Down on easy street
Someone told me you moved on
Well who could blame you, with me so off and gone
But do you ever think of me
Down on easy street?
If you're out this way, some week, some year
Girl, you'll still find me waitin' here
And in this world where the telephone is all I touch
When I'm alone and no one ever really knows
The man inside of me
And up here in this lonely room just a-sippin' wine
And a-missin' you girl I've got everything
But what I need
That's why I'm down
Down on easy street
In this world where the telephone is all I touch
When I'm alone and no one ever really knows
The man inside of me
And up here in this lonely room just a-sippin' wine
And a-missin' you girl I've got everything
But what I need
That's why I'm down
Down on easy street
Down on easy street
Down on easy street
Yes you heard I'm doin' well
