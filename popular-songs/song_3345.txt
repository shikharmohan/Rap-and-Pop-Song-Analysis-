'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
And I can't keep picturing you with him
And it hurts so bad, yeah
'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
I replay it over and over again
And I can't take it, yeah, I can't shake it, no
I can't wait to see you
'Want to see if you still got that look in your eyes
That one you had for me before we said our goodbyes
And it's a shame that we got to spend our time
Being mad about the same things
Over and over again
About the same things
Over and over again
Ohh, but I think she's leaving
Ooh man, she's leaving
I don't know what else to do
(I can't go on not loving you)
'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
And I can't keep picturing you with him
And it hurts so bad, yeah
'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
I replay it over and over again, yeah
And I can't take it, yeah, I can't shake it, no
I remember the day you left
I remember the last breath you took right in front of me
When you said that you would leave
(Over and over again)
Ohh, but I see clearly now
And this choice I made keeps playing in my head
Over and over again
Playing my head
Over and over again
Ohh, I think she's leaving
Ooh man, she's leaving
I don't know what else to do
(I can't go on not loving you)
'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
And I can't keep picturing you with him
And it hurts so bad, yeah
'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
I replay it over and over again
And I can't take it, I can't shake it, no
Now that I've realized that I'm going down
From all this pain you've put me through
Every time I close my eyes, I lock it down, oh
I can't go on not loving you
'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
And I can't keep picturing you with him
And it hurts so bad, yeah
'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
I replay it over and over again
And I can't take it, I can't shake it
'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
And I can't keep picturing you with him
And it hurts so bad, yeah
'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
I replay it over and over again
And I can't take it, I can't shake it, no
Over and over again
Over and over again
'Cause it's all in my head
