Oh do you remember?
When the family was everything?
Oh do you remember?
It was so long ago and so much has changed
I wanna go back
Wanna go back to those simple days
I wanna go back
But now we've grown and gone our separate ways
Times is hard and things are a-changin'
I pray to God that we can remain the same
All I'm trying to say is our love don't have to change
No, it don't have to change
Do you remember?
Back at Grannie's house on Christmas Day?
Help me sing, do you remember?
How we'd gather 'round and sing all day?
I wanna go back
To playing basketball and football games
I wanna go back
To yesterday but it's not the same
Times is hard and things are a-changin'
I pray to God that we can remain the same
All I'm trying to say is our love don't have to change
No, it don't have to change
Times is hard and things are a-changin'
So I pray to God that we can remain the same
All I'm trying to say is our love don't have to change
No, it don't have to change
