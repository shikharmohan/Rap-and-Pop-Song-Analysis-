You're such a pretty little thing
I wanna put you a wedding ring on your finger
And baby can't you see that we were meant to be together
Yeah the joinin' of our hearts is written in the stars
We've got a love made in Heaven
So baby take my hand, I wanna be your man forever
Well I can't think of anyone else it's true
All day long there's no one on my mind but you
And I have loved you since you were a little girl
You mean everything to me and you're all I'll ever need in this world
Now, you're such a pretty little thing
I wanna put you a wedding ring on your finger
And baby can't you see that we were meant to be together
Yeah the joinin' of our hearts is written in the stars
We got a love made in Heaven
Baby take my hand, I wanna be your man forever, oh yeah
Alright now, yeah, yeah
Every time I look into your eyes I see
The one I want beside me for eternity
And you could make me the happiest man alive
By settin' up a date and takin' my name for life
Ah you're such a pretty little thing
I wanna put you a wedding ring on your finger
And baby can't you see that we were meant to be together
Yeah the joinin' of our hearts is written in the stars
We got a love made in Heaven
So baby take my hand, I wanna be your man forever
You're such a pretty little thing
I wanna put you a wedding ring on your finger
Baby can't you see that we were meant to be together
Yeah the joinin' of our hearts is written in the stars
We got a love made in heaven
So baby take my hand, I wanna be your man forever
Yeah baby take my hand, I wanna be your man forever, oh yeah
