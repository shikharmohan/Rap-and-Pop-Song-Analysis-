Mmm, ooo
Baby, since the day you came into my life
You made me realize that we were born to fly
You showed me everyday new possibilities
You proved my fantasies, what love could really be
Let's go to a place only lovers go
To a spot that we've never known
To the top of a cloud we're floating away
Ooh, this feels so crazy, how this love is blazing
Baby, we're so high, walking on cloud nine
  (You got me up so high)
So high
  (My shoes are scraping the sky)
So high
  (You got me up so high)
Oh
(My shoes are scraping the sky)
Maybe later we could go up to the moon
Or sail among the stars before the night is through
And when morning comes we'll see the sun is not so far
And we can't get much closer to God than where we are
We'll go to a place only lovers go
To a spot that we've never known
To the top of the clouds we're floating way, yeah
Ooh, this feels so crazy, oh, this love is blazing
And baby, we're so high, walking on cloud nine
  (You got me up so high)
So high
  (My shoes are scraping the sky)
So high
  (You got me up so high)
Oh, yeah
  (My shoes are scraping the sky)
Ooh, yeah
Ooh ohh
Hey
Ooh, this feels so crazy, how this love is blazing
Baby, we're so high, walking on cloud nine
You got me up so high
You got me up so high
You got me up so high
My shoes are scraping the sky
You got me up so high
You got me up so high
You got me up so high
My shoes are scraping the sky
Ooh ooh, yeah
Mmm yeah, yeah
This is how love's supposed to be, yeah
This is how, this is how love's supposed to be, yeah
Let's go to the moon baby, ooh
Let's go to the moon baby, yeah
Let's go, go, let's go to the moon, baby
So high
