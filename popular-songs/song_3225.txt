[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
And I aint tryna be no husband
I'm just tryin' to get your lovin'
Ain't no time for you to be stubborn
Aey!
And I ain't that kind that just be hoverin'
Over no blind bianc that's sufferin'
In the mind she got a lot of flusterin'
Listen I got this thang
I wanna do bang all over you
Strange what Imma do
I wanna put you in the lane that gets we pain
I really wanna put you in the car
get you at the house
?
? throw you on the couch
?
take it out
[Chorus x2: Tech N9ne]
Take it off
Here's my shirt baby
Let me take it off ya (Get if off)
Here's my skirt baby
Let me take it off ya (Take if off)
Put in work baby
I'm about ta off ya (Get if off)
Do me, do me
Give it to me and I got cha (Take if off)
[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
You lookin' like you really need somebody to come please ya buddy
Then come ?plead ya naughty?
Hey!
I'm tellin' you you need to seize my Johnny
It won't tease ya nanny
Escuse me so irisy
I'm diggin' ya yes I wanna get in ya dress
The N9ne lickin' ya breast then I'm fixin' ta
Hit it to the people that thinkin' I had a cook out
If you got a pretty punani its gettin took out
Take it to the crib then I rip ya off
A good guy with the jugular so baby look out
OH
I'm lookin for a ho e-o-e-o
If she wanna know me low she go
Baby gotta blow me slowly though
Hit it real slow for a minute then stepped up the pump
Hit it from the back and I pepped up the rump
But I beat it of a nigga that messed up the cunt
So I ain't gonna smell it if that's what you want
How many really wanna know about Tech
Gotta give a women that psycho sex
If she got a best friend we all are sexin' if she first then I go next
Here I come baby to break it off
When I'm done they gotta tape it off
Never defeated the better lover the heated
If Imma give her the business then Imma tell the baby
[Chorus x2: Tech N9ne]
Take it off
Here's my shirt baby
Let me take it off ya (Get if off)
Here's my skirt baby
Let me take it off ya (Take if off)
Put in work baby
I'm about ta off ya (Get if off)
Do me, do me
Give it to me and I got cha (Take if off)
