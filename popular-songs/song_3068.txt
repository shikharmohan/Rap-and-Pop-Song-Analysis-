We talk on the phone every night
I'm losin' sleep
And when we hang up, you're in my dreams
You're everywhere I go, or so it seems
And when I get around you I say stupid things
And things I don't mean
I'm falling head first over you (over you)
I'm fallin' head first over you
You're fillin' me up
Just like a balloon
I'm slippin and i'm falling headfirst
I'm fallin' for you, I'm fallin' for you
Boy give me a sign, show me the light
Cause i'mma hangin on to every word you say
And my hair colour's blonde, is that okay?
Cause I'm getting the feeling that I just can change,
Do you feel the same way?
I'm falling head first over you (over you)
I'm fallin' head first over you
You're fillin' me up, 
Just like a balloon
I'm slippin and i'm falling Headfirst
I'm fallin' for you, I'm fallin' for you,with the things that you do, I'm fallin' for you, I'm fallin, I'm fallin, I'm fallin
With the things that you do
(Headfirst, headfirst, headfirst, headfirst, headfirst)
The things that you do!
I'm falling head first over you (over you)
I'm fallin' head first over you
You're fillin' me up
Just like a balloon
I'm slippin and i'm falling baby (headfirst)
I'm falling head first over you (over you)
I'm fallin' head first over you
(You got me feelin)
You're fillin' me up
Just like a balloon'
I'm slippin and i'm falling baby
I'm falling for you, i'm falling for you
I'm fallin for you....
