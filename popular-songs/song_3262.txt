I gets more trips than a little bit
I smoked more dips than a little bit
I'm not that regular when stepping I can't wait till I can fly
Away from my competitor yeah Santana can die
My psychosis hopeless focus notice
My metamorphosis folks is broke and jokeless
Picture me in a syringe inserted in an over exerted
Felon antidote having 'em running eternally across the Helland
Dwamn losing my sanity living up in les miserables
Fuck bitter broads this shit is gonna have us stacking
If there is a God I'mma take the X away from generation
Place it at the end of S.E. for the duration upon the level
Tell the devil to what skip a human I'mma tell him
Behold pale horses like us shame on a nigga
When he's feeling hella down for a ninety-nine killing
Ain't giving a fuck I'm putting Nair in your leave in hair conditioner
Now you Hari Krishna to my listeners in this rhyme
You will find psychotic scriptures saying
It's something disrupting my mind
Tech Nine your mind is fine
There's just not anyone like you
The whole wide world don't matter, no
They can't flow like you
I must make you understand
My thoughts are twisted
(So mixed up)
My thoughts are twisted
(So mixed up)
My thoughts are twisted
(So mixed up)
My thoughts are twisted
(So mixed up)
A, I'm lifted B, I'm twisted C, I'm sick and sadistic
A, B and C somethings I do I just can't stand
Up in my bathroom I sex six women mentally just me and me
Me and my faithful right hand man tie up a Muslim
And shoot him with liquid pork on Ramadan
With force I'll make a Christian read their kids the necronomicon
On Christmas don't trip on this lyrical syphilis
I flip this so the yonks will catch the vapors like menthalyptus
I'll feed a dominatrix patient pain pills
Give Wu haters permanent fang grills
Trick the artist formerly known and give him the same slave deal
I'll lift a couple of Dr. Dre's reels tell 'em to Snoop and No Limit Soldiers
Just so I can see how paid feels hazy shade of decade
Hookers with grave shields where AIDS fills the carcass
Bet a milli on it Tech Nine be the darkest heartless
I spark from the gut so what the fuck
I'm trying to contain the insane, but what
But I get mixed up
(So mixed up)
My thoughts are twisted
(So mixed up)
My thoughts are twisted
(So mixed up)
I try to maintain but I get mixed up
(So mixed up)
Welcome to my asylum it's hectic they call me
Dyslexic Rogue infested more vicious than Cujo
Fraudulent tested the punks arrested got the neck slit exit
I'm twisted I know Hollywood backwards says doowylloh
Force feed me a Sumo for about nine weeks
Playing club Nuevo till he's blue though
Then stuff him in the front seat of a Yugo
Body filled with beef and toaster strudel
Let up the break and watch him race
To the intersection now he's through, though Yastuvo
I slide with a gang of twisted individuals
Somebody better be looking for the criminal tendencies
Never will they get us in the penitentiaries
Killa millimeter Nine rips vinyl
I know mix flow like Korean albino
Wino, once breaded an elephant with a rhino called it the hell if I know
Throw Chucky Mason off in a pit of militant Jews
Banging hella opera the real meaning of helter skelter
When they skin their foreheads watch it go
Am I twisted? Am I twisted? I twisted better keep distance
Mama gonna call the psychiatrist for mental assistance
Tech Nine your mind is fine
There's just not anyone like you
The whole wide world don't matter, no
They can't flow like you
I must make you understand
My thoughts are twisted
(So mixed up)
My thoughts are twisted
(So mixed up)
My thoughts are twisted
(So mixed up)
I try to maintain but I get mixed up
(So mixed up)
