Been on my best behavior,
Time for you to give me my reward,
Come on baby let me get on board,
this plane to ecstacy,
I know it's gonna be worth the wait,
Give me a taste,
Baby I've got something to show you,
Sexually I wanna get to know you,
Just baby just give it to me baby,
[Chorus]
Baby its bout to go down,
I'm about to,
Set it off up in here now,
Really hope you can handle what I'm bout to give you baby,
Girl if you just lay down,
Baby its bout to go down,
I'm about to,
Set it off up in here now,
Really hope you can handle what I'm bout to give you baby,
