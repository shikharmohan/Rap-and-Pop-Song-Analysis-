Ay man, this what the world been waitin' on, dawg
New beginning, my niggas, prince of the rap game you know
Me Bow Weezy, The Ambassador
Omarion, dig dat homeboy
Squeeze the life out of the game, so call me python
Nigga, I transform when they turn them lights on
Mic on, ice on, yeah, I gets my shine on
Mr. Money ain't a thang, Jr. wit' Omarion
And I confess that I'm feelin' myself
I confess that I'm in it the wealth, with money under my belt
So much R 'n' B baby, that my show could be shelved
I'm lost in the flow, I can't be helped
I got a swag that can't be chromed
Got a Benz and a Bentley and a Lac and a Jag on chrome
I'm a boss, watch your mouth, boy
The hood love what I do
Live the life of a hood star, 'cause your boy nice wit' it
Girls line up at the bar, it's 'cause I'm nice wit' it
Forget the price, get it, they talkin' but we live it
They talkin' but we live it, the definition of nice
Live the life of a hood star, 'cause your boy nice wit it
Girls line up at the bar, it's 'cause I'm nice wit it
Forget the price, get it, they talkin' but we live it
They talkin' but we live it, the definition of nice
Look, I can't describe how I feel man
It's like any time I breathe I make a million
Shows we gon' pack 'em out, money come in large amounts
Ball until we fall, nigga, yeah, that's what I'm talkin' 'bout
Screamin' like guns started poppin' in the club
The only thing poppin' is bottles fillin' my cup
Then we step on stage, it's like the Twin Towers was born
Fire in my eyes, ice in my veins, it's on
Ay, the big game is ruthless, Phantom ruthless
Young Bow Weezy definition what the truth is
I'm err where the money be, err where the honeys be
You lookin' at the real shit, other niggas wanna be
Columbus to LA, you lames know just how we get down
Go to any city and we shuttin' down your hometown
We young wit' it, cocky, yeah, we the problem
Dynamic duo but not Batman and Robin
I got a swag that cant be matched
Got a house in the hills and it looks like a car show in the back
I'm a boss, boy
The hood love what I do
Live the life of a hood star, 'cause your boy nice wit' it
Girls line up at the bar, it's 'cause I'm nice wit' it
Forget the price, get it, they talkin' but we live it
They talkin' but we live it, the definition of nice
Live the life of a hood star, 'cause your boy nice wit' it
Girls line up at the bar, it's 'cause I'm nice wit' it
Forget the price, get it, they talkin' but we live it
They talkin' but we live it, the definition of nice

They talkin' but we live it, the definition of nice
I live it man
Live the life of a hood star, 'cause your boy nice wit' it
