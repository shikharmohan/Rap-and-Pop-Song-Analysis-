Jeep tires burn my driveway black,
Got my John deere hat turned back.
Brother says there's gonna be a fight,
Sumter County Friday Night.
One black eye and two teeth later,
Sumter High and the Lakewood gators
Brandy May, Nancy Bean,
Waiting at the Dairy Queen!
Jump in the back, take down the top,
28 minutes to Sparkle Berry Swamp.
Come over here give me a kiss,
Lord don't make it no better than this!
Red dirt roads and big tire toys,
Country girls and redneck boys,
Carolina moon is big and bright,
Sumter County Friday Night!
Fred Johnson just opened up his fields,
Change of plans ain't no big deal.
Hundered fifty cell phones ring,
Everybody's talking about the same thing!
Wedgefield Road south of town,
Go 13 miles then slow it down,
Radar trap, Barney Fife,
Don't hold that brown bag up to high!
Red dirt roads and big tire toys,
Country girls and redneck boys,
Carolina moon is big and bright,
Sumter County Friday Night!
Tailgates down around the fire,
New shotgun can't wait to try her.
Beer can targets in the air,
Duck boots are the thing to wear.
Cow tippin', skinny dipping,
Bring your own 'cause you can't have mine.
Don't start out looking for trouble,
But oh the trouble we can find!
On
Red dirt roads and big tire toys,
Country girls and redneck boys,
Carolina moon is big and bright,
Sumter County Friday Night,
Sumter County Friday Night!
