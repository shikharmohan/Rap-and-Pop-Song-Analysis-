Daddy used to tell me
If I ran too fast I'd fall and hurt myself
But the ice cream man would ring his bell
And I'd get there before anyone else
I'd see a puppy in the window
And I'd run and press my face against the pane
And daddy'd say "Slow down, girl
After all these years I guess nothing has changed"
That little girl I knew ran after you
But she fell this time and broke her heart in two
Hey, that's just like a little girl I knew
Back home there stands an old house
With a picket fence beneath a big oak tree
I can almost see the backyard
And a little girl with freckles, that was me
And there were dreams of toys and storybooks
And, Lord, it seemed I wanted them so bad
Now 20 years have come and gone
And I'm still chasing things that I can't have
That little girl I knew ran after you
But she fell this time and broke her heart in two
Hey, that's just like a little girl I knew
Guess I'm still that little girl
Daddy, I still haven't slowed down yet
