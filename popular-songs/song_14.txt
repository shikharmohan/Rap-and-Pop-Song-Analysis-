I heard
that you're settled down
that you
found a girl
and your
married now
I heard
that your dreams came true
I guess she gave you things
I didnt give to you
oh friend
why you so shy
aint like you to hold back
or hide from the light
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
but I couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it
I hoped you'd see my face and be reminded
that for me
it isn't over
nevermind
I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best
for you too
don't forget me
I beg
I'll remember you still
sometimes it lasts in love
but sometimes it hurts instead
sometimes it lasts in love
but sometimes it hurts instead
yeah
you know how the time flies
only yesterday
it was the time of our lives
we were born and bred
in a summer haze
bound by the surprise
of our glory days
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
but I couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it
I hoped you'd see my face and be reminded
that for me
it isn't over
nevermind
I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best
for you too
don't forget me
I beg
I'll remember you still
sometimes it lasts in love
but sometimes it hurts instead
nothing compares
no worries or cares
regrets and mistakes
and memories made
who would have known
how bittersweet
this would taste
nevermind
I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best
for you too
don't forget me
i beg
I'll remember you still
sometimes it lasts in love
but sometimes it hurts instead
nevermind
I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best
for you too
don't forget me
I beg
I'll remember you still
sometimes it lasts in love
but sometimes it hurts instead
sometimes it lasts in love
but sometimes it hurts instead
