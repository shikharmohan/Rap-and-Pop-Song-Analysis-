I know it's the best I've seen
I never tell you i dont mean a thing
I know its the worst you've felt, you've got every right to keep it to yourself.
Caught in a game of war, traded your heart for a hand better than before
See, I let you down, oh, you pushed me out
I let you win. I let you win
 
Iam dancing alone today
I can hear a waltz
I think it's calling out your name
It's saying I need you soo oh, 
But please dont you say dont you say,
I let you down, but you, you pushed me out and I, I, I, 
I let you win...I let you win...
