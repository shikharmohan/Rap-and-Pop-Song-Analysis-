Becky was a beauty from south Alabama
Her daddy had a heart like a nine pound hammer
Think he even did a little time in the slammer
What was I thinkin'?
She snuck out one night an' met me by the front gate
Her daddy came out a-wavin' that 12-guage
We tore out the drive, he peppered my tailgate
What was I thinkin'?
Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late
'Cause I was thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top
Sittin' right there in the middle by me
An' I was thinkin' 'bout a long kiss
Man, just gotta get goin', where the night might lead
I know what I was feelin'
But what was I thinkin'?
What was I thinkin'?
By the county line, the cops were nippin' on our heels
Pulled off the road an' kicked it in four-wheel
Shut off the lights an' tore through a cornfield
What was I thinkin'?
At the other side, she was hollerin', "Faster"
Took a dirt road, had the radio blastin'
Hit the honky-tonk for a little close dancin'
What was I thinkin'?
Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late
'Cause I was thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top
Sittin' right there in the middle by me
I was thinkin' 'bout a long kiss
Man, just gotta get goin', where the night might lead
I know what I was feelin'
But what was I thinkin'?
What was I thinkin'?
When a mountain of a man with a "Born to kill" tattoo
Tried to cut in, I knocked out his front tooth
We ran outside, hood slidin' like Bo Duke
What was I thinkin'?
I finally got her home at a half past two, later
Daddy's in a long chair sittin' on the driveway
Put it in park as he started my way
What was I thinkin'? Oh, what was I thinkin'?
Oh, what was I thinkin'?
Then she gave a "Come an' get me" grin
An' like a bullet, we were gone again
'Cause I was thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top
Sittin' right there in the middle by me
I was thinkin' 'bout a long kiss
Man, just gotta get goin' where the night might lead
I know what I was feelin'
Yeah I know what was I feelin'
But what was I thinkin'?
What was I thinkin'?
I know what I was feelin'
What was I thinkin'?
Guess I was thinkin' 'bout that tank top
