O holy night the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth
The thrill of hope the weary soul rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn'
Fall on your knees oh, hear the angel voices
O night divine, o holy night when Christ was born
O night divine, o holy night when Christ was born
When Christ was born
Led by the light of faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
So led by light of the star so sweetly gleaming
Here came the wise men from far different lands
A King of kings is born, the world rejoices
In all our trials born to be our friends
Fall on your knees oh, hear the angel voices
O night divine, o holy night when Christ was born
O night divine, o holy night when Christ was born
