Yeah, yeah
Oh it's a love thing
I been working all day long
And I'm ready to come on home to you
All the other guys who roll their eyes
And don't realize it's what I want to do
It's what I want to do
They say I'm wrapped around your finger
But they don't understand
That what we got is more than
Just a diamond on your hand
Baby it's a love thing
Oh baby it's a love thing, yeah
Sure I could hang around and complain about
The way things ought to be
Yeah there's trouble in the world
But you're the girl whose open arms are all I really need
And that's why I come runnin'
To be there by your side
To let 'em call me crazy
But it can't be denied
Baby it's a love thing
Oh baby it's a love thing, yeah
And it's not about the same last name
It's not a thing that can be explained
It's how you make me feel inside
And the way you hold me everynight
It's a love thing
Oh baby, it's a love thing, yeah
Here we go now, it's a love thing
They say I'm wrapped around your finger
But they don't understand
That what we got is more than
Just a diamond on your hand
Baby it's a love thing
Oh baby it's a love thing, yeah, yeah
Come on it's a love thing
Oh baby, it's a love thing
Oh, it's a love thing
Oh sugar, it's a love thing
No it ain't about no diamond ring
It's a love thing
Oh baby it's a love thing
It's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love thing
