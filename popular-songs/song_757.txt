Oh, Jeremih, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, Jeremih, yeah, yeah, yeah
Bring it
Her hips wave in the ocean in ways you wouldn't believe
She swear that she got that potion, well I hope there's plenty for me
'Cause I been searchin' for somebody to cater, cater to all my needs
And you look like your willin' to do the favor
So come with me and let me work that body
Body, body, body, ah ooh
You know just how I like it naughty
Naughty, naughty, naughty, do you?
Yeah, we got plenty of Bacardi
Bacardi, Bacardi, Bacardi and juice and fruit for you
A private after party
Party, party, party for two, for two
You can get my body, my body all over your body, baby
Your body all over my body, girl
You can get my body, my body all over your body, baby
Your body all over my body, girl
I'm feelin' like I should tip ya the way you're grindin' the pole
You're hot and fresh out the kitchen, here's a taste of that pot of gold
You make me feel like I'm up on a vacation
Cooler than summer breezes
Girl, get your groove back better than in Jamaica
Hope you don't mind if I'm behind that body
Body, body, body, ah ooh
You know just how I like it naughty
Naughty, naughty, naughty, do you?
Yeah, we got plenty of Bacardi
Bacardi, Bacardi, Bacardi and juice and fruit for you
A private after party
Party, party, party for two, for two
You can get my body, my body all over your body, baby
Your body all over my body, girl
You can get my body, my body all over your body
Your body all over my body
I love it when you roll
And still manage to clasp that, clasp that ass, clasp that
Just keep the candles on
And maybe I could wax that, wax that ass, wax that
Body, body, body, body, ah ooh, ah ooh
You know just how I like it naughty
Naughty, naughty, naughty, do you?
Yeah, we got plenty of Bacardi
Bacardi, Bacardi, Bacardi and juice and fruit for you
A private after party
Party, party, party for two, for two
You can get my body, my body all over your body, baby
Your body all over my body, girl
You can get my body, my body all over your body
Get that body all over my body, girl
