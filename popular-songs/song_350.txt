We were playin' out in Vegas
When this lady pressed her way up to the stage
And I forgot what I was singin'
When she met me with her meet-me-later gaze
And when she threw it on my mic stand
I figured they were probably double D's
That might make for a good story, man
But that don't make it easy loving me
One time I met one of my heroes
And he made me feel real good that I was there
'Cause whatever he was smokin', man
It had me spinnin' circles in my chair
I fell asleep on his bus in Texas
But I woke up in Memphis, Tennessee
That might make for a good story, man
But that don't make it easy loving me
But I got a woman
Let me tell you, man, she's somethin'
You don't catch me doin' nothin'
To ever make her wanna leave
She knows how much I love her, man
But that don't make it easy loving me
When you're livin' on a bus and you fill it up
With a bunch of real good timin' boys
Mix in applause and alcohol and honky tonks
You know we're bound to make some noise
But this rake and ramblin' life
Helps me write the kind of songs I wanna sing
'Cause it makes for real good stories, man
But that don't make it easy loving me
But I got a woman
Let me tell you, man, she's somethin'
You don't catch me doin' nothin'
To ever make her wanna leave
She knows how much I love her, man
But that don't make it easy loving me
Yeah, she knows how much I love her, man
But that don't make it easy loving me
