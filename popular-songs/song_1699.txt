I need to feel your heartbeat
When you say you love me
I don't wanna hear it
If it's something that you don't mean
If I had to leave you now
There would be an empty space
It doesn't matter anyhow
You can't take your things and go your own way
And there's two more lonely people
In the world tonight, baby you and I
Are just two more lonely people
Who gave up the fight, yeah, I'm on a ride
Well, you know my heart is aching
You don't have to break it
If love don't change your mind
Then there's two more lonely people tonight
I don't want your pictures
I don't want your sympathy
We don't have to be friends
We don't have to be enemies
In my head I break it down
And I am absolutely sure
That you and I could work it out
Or we could kill the lights on what we had before
And there's two more lonely people
In the world tonight, baby you and I
Are just two more lonely people
Who gave up the fight, yeah, I'm on a ride
Well, you know my heart is aching
You don't have to break it
If love don't change your mind
Then there's two more lonely people
Well, we got something special that should be enough
Nothing is predictable when it comes to love
Maybe, lately, baby, it's been a little rough
But if you walk away tonight
There'll be two more lonely people
In the world tonight, baby you and I
And just two more lonely people
Who gave up the fight
And there's two more lonely people
In the world tonight, baby you and I
Well, there's two more lonely people
Who gave up the fight, yeah, I'm on a ride
Well, you know my heart is aching
You don't have to break it
If love don't change your mind
Then there's two more lonely people tonight
