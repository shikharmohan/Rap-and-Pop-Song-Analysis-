Her long legs looked like trouble
As she sashayed through the door
And my mind flashed a warning sign
That I chose to ignore
For the prize I thought that I could win
The risk seemed mighty small
The bigger the fool, the harder the fall
I fell in love in the heat of passion
Oh, but passion has it's price
But under all that beauty
Beat a heart that was made of ice
God knows as far as I could see
She didn't have a flaw
But the bigger the fool, the harder the fall
I said, the warmer the kiss
The softer the skin
The sweeter the love
The more bitter the end
Well, one lesson I've learned that applies to all
The bigger the fool, the harder the fall
One day she was lovin' me
The next day she was gone
And I became another verse
To a lonesome heartbreak song
Now that I've learned to face the truth
The words stick in my craw
Well, the bigger the fool, the harder the fall
I said, the warmer the kiss
The softer the skin
The sweeter the love
The more bitter the end
Well, one lesson I've learned that applies to all
The bigger the fool, the harder the fall
The bigger the fool, the harder the fall
