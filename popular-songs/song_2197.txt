Lesser God
Lesser God
Lesser God
You get, you get, you get, you get to me
Holy is the time, it's such an easy way to go
You get, you get, you get, you get to me
Hide the struggle in the skin under a fingernail
Lesser God
Lesser God
Lesser God
Lesser God, oh you're lonely
Waste your time by saving worthless gullibles
Kill a politician and then wear his clothes
This decade is the age of re-hashing
Protest and then go to jail for trespassing
Two minutes
Slow
Slow
Slow
Slow
