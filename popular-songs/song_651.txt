Oh baby ,the room starts spinning 
i think the floors about to meet me 
every single time you step up on me
Oh baby ,its beyond butterflies now
its more like im mesmerized now
cant stay relaxed when you look into my eyes
Ive even got to whisper
then my knees get weak
dont let me see you coming
ill forget how to speak
and baby when your near me
i cant even think
its like im, oh i think im 
im about to Oh..
Oh.. Oh Oh Oh Oh..Faint baby
when i fall when i see you
cant stand up straight when i touch you Oh baby
Oh.. Oh Oh Oh Oh..Faint baby
when you do the things you do 
you make me wanna.. think im gunna.. faint
Oh baby ,when we getting close
you got that feeling i already know..
Oh..every single time im ready to hit the floor..
come and catch me before i am down
3, 2, 1 you know im out
im trying to calm down
what you do to me when your around
Ive even got to whisper 
then my knees get weak 
dont let me see you coming 
ill forget how to speak 
and baby when your near me i cant even think 
its like im, oh i think im im about to Oh.. 
Oh.. Oh Oh Oh Oh..Faint baby when i fall 
when i see you cant stand up straight when i touch you Oh baby 
Oh.. Oh Oh Oh Oh..Faint baby when you do the things you do you make me wanna.. think im gunna.. faint
Grab a pillow cause im about to fall hard
