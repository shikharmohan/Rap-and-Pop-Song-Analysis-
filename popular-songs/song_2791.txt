I still reach for you in the middle of my dreams each night
But my arms come up empty every time
And lately I talk to your memory more than I should
If I could just forget the past, I would
'Cause this missing you ain't doing me no good
I'm so close to crazy, right on the edge
Just one step away from going insane but I'm not there yet
If I could just lose my mind, I wouldn't know we're through
But this close to crazy is far from over you
Today I caught myself reliving how it used to be
At a table for two just you and me
But talking to an empty chair and laughing right out loud
Turned everybody's head and left no doubt
I'm a broken woman close to breaking down
I'm so close to crazy, right on the edge
Just one step away from going insane but I'm not there yet
If I could just lose my mind, I wouldn't know we're through
But this close to crazy is far from over you
Oh, this close to crazy is far from over you
I still reach for you in the middle of my dreams each night
