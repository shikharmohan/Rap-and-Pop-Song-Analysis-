[Intro:]
Huh [x32]
[Verse 1:]
She was on the way
I never saw her comin'
(Comin', come, come)
Everytime I figured out
It wasn't no use in runnin'
(Runnin', run, run)
I Thought that I was stronger
Couldn't be no wronger
Baby got me gone
Can't believe it
She...knew what she was doin' to me
She...had me in a coma for weeks
(I)
I can't sleep 'cuz
(All)
All I think is she
(She)
She might be the one but....
[Chorus:]
Baby girl's wrong for me 
I know it but she's giving it all to me
Can't let it go
This thing is takin' over me
Don't know what to do about this wrong
Can't leave her alone 'cuz
(She did it)
She got me doin' things I would never
(She did it)
Someone I'm hooked to forever
She done broke
She done broke
She done broke me down, down
I know my baby's wrong
I love her but she's wrong for me
[Verse 2:]
I'm really tryna find a way to get hold of it
(Hold, hold, hold)
It's getting' kinda crazy
Gotta get control of it
(Hold it, hold it, hold it)
I never been so caught up
Wasn't how I was brought up
It's gone on for too long
Ain't no way out
She...knew what she was doin' to me
(Doin' to me)
She...had me in a coma for weeks
(Weeks, I)
I can't sleep 'cuz
(All)
All I think is
(She)
She might be the one but...
[Chorus:]
Baby girl's wrong for me
I know it but she's giving it all to me
(I know it but, givin' it all to me, yeah)
Can't let it go
This thing is takin' over me
(Over me, yeah)
I don't know what to do about this wrong
Can't leave her alone 'cuz
(Oh no, no)
(She did it)
She got me doin' things I would never
(She got doin' things I never did)
(She did it)
Someone I'm hooked to forever
(Someone I'm hooked to forever)
She done broke
She done broke
She done broke me down, down
(Broke me down, broke me down)
I know my baby's wrong
(Oh)
I love her but she's wrong
[Bridge & Adlibs/Outro:]
I love her but I know I'm not supposed to be with her
(I don't care)
I don't care 'cuz I just gotta, gotta be with her
Oh yeah she did it
(Did it, did it, did it)
(She really did it huh, damn -oh, no, no, no-)
She did it
(Did it, did it, did it)
I need you here
Can't leave you alone
Baby girl's wrong for me
Thought that I was stronger
Couldn't be no wronger
Yes she did it
(Did it, did it, did it)
She got me doin' things I would never
(She got me gone, can't believe it, no, no, no)
Baby girl's wrong for me
(Wrong for me, damn)
Yes she did it
(Yeah)
She got me doin' things I would never
(She got me, oh)
Baby girl's wrong for me
(Baby girl's wrong for me)
