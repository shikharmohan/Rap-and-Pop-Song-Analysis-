I thought you knew
I guess I assumed too much
I don't know how but now we're so far out of touch
And I never planned to so misunderstand
But what you needed you never asked me to give
And I swear as I live
I thought you knew my heart was yours
And that we were so together, that we would always be
I don't believe you leaving me's the answer
I'm not asking you to let me rush back in and fail again
I'm asking for one chance not to assume
So I can say and do all the things I thought you knew
So here we are and so far we're still so far
From where we know we should be
I'm searching for words and you haven't heard
I thought you knew my heart was yours
And that we were so together, that we would always be
I don't believe you leaving me's the answer
I'm not asking you to let me rush back in and fail again
I'm asking for one chance not to assume
So I can say and do all the things I thought you knew
I thought you knew
Oh, God I thought you knew
