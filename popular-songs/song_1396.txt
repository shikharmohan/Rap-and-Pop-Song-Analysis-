You know sometimes me and my lady
Have these crazy fights and when we do
It makes me wonder if we're ever gonna get it right
When I think about leaving I think about me
What my life would be like if I were back to being free
Go where I wanna go, do what I wanna do
Wouldn't have a soul I had to answer to
When I think about leaving I think about me
You know I got a friend, him and his wife
Just couldn't see eye to eye he had all he could stand
One day and just packed up and said goodbye
When I think about leaving I think about him
That little apartment 'cross town he's living in
Got an old corvette, got a new girlfriend
But only sees his kids every other weekend
When I think about leaving, oh I think about him
I never will forget her face
Or the day she told me about her dad
How he walked out on her
And her mom when she was just a kid
When I think about leaving, oh I think about her
Only five years old and her heart filled up with hurt
With her little arms wrapped around his neck saying
"Daddy where you going, are you coming back?"
When I think about leaving, oh I think about her
You know the truth is, most of the time things are really great
And I know we got something special
When I think about leaving I think about us
How we buildin' this love we share on faith and trust
The honest way we talk, the tender way we touch
All those nights we spent making love
When I think about leaving, oh I think about us
When I think about leaving, oh I think again
Even though that thought crosses my mind every now and then
In my heart I know I would never leave
There's nowhere else on earth that I would rather be
When I think about leaving, I think again
When I think about leaving
When I think about leaving
When I think about leaving
I think again
