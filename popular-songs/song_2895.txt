In this life we all go through hard times
When we struggle and pray for a lifeline
Just needing someone
To show us the way
To you the glass might seem half empty
But it's half full to those without any
So hold on to hope
And try to have faith
Oh, you've got to have faith
If there's just one secret to living
Whoever you are
It's learning the meaning of giving
With an open heart/With an open heart
If you offer the best part of yourself
Even when you don't have anything else
Honest and true
It'll come back to you
Love comes back to you
To you the glass might seem half empty
But it's half full to those without any
So hold on to hope
And try to have faith
Oh, you've got to have faith
With your arms wide open
The world opens wide
And you'll believe it deep inside
That there's just one secret to living
Whoever you are
It's finding that true joy in giving
With an open heart/With an open heart
