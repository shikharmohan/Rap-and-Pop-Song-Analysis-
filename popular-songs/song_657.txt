You're perfect
Oh, perfect
I just can't control myself
I can't be with no one else
It seems I'm addicted to the way
You like to touch me
I don't think they understand
Why I love at your command
From the words you speak so deep
Our bodies meet, I have to have you
I love you, you're perfect
A manifestation of my dreams
You make my body feel
About a million different things
I think God made you for me
A mix of passion and fidelity
Baby, you're so complete
I write this song to let you know
That you will always be
To me, my lust, my love, my man
My child, my friend and my king
I love you, you're perfect
A manifestation of my dreams
You make my body feel
About a million different things
There's no way I'd leave you
It's just not a reality
Sometimes I feel like I'm
Living in a fantasy
