Last night, all smiles, we were holding hands.
And now you, wont share the bed with me,
Explain if you can.
We may not agree on this, but lets not fight.
Because who cares who is wrong or right? i
Feel like i can't breathe like this--your
Grip is too tight.
Taken by surprise, because i felt so secure.
Because all the things, that you've done,
Have let me wondering.
We may not agree on this, but lets not fight.
Because who cares who is wrong or right? i
Feel like i can't breathe like this--your
Grip is too tight.
You leave me breathless with your words
We can say that we've changed, together,
Another day--give me your hand, let me
Explain, because i've come to terms with
Who you are.
We may not agree on this, but lets not fight.
Because who cares who is wrong or right? i
Feel like i can't breathe like this-your grip
Is too tight--let's not fight. your grip is too,
Is too--tight.
You leave me breathless with your words.
