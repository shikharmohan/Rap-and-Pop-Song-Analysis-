I'm crazy over you
I don't know what to do
I don't understand why I'm crazy over you
I don't know what to do
(If I had to)
I would give up everything just to feel and be with you
(If I had to)
I would pawn the ring you gave to me just to feed you
(If I had to)
I would give my very last breath just to help save you
(If I had to)
I would tell a lie just because I know you are the truth
I'd ryde for you 'cause you're the truth
I'd die for you, ooh 'cause I'm a fool in love with you
And I'll do anything that pleases you, only you
(If I had to)
I would throw away my only wish just to prove to you
(If I had to)
I would die all alone if livin' meant without you
(If I had to)
I would go through all the pain again just to find you
(If I had to)
I'd surrender all my love just because I have you
I don't understand why I'm crazy over you
I don't know what to do
I don't understand why I'm crazy over you
I don't know what to do
I'd ryde for you 'cause you're the truth
I'd die for you, ooh, 'cause I'm a fool
In love with you and I'll do anything that pleases you
I'd ryde for you 'cause you're the truth
I'd die for you, ooh, 'cause I'm a fool in love with you
And I'll do anything that pleases you, only you
I wanna run to you, breathe as one with you
Absent in time without you, existing only for you
Every dream is of you, only turn to you
My baby, my love, only turn to you
Ooh, I'd ryde for you 'cause you're the truth
I'd die for you, ooh, 'cause I'm a fool in love with you
And I'll do anything that pleases you
I'm gonna ryde for you, ooh
I'd ryde for you 'cause you're the truth
I'd die for you, ooh, 'cause I'm a fool in love with you
And I'll do anything that pleases you, only you
I'd ryde for you 'cause you're the truth
I'd die for you, ooh, 'cause I'm a fool in love with you
And I'd do anything that pleases you, yeah
