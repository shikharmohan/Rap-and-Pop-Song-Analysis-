I'm tell y'all a lil' story man, ya know what I'm sayin'?
Yo this is a song about, somebody who did me wrong dawg
I thought you was my homie man, I guess not, fuck it
You were supposed to be my dog
Homey when I first met you what was told to me was fraud
What a shocker an impostor, I been crossed I lost ya
My best friend turned out to be an enemy the sin in me hit me
No sympathy, no empathy either
Homey I never denied ya nothing that you wanted
Women, I never player hated I hooked
You up booked you up from the beginning the sin in me had
Love for you shed blood for you when you wanted to dig
I dug for you nigga but you a double crosser nasty hand tosser
I should've known you was evil, when you told me it was cool
For we to be sex fools when we under the steeple the retrieval
I'm trying to get my life back no more stopping women
From putting a knife at your cap remember when we were
Kickin' it bitches was giving everyday we did it in
Every way, but the respect went away you got a mind of
Your own now you're grown now can I ask you a question
Did you forget we were kinfolk nigga we the same complexion?
I'm stressing you was always in front of me so I listened everyday
You wanted me on a mission I even let you have sex
With my lady like a G infatuated with you and not me
I sucked it up; I got back with her you fucked it up
By letting her know I creeping around with every chick in the
Town buster, I should've known not to trust you
Listen I'm losing my life because of you
I lost my life because of you, I'm losing my wife because of you
I even had sex and a baby with that crazy bitch you introduced me to
Now I'm straight depressed, I hate your flesh
The fate was just, belate the Tech laid to rest
Every time you got drawls you made my
Poor little life fall nigga you got balls
You ain't never had a partner like me, real a never
Ever sold you pipe dreams personal yes it might seem
Nigga when you was burning, I went and got the doxcycline
Looked out for your health, and this is all the respect
I get hater your neck I slit but I can't 'cause I'm
Attached to ya and I don't know why sometimes I wish
You would just die
It would eliminate all this hurt maybe I could
Get up out of all this dirt you caused me so strong
Nothing can stop ya not even cerebral pawlsy I can't believe
It my best homey turned on me you must have forgot
We grew up together I'm through life is over now it's
Nothing else to do point the finger and blame it on you
(It's all because of you, you, you)
I lost my girl, my world is upside down because I found you wasn't shit
(It's all because of you, you, you)
Broke us into you untrue, don't know what to do I'm talking to you, who?
My dick, my dick, my dick
