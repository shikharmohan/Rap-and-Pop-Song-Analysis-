[1st verse]
If you got scratch
Nigga
Get the fuck up
Throw your hands up
If you hella
Fucked up
Einstein
Tech n9ne
Two triple zip
Crack a jaw
Whip 'em all
If they wanna trip
Ladies with the bar codes
Meet me after this
Maybe you can show me
The meaning of abyss
Everybody on the wall
Momma is a bzzz
Had her at
The budgetel
Stroking
On my dzzz
This ones
For the psychos
Gang bangers
And sluts
Bumbs holding the pipe
Those
College graduate fucks
I feel for no foes
I kill till I close
My trap
I'm ill when I flow
And you never doze
When I rap
Tech tech
Gimme women and much alcohol
And I'm straight
Eat drink
And be merry
Yo come tomorrow
Might be your fate
Yo look
Look over there
It's that
Nigga with the hair
Tech and juan
What a pair
The rest equals
Mc squares
What

Who got this
Mutha fucking house
On lock
Who

Huh what
Tech n9ne
Dwamn
Who keeps it sizzling
Who keeps it hot
Who
Einstien
Huh what
Tech n9ne
Dwamn
K c mo roll

[2nd verse]
Everybody witness
My soul sickness
If you dig tech
When he's twisted
Then go get this
Bringing the house down
When I rip shit
Like the plates shifted
Angels come in many shades
Either drunk or lifted
The einstein
Meaning gifted
Too slick to get with
My shit was broke
But now I fixed it
With the quickness
You missed it
When I used to roll with
Misfits and nitwits
But now who I do biz with
Ain't none of yo business
Blood thirst
In the church now
The earth's
The worst
Clutch your purse
When we lurk
Cause we cursed
From work
Trying to
Party like a mutha fucka
Broke as a joke
Don't hire me
But you arrest me
When I'm selling my dope
So who's the einstein
In n9ne n9ne
Tech n9ne
I'm crime mind
In my prime
I'm mixing
One fifty-one
With malibu rum
And pineapple juice
Among all my angels
And wicked ones
We're the party people
Night and day
Living crazy is the only way
Einstein
When I'm on it
Einstein
Rock it
Like you mutha fuckers want it
[hook]
Who got this
Mutha fucking house
Who
Einstein
Huh what
Tech n9ne
Dwamn
Who keeps it sizzling
Who keeps it hot
Who
Einstein
Huh what
Tech n9ne
Dwamn
K c mo roll

[3rd verse]
What do we say
To haters off top
Haters got beef
They thinking we got
We gon get postal
If it don't stop
You can get ghost
Or you can get shot
Generation x
Gon party till the death
Anybody tripping
Gettin greeted with a stretch
Taking everything
And we're leaving nothing left
Demons gotta die
Have 'em breathing last breaths
I feel that
I got will
And I'm gon bill
Till I'm killed
Bell till I bail
If I fail
Then I'm gon steal
What I will
Tech is a realist
Running with killas
You better vill this
Be the witness
To the coldest
When I hold this dick
They break camp
When I flow this
Einstein go the ill route
Throw up your hands
If you're villed out
Or if you're real sauced
I told y'all I'm cold
Dog I flows
All heat
I'm representing
Rogue dog
Rogue dog
Fifty-seventh street
