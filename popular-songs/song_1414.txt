You know sometimes me and my lady have these crazy fights and when we do it makes me wonder if we're gonna get it right..
When I think about leavin' I think about me, what my life would be like if I were back to bein' free, where I wanna go, what I wanna do, wouldn't have a soul I had to answer to, when I think about leavin' I think about me...
You know I gotta friend, and him and his wife just couldn't see eye to eye he had all he could stand one day, and just packed up and said GoodBye..
When I think about leavin' I think about him, that little apartment 'cross town he's livin' in, got an old corvette, got a new girlfriend, but he only sees his kids every other weekend, when I think about leavin' oh I think about him..
I never will forget her face, or the day she told me about her dad, how he walked out on her and her mom when she was just a kid..
When I think about leavin' oh I think about her, only five years old and her heart filled up with hurt, with her little arms  wrapped around his neck sayin' daddy where ya goin'? are ya commin' back ? When I think about leavin' oh I think about her...
You know truth is most of the time, things are really great, and I know we got somethin' special..
When I think about leavin' I think about us, how we buildin' this love we share on faith and trust, Honest way we talk, Tender way we touch, all those nights we spend makin' love, When I think about leavin' I think about us..
 when I think about leavin' oh I think again, even though that thought crosses my mind every now and then, In my heart I know I would never leave there's no where else on earth that I would rather be, when I think about leavin' I think again.. When I think about leavin' .. When I think about leavin'.. When I think about leavin'.....I think again..
