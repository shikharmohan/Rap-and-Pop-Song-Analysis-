She can concentrate on workin'
Until her work is done
She can hold a conversation
As well as anyone
She'll fool you with sincerity
And if you did't know her well
You would never see it
You could never tell
She's just lookin' for him
She's only rememberin'
She might look like she's ready
To fall in love again
But she's just lookin' for him
She keeps one eye on the road
And one on the other lane
Lookin' for his car
His memory is replayed
She searches other faces
Tryin' to find that spark
But no one new can reach her
Or fill her hollow heart
She's just lookin' for him
She's only rememberin'
She might look like she's ready
To fall in love again
But she's just lookin' for him
Oh, you'd better keep your distance
Don't let her reel you in
She's not quite herself now
How could she be when
She's just lookin' for him
She's only rememberin'
She might look like she's ready
To fall in love again
But she's just lookin'
Oh, she's really just lookin'
She's just lookin'
