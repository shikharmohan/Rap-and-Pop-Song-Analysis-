Boy I never knew I could feel
The way I felt when I felt the way
You were feeling me, baby
I'm so out of control, yeah
Every time you look my way
I realize more and more
How much I adore those pretty eyes of yours
I'm helpless baby
What I wanna know is
Are you willing to try?
Can you love me for a lifetime
In just one night?
Baby, I love you
Baby, I need you
I gotta have you
Can't be without you
Baby, I love you
Baby, I need you
I gotta have you
Can't be without you
Blessed and cursed on the same day
The day that I first felt the power of you
Inside of me, such a strong feeling
There comes a time in everyone's life
When you know and everyone around you knows
That everything is changed
You're not the same, it's a new day
Oh, what I wanna know is
Are you willing to try?
There's gotta be more meaning to this
Than what meets the eye
Baby, I love you
Baby, I need you
I gotta have you
Can't be without you
Baby, I love you
Baby, I need you
I gotta have you
Can't be without you
Oh, I love the way you kiss me
Oh, baby please, I'm about to lose my mind
Oh talk to me 'cause, 'cause I'm begging for you
And I'm down on my knees
Baby, I know you're the one that I need
Baby, I love you
You know I need you
Gotta have you
Can't be without you
Baby, I love you
You know I need you
Gotta have you
Can't be without you
Baby, I love you
Baby, I need you
I gotta have you
Can't be without you
