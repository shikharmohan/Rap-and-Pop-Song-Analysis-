Grew up south of the Mason Dixon
Working, spitting, hunting and fishing
Stone cold country by the grace of God
I was gassing up the other day
An old boy pulled up with a license plate
From Ohio I thought, oh, good Lord, he's lost
From his wranglers to his boots
He reminded me of Chris LeDoux
And that Copenhagen smile
A country must be country wide
In every state there's a station
Playing Cash, Hank Willie and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives
There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide
It ain't where, it's how you live
We weren't raised to take, we were raised to give
The shirt off our back to anyone in need
We bow our heads before we eat
Before we start our day, before we fall asleep
'Cause in God we trust and we believe
And we see what's wrong
And we know what's right
And old Hank, he said it all
When he said country folks can survive
In every state there's a station
Playing Cash, Hank Willie and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives
There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide, yeah
In every state there's a station
Playing Cash, Hank Willie and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives
There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind
In every state there's a station
Playing Cash, Hank Willie and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives
There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind
There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide
