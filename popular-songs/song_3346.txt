Baby, I've been drifting away
And dreaming all day
Of holding you, touching you
The only thing I wanna do is be with you
As close to you as I can be
Let's make love, all night long
Until all our strength is gone
Hold on tight, just let go
I wanna feel you in my soul
Until the sun comes up
Let's make love
Oh, baby
Do you know what you do to me
Everything inside of me
Is wanting you and needing you
I'm so in love with you
Look in my eyes, let's get lost tonight
In each other
Let's make love, all night long
Until all our strength is gone
Hold on tight, just let go
I want to feel you in my soul
Until the sun comes up
Let's make love
Let's make love, all night long
Until all our strength is gone
And hold on tight, just let go
I want to feel you in my soul
Until the sun comes up
Oh, until the sun comes up
Let's make love
Oh, baby, let's make love
All night long, let's make love
