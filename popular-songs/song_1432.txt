Sometimes they're in a bottle
Sometimes a pair of high-heel shoes
Some come rolled in paper
Some have six strings and only play the blues
Once you've met the Devil
There ain't no way he'll let you be
When I'm not chasing demons
There's demons chasing me
The skeletons in closets
Ghosts underneath the bed
They hide out in pictures
And words better left unsaid
They hang around like perfume
And haunt me like an ancient melody
When I'm not chasing demons
There's demons chasing me
There's things that I can't leave alone
'Cause they won't leave me alone
'Cause what I want ain't what I need
Still I reach for the things I crave
And better try to run away
Maybe I'm afraid of being free
'Cause when I'm not chasing demons
There's demons chasing me
So roll one up and light it
Pick up my old guitar
I'm playing 'Crossroads'
Drinking whiskey from a mason jar
There's heartache at my front door
Says she needs my company
When I'm not chasing demons
There's demons chasing me
There's things that I can't leave alone
'Cause they won't leave me alone
What I want ain't what I need
Still I reach for the things I crave
Better try to run away
Am I afraid of being free? You tell me
'Cause when I'm not chasing demons
There's demons chasing me
When I'm not chasing demons
There's demons chasing me
There's demons chasing me
There's demons chasing me
When I'm not chasing demons
There's demons chasing me
There's demons chasing me
Demons chasing me
There's demons chasing me
When I'm not chasing demons
There's demons chasing me
