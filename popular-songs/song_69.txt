I wanna be a hillbilly prayin' for the rain
Drink corn whiskey, raise a little cane
You can have the big city, I wanna be a hillbilly
The city folks got worries, a country boy's got none
All I wanna be is the daddy of a farmer's son
The subdivisions are silly, I wanna be a hillbilly
I wanna be a hillbilly prayin' for the rain
Drink corn whiskey, raise a little cane
You can have the big city, I wanna be a hillbilly
When I get finished plowin', I'm gonna go to the pond
And take my sweet baby and have some good clean fun
You gotta work, that's a pity, I'm gonna be a hillbilly
I wanna be a hillbilly prayin' for the rain
Drink corn whiskey, raise a little cane
You can have the big city, I wanna be a hillbilly, so
When I die, throw a big fine wake
And have a party in the barn, let me lie in state
An' plant me under that oak tree, I wanna be a hillbilly
I wanna be a hillbilly prayin' for the rain
Drink corn whiskey, raise a little cane
You can have the big city, I wanna be a hillbilly
The subdivisions are silly, I wanna be a hillbilly
