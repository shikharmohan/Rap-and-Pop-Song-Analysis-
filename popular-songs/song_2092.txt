It's so pretty, yeah
Now I don't wanna jump the gun or misunderstand anyone
But I think maybe you have been feeling something lately
Well, I know we got an understanding you ain't my girl, I ain't your man
But I think maybe you have been feeling this thing changing
Feelings I got for you couldn't dry it's the truth
But you want something new baby
We got a simple thing but it's about to change
Or will it stay the same maybe
No matter what the road I've passed
Still has a load of loves and lusts
And not much trust
But are you saying this can't be us
Let me get this right girl you want us to be
Official make this thing for real
You for real? Baby let me know
Let me get this right
You want to make me the happiest
Man in the world is that the deal?
Girl for real baby please be sure
Let me get this right
I know I heard you but come again please
It's what I want, exactly what I need
Are to believe that we're both on the same page
Threw away my black book think I'm done with that look
You took long enough to come into my life
Hey, are you feeling what I feel girl? Yeah
The feelings I got for you couldn't dry it's the truth
But you want something new baby
We got a simple thing but it's about to change
Or will it stay the same maybe
No matter what the road I've passed
You have a load of loves and lust
And not much trust
But are you saying this can't be us
Let me get this right girl you want us to be
Official make this thing for real
You for real? baby let me know
