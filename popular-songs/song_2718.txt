Oh, you've sold me
You hold me, you've told me, I'll be getting all your love
You can go wrong if you hold on for so long
Just because you hate to give up
Do I love you, ooh, ooh, I'm afraid I do
Do you love me
Once upon a time, I was sure I knew
I don't like what I been thinkin'
If its true, oh you know I'm a fool
Face to face you promise me forever
But the ring's still sittin' in a store downtown
And I'm still sittin' here waitin' for the deal to go down
I get lonely
And lonely is only the hardest way to spend the night
Then you call me, you call me and stall me
And swear you're gonna make it right
So I hang on, ooh, thats just the way things are
But the pay off, I been waitin' for it just might break my heart
Oh, I don't like what I been thinkin'
If its true, oh you know I'm a fool
Face to face you promise me forever
But the ring's still sittin' in a store downtown
And I'm still sittin' here waitin' for the deal to go down
Is there someone out there, I don't know about
Convince me baby, beyond the shadow of a doubt
Oh, I don't like what I been thinkin'
If its true, oh, you know, I'm a fool
Face to face you promise me forever
But the ring's still sittin' in a store downtown
And I'm still sittin' here waitin' for the deal to go down
Oh, I'm waitin' for the deal to go down
