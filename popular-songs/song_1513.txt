Put off the mail and I left on a light and I
Locked up the house and I jumped on a flight and I'm
Still by myself but I'm thinking more clear
If I'm gonna be down, gonna be down, way down here
Where no one will ask 'cause nobody knows
That you're not in my life anymore
And no one can tell the salt water from my tears
Nor the pull of the tide or the crash of the waves
Ain't gonna wash your memory away
But there's a beautiful view of the end of the world from the pier
If I'm gonna be down, I'm gonna be down, way down here
Untied my lines and I slid through the sound and I
Mixed me a drink now I sit on the bow and I'm
Watching the sun just like you'll disappear
If I'm gonna be down, I'm gonna be down, way down here
Where no one will ask 'cause nobody knows
That you're not in my life anymore
And no one can tell the salt water from my tears
Nor the pull of the tide or the crash of the waves
Ain't gonna wash your memory away
But there's a beautiful view of the end of the world from the pier
If I'm gonna be down, I'm gonna be down, way down here
Nor the pull of the tide or the crash of the waves
Ain't gonna wash your memory away
But there's a beautiful view of the end of the world from the pier
And if I'm gonna be down, I'm gonna be down
If I'm gonna be down, I'd rather be down, way down here, way down here
If you want me back now I can be found way down here
If I'm gonna be down, if I'm gonna be down, way down here
