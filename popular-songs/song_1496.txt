We had a dog named Bocephus livin in the front yard
He liked sleeping out on top of the car
He drank beer out of the mason jar
And he climb up on everyone in bed
A white frame house in a college town
A bunch of people always hangin' around
No real problems we needed to drown
But we tried our best anyway
We went to class just to pass the time
Back in '89
We had a keg in the closet
Pizza on the floor
Left over from the night before
Where we were going we didn't really care
We had all we ever wanted
In that keg in the closet
This ol' guitar taught me how to score
Right there on that Lambda Chi porch
Mary Ann taught me a little more
About wanting what you can't have
Sweatshirts and flag football
Spring breaks down in Panama
For a while we had it all
We never dreamed it wouldn't last
We went to class just to pass the time
Back in '89
We had a keg in the closet
Pizza on the floor
Left over from the night before
Where we were going we didn't really care
We had all we ever wanted
In that keg in the closet
We all kinda went our separate ways
But I swear it seems like yesterday
Keg in the closet
Pizza on the floor
Left over from the night before
Where we were going we didn't really care
We had all we ever wanted
In that keg in the closet
Hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm
