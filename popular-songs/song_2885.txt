What you need do you know I got it?
All I'm asking is
For a little respect when you come home
(Just a little bit)
Hey baby

When you get home

I ain't gonna do you wrong while you're gone
Ain't gonna do ya wrong 'cause I don't wanna
All I'm asking
Is for a little respect when you get home
(Just a little bit)
Hey baby

And all I'm asking in return, honey
Is to give me my propers when you get home
(Just a little bit)

When you get home

But guess what, so is my money
And all I want you to do for me is
Give me some respect when you get home
