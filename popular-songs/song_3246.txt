Huh
Yo it don't start until I get there
Show them how to Gansta Shap
Cause where I'm from
That's where all the ganstaz at
And when we come
Yo we get to actin a ass
And we go dumb
If we get to moving to fast
See we go stuie-ooowee
From the Bay all the way
To Missouri-ouri
Back it up on me mama
Look what you do to me-ooowee
We do it raw
Gone off Caribou Louy-ooowee
More then super dooey-ooowee
Cheers!
One or two beers and you shap
It's like lean and rock wit it
Only you don't lean and snap
You like left side, right side, hands about chest high
Then you wink at shorty in the corner with the left eye
How you doin?
I'm off a lil somethin leanin
Weed got my nerves, got a lil trouble breathin (breathin)
Me and my heathen's is about to turn this mother out
Dip in the whip, burn rubber out
Gangsta Shap
[Chorus][4X]
Gangsta Shap
GangÃ¢Â¦ Gang
Gangsta Shap
GangÃ¢Â¦ Gang
[Kutt Calhoun]
Wait a minute hold up
There's too many chiefs and not enough soldiers
For the world wars
Standin on the front line tight in my toga
I'm a Greek God
Blood aphliated, Duce Klik Street Mobb
Man I put this souly on my dookie brown dickeys
Hail to the B side
Capnaptavate these Killa City killings
Nigga you can't calculate big clips (Long)
Inner City menaces, These kids get it (on)
We don't fight no more
All we do is this *Cocking Gun*
All we do is this *Gunshot*
Lately it's been through a bitch
And that's cost for livin in
The center of Killa City
Where these niggaz Willy Wonka chop at any men
Who feeling they really raw
Get to pullin dogs at the dark demonians
Nobody for you to call
When it do desolve
Just a harsh remembrance
You might have got through it all but was too involved
And it's very scary
It's kind of pathetic
Nobody is sympathetic when you dead and buried
We rugged and rigid no pun is intended
And when them thangs go clap
We gangstaz man
We bring the trap
Remember killaz don't dance man
We G-G-G.. GangÃ¢Â¦ G-G-GÃ¢Â¦..
[Chorus][4X]
Gangsta Shap
GangÃ¢Â¦ Gang
Gangsta Shap
GangÃ¢Â¦ Gang

I remember my school days
When I was dancer
Back when LL Cool J was walkin with a panther
Actually dancing was not
But rap was the answer
But with the shap
It was cool for the gangstaz to dance to
Still here we stand with this dance
That spread like a cancer
Cool for the man
Even the woman or the baby in pampers
Dancin is deep
And it's dirty like the crevice of your hamper
Raisin your hands up high in this bitch
Cause you amped up
(Go)
Nike, Air Jordan at the bottom
In the middle was a Nautica pair
Lot of erotica there
But up top I got the gangsta black
Doin the Gangsta Shap
Nigga thanks for that
Imperial! nigga 
You don't want to see me go speedy
Bro need to see me flow
Never get this choppin up out of me
He better see the dough
We be so cold wit it
Boy we need some wool mittens
Ladies just roll wit it
Everything is cool kitten
Tilt your head like you got some screws missin
But have that look on your face
Like when you say you bullshittin
Gangsta Shap
