Lost in the city
Deserted and cold
Watchin' the cars passin' by
They're all goin' places
That we used to go
And it's drivin' me out of my mind
And it's makin' me blue
Indelibly blue
I can't erase the memories of me and you
Indelibly blue
They say when one love is ended
Another is born
That's no consolation to me
Just show me some sunlight
A rose without thorns
And maybe I'll start to believe
Well just color me blue
Indelibly blue
I can't erase the memories of me and you
Indelibly blue
Oh all of my life
I've waited for one love to make it alright
But now I feel heartaches and tears
Of a sad souvenirs that you left me
Since you left me
I'll just go on a day at a time
Trying in vain to forget you
But time and again you enter my mind
Someday I swear
I won't let you
'Cause baby I'm blue
Indelibly blue
I can't erase the memories of me and you
Indelibly blue
So just color me blue
Indelibly blue
I can't erase the memories of me and you
Indelibly blue
