So long, farewell
Hello, to the new me, the better me
That's right
My life
21, and I've realized
Everything you want's not meant to be
21 then you qualify
The standard to responsibilities
So I tried to prioritize
By deciding what I know is best for me
And then there's always love that tries to trip you up
You try to catch yourself before you hit the ground
But nothing's promised
Friends are there to cheer you up
To give you strength and mend you up when you are down
So I set sail in motion
I say so long, farewell
My life's moving forward, my ship has sailed
And I'm so glad it's over, my heart is well
After all that I've been through I found myself
22, I hope that I'm
With someone who truly cares for me
If I'm not, I'll be alright
I'll accept the time I know God has for me
One day I'll be the perfect wife
And that's what destiny, yeah
And I won't be afraid to try
Though it's always
Love that tries to trip you up
But then someone who sweep you off the ground
But nothing's promised
I'm not gonna give it up
Just because the last one let me down
So I set sail in motion
And I say so long, farewell
My ship has sailed
And I'm so glad it's over, my heart is well
After all that I've been through I found myself
I'm looking out for me
Taking care of my needs
Life isn't guaranteed
It's time to start living
It won't always be the same
Can't be afraid of change
You wanna have your way
Mad till you're satisfied
You lower your self esteem
You gotta live your dream
It's all bout confidence
So let them know that you can stand up
You never try
Learn to express you mind
Sometimes you gotta fight
It's your life so don't you give up, no
So long, farewell
My life's moving forward, that ship has sailed
And I'm so glad it's over, my heart is well
After all that I've been through I found myself
After all that I've been through I found myself
After all that I've been through I found myself
