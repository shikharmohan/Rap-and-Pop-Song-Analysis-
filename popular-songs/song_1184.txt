When I picked you up for our first date baby
Well, your pretty blue eyes, they were driving me crazy
And the tiny little thought that was so amazing
Is they were looking at me
I held open the car door for you
Then you climbed inside and slid on over
To the other side
I thought my, oh my
Sweet thing
The moon is high and the night is young, come on and meet me
In the backyard under the Cottonwood tree, it's a good thing
And I'm wishing
C'mon sweet thing
Won't you climb on out of your window while the world's sleeping?
You know I need you and there's no way I'll be leaving
'Til we're kissing on the porch swing, oh my little sweet thing
Yeah, I know I'm gonna see you first thing tomorrow
But I just couldn't wait so I had to borrow
Uncle Jake's Mustang, it's his favorite car
And so I can't stay long
Standing here feeling like a love struck Romeo
All I wanna do is hold you close and steal a little more time
Is that such a crime?
Sweet thing
The moon is high and the night is young, come on and meet me
In the backyard under the Cottonwood tree, it's a good thing
And I'm wishing
C'mon sweet thing
Won't you climb on out of your window while the world's sleeping?
'Cause you know I need you and there's no way I'll be leaving
'Til we're kissing on the porch swing, oh my sweet thing, woo!
Oh my sweet thing, sweet thing, sweet thing
Oh my sweet thing
The moon is high and the night is young, come on and meet me
In the backyard under the Cottonwood tree, it's a good thing
Tell me I'm not dreaming, oh!
Sweet thing
Won't you climb on out of your window while the world's sleeping?
'Cause you know I need you and there's no way I'll be leaving
'Til we're kissing on the porch swing, oh my little sweet thing, woo!
Aw c'mon sweet thing, sweet thing, sweet thing, sweet thing
C'mon, little now
Oh my little sweet thing, yes you are
