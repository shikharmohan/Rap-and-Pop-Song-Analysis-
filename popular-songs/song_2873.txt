You spend an awful lot of time in Massachusetts
Seems like every other week, you've got a meeting waiting there
Business must be booming or could something else
Be moving in the air up there
You say that it's important for our future
An executive on his way up has got to play the part
And each time duty calls you got to give it all
You've got with all your heart
When whoever's in New England through with you
And Boston finds better things to do
Oh, you know it's not too late
And you'll always have a place to come back to
When whoever's in New England's through with you
I hear the winter time up north can last forever
And I've been told it's beautiful to see this time of year
They say the snow can blind you till the world you left behind
Just disappears I hear
I packed your bags and I left them in the hollow way
But before you leave again there's just one thing you outta know
When the icy wind blows through you remember that it's me
Who feels the cold most of all
When whoever's in New England through with you, ohh
In Boston they can find better things to do
Oh, you know, it's not too late
And you'll always have a place to come back to
When whoever's in New England through with you
