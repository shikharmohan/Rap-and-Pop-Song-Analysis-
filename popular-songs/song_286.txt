I feel it, it's in me tonight
I see this tonight, I'm a borderline
I see him, he's walking out
He gives me the eye, and he's a thug
What's the deal, I'm 21
I'm [Incomprehensible], and I'm free to run
That's the one I met this morning
Pulling me to the floor wanna get to know me
I'm ready to have fun, let's bang the thing up
But you gotta be prepared to get your weight up
See I'm at the train since I came up
In the ATL is where it came from
Bang it up, boy, gon' bang it up
I'm full grown you can go tear it up, bang it up
Bang it up, boy, gon' bang it up
Last one I had on the floor couldn't do nothing, bang it up
Bang it up, boy, gon' bang it up, bang it up
Bang it up, boy, gon' bang it up, bang it up
Don't talk about it boy be about it
If you got it we can see about it shorty what's up
Wait a minute, no, he didn't
Ya'll the DJ tried to slow it up
Oh, my bad, he didn't
All he did was erra switched it up
See it, now you see that
'Cause this burn up will start acting up
Ya'll might let me start showing my signs
Ain't nobody here seen my fun
I'm ready to have fun, let's bang the thing up
But you gotta be prepared to get your weight up
See I'm at the train since I came up
In the ATL is where it came from
Bang it up, boy, gon' bang it up
I'm full grown you can go tear it up, bang it up
Bang it up, boy, gon' bang it up
Last one I had on the floor couldn't do nothing, bang it up
Bang it up, boy, gon' bang it up, bang it up
Bang it up, boy, gon' bang it up, bang it up
Don't talk about it boy be about it
If you got it we can see about it shorty what's up
I see you riding that butt acting like you are
Never seen me before, gonna like it, you know it don't ya
They said you wanna know, what's taking me so long
Since you've been patient, boy, you got the right to hold
Bang it up, boy, gon' bang it up
I'm full grown you can go tear it up, bang it up
Bang it up, boy, gon' bang it up
Last one I had on the floor couldn't do nothing, bang it up
Bang it up, boy, gon' bang it up, bang it up
Bang it up, boy, gon' bang it up, bang it up
Don't talk about it boy be about it
If you got it we can see about it shorty what's up
Bang it up, boy, gon' bang it up
I'm full grown now you can go tear it up, bang it up
Bang it up, boy, gon' bang it up
Last one I had on the floor couldn't do nothing, bang it up
Bang it up, boy, gon' bang it up, bang it up
Bang it up, boy, gon' bang it up, bang it up
Don't talk about it boy be about it
If you got it we can see about it shorty what's up
And you know you got it
Say you act upon it
Bring it on you, bang it
Say you act upon it
Bang it, bang it, bang it up
Bang it, bang it, bang it up
Bang it, bang it, bang it up
Bang it, bang it, bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang
