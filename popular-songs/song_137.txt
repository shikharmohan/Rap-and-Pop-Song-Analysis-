Got it all figured out inside of my head
There's a bag packed up at the foot of my bed
You say the word, baby, I'm all set
We'll cover our tracks, tell a couple white lies
Make sure we got a good alibi
And by the time they catch on we'll be outta their sight
Long gone, baby
Let's get out of this town tonight
Nothin' but dust in the shadows
Gone by mornin' light
Somewhere we won't ever get caught
Ever be found
Baby, let's just get out of this town
Don't need directions, don't need a map
If we get lost I'll be good with that
Yeah, we'll find a way to make the time pass
Windows rolled down with the heat on high
Stars all aligned in a runaway sky
Holdin' my hand as the miles roll by
Long gone, baby
Let's get out of this town tonight
Nothin' but dust in the shadows
Gone by mornin' light
Somewhere we won't ever get caught
Ever be found
Baby, let's just get out of this town
If we leave tonight and drive fast enough
All our troubles will be just like us
Long gone, baby
Let's get out of this town tonight
Nothin' but dust in the shadows
Gone by mornin' light
Somewhere we won't ever get caught
Ever be found
Yeah, let's get out of this town tonight
Let's get out of this town tonight
Yeah, we won't ever get caught
Ever be found
Baby, let's just get out of this town
