Another day has almost come and gone
Can't imagine what else could go wrong
Sometimes I'd like to hide away somewhere and lock the door
A single battle lost but not the war
'Cause, tomorrow's another day
And I'm thirsty anyway
So bring on the rain
It's almost like the hard times circle 'round
A couple drops and they all start coming down
Yeah, I might feel defeated and I might hang my head
I might be barely breathing but I'm not dead, no
'Cause, tomorrow's another day
And I'm thirsty anyway
So bring on the rain, ooh
I'm not gonna let it get me down
I'm not gonna cry
And I'm not gonna lose any sleep tonight
'Cause, tomorrow's another day
And I'm thirsty anyway
So bring on the rain
'Cause, tomorrow's another day
And I'm thirsty anyway
So bring on the rain, ooh
Bring on, bring on the rain
No I'm not gonna let it get me down
I'm not gonna cry
So bring on the rain, ooh
Bring on, bring on the rain
Bring on the rain
Bring on the rain, ooh
