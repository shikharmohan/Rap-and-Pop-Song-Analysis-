Same old bedroom floor
Same old empty sheets
I hate this haunted bed
So down here's where I sleep
And tryin' to find a place
To hide what you have left
Some things never change
My heart hasn't yet
Well, I don't wanna go out tonight
Yeah, but I can't be alone
Standing underneath this broke streetlight
Can't somebody take me home?
Can't somebody take me home?
The hope that we had left
Wrapped around your ring
That river just rolled on by
When I watched it sink
Well, I don't wanna go out tonight
Yeah, but I can't be alone
Standing underneath this broke streetlight
Can't somebody take me home?
Can't somebody take me
Out of this bar, out of this heartache
Out of this town that just keeps breakin' down
Keeps breakin' down?
Well, I don't wanna go out tonight
Yeah, but I can't be alone
Standing underneath this broke streetlight
Can't somebody take me home?
Well, I don't wanna go out tonight
Yeah, but I can't be alone
Standing underneath this broke streetlight
Can't somebody take me home?
Can't somebody take me home?
Won't you take me home?
