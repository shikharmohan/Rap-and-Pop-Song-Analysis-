[Intro]: 
(Bronx!) 
Boogie down 
You know who this is (Yeah) 
On the six, uptown 
[Verse I]: 
Me and, my girls 
Ready to rock the party 
Slide in, the club 
Pickin' up everybody 
Places hoppin' and jumpin' 
(censored) they got the new jam bumpin' (Yeah) 
It's on and crackin' tonight, yeah 
[Hook]: 
I stepped into another world (Another world) 
As soon as I start to dance (Yeah) 
Out on the floor 
It's always been the only place (Only place) 
When I'm looking to escape 
Baby you can do the same 
[Chorus]: 
Let your troubles go 
Baby, let it flow 
Just let who you are really show 
You need to take your time 
Play your part with mine 
It'll all be fine 
Let your troubles go 
[Hook 2]: 
Party people get your hands up (Yeah) 
Get your hands up, baby 
Party people get your hands up 
Get your hands up 
[Verse II]: 
Sweatin', grindin' 
Gettin' packed but I really don't mind it 
To wait, and then the heat is just getting started as I, bounce 
I'm drivin' all the players crazy as I, bounce 
I'm doin' it just for me 
[Hook]: 
I stepped into another world (Another world) 
As soon as I start to dance 
Out on the floor 
It's always been the only place (Only place) 
When I'm looking to escape 
Baby you can do the same 
[Chorus]: 
Let your troubles go 
Baby let it flow 
Just let who you are really show (Really show) 
You need to take your time 
Play your part with mine 
It'll all be fine 
Let your troubles go 
[Hook 3]: 
Party people get your hands up (Yeah) 
Get your hands up (Oh, oh) 
Party people get your hands up (Get your hands up) 
Get your hands up 
[Hook]: 
I stepped into another world (Step into another world) 
As soon as I start to dance (Out on the floor) 
Out on the floor 
It's always been the only place (Oh...) 
When I'm looking to escape (To escape, yeah) 
Baby you can do the same (You can do the same) 
[Chorus]: 
Let your troubles go 
Baby let it flow 
Just let who you are really show (Really show) 
You need to take your time 
Play your part with mine (Flow, the flow) 
It'll all be fine 
Let your troubles go
