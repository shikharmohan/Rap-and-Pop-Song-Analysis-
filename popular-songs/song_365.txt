All the noise and the voices are screaming what they have to say
And the headlines and sound bites are giving me demons to hate
And the man on TV, he tells me it's ugly
But if you ask me
It's a beautiful world
It's a beautiful world
Ooh, there's tears and there's fears and there's losses and crosses to bear
And sometimes the best we can do is just to whisper a prayer
Then press on because there's so much to live for
And so much to love
In this beautiful world
Say what you will but I still believe
It's a beautiful world
It's a beautiful world
And I know I'm not dreaming
I just choose to believe it
So I hate that I sometimes miss what's right in front of my eyes, oh
And I know at the end of my road I'll be wanting more time
Just another sunset, one more kiss from my baby
A smile from my friend
In this beautiful world
It's a beautiful world
Yeah, it's a beautiful world
Say what you will but I still believe
It's a beautiful world
Yeah, it's a beautiful world
Oh, it's a beautiful world
