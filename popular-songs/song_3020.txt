If only I'd have thought to send you roses
For no reason just to send you roses
And if only I'd thought to say more often I love you
But I just assumed you knew
And if only I'd have tried a little harder
If only we'd have talked a little more
If only I'd have held you closer
Then maybe I'd be holding you tonight
If only you, if only I
The saddest words are not goodbye
They're if only
If only we hadn't just pretended
There was nothing wrong it might not have ended
And if only we'd have given more attention
To the small things we might have it all today
If only I'd have tried a little harder
If only we'd have talked a little more
If only I'd have held you closer
Then maybe I'd be holding you tonight
If only you, if only I
The saddest words are not goodbye
They're if only
Instead of silence
There'd been angry words
If we had only listened
We just might have held our hearts
If only I'd have held you closer
Then maybe I'd be holding you tonight
If only you, if only I
The saddest words are not goodbye
They're if only
