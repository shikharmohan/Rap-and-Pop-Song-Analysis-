Every time I need love I run to you
I run straight to you, because your love is true
Girl, nobody else can make me feel the way you do
Because the way you do, your love is true
Oh girl and that's the truth
I like the way you touch me, I like the way it feels
I'm glad that we're together and this here feels so real
Nobody ever told that it could feel like this
That I can find heaven, heaven with a kiss
Who ever knew you were the one, that is no doubt
You're what my momma was talkin' bout
Oh baby girl you got me
Every time I need some love I run to you
(For you)
I run straight to you, because your love is true
Girl, nobody else can make me feel the way you do
(You got me runnin' for you)
Because the way you do, your love is true
Oh girl and that's the truth
Oh damn I'm so addicted, addicted to you girl
Sometimes it even scares me because you've become my world
People think I'm crazy, sayin' I'm in to deep
It's more that meets the eye, that they could ever see, yea
Who ever knew that you were the one, that is no doubt
You're what my momma was talkin' 'bout
(Talkin' about)
Oh baby girl you got me
Every time I turn around I run to you
(Every time I turn around)
I run straight to you
(Fallin' in love)
Because your love is true
(Woah yea)
Girl, nobody else can make me feel the way you do
(Every time I need some love, you're right there)
Because the way you do, your love is true
(Oh, girl and that's the truth)
Oh girl, Aye
Every time I need some love I run to you
I run straight to you, because your love is true
(Oh girl and that's the truth)
Every time I turn around
Oh you're right there, oh' you right there, you pretty girl
(So fine)
Every time I need some love I run to you
(Oh, girl and that's the truth)
