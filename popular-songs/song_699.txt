Oh yes
Yes I did baby, yes I did
It's funny 'cause for a while I walked around with a smile
But deep inside I could hear voices telling me this ain't right
Don't you know it's not for you? I always knew what I had to do
But it's hard to get away 'cause I love you, I just tried to stay
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright
I said I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And that voice inside says, "I'm gonna be alright"
Friends of mine say to me, they say you got control over me
You're not alone, I played my part, I saw the way you were from the start
Could I expect so much from you? You had a girl when I first met you
Did the best that you could do, now I realize that I can't change you
I used to say, I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright
I said I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And that voice inside says, "I'm gonna be alright"
Said, "I wouldn't walk away", somedays I want to stay
But leaving you is what I need to do to be okay
Never thought it would be true, me livin' without you
But now it's time for me to make that move, oh
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright
I said I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And that voice inside says, "I'm gonna be alright"
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright
I said I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And that voice inside says, "I'm gonna be alright"
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright
I said I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And that voice inside says, "I'm gonna be alright"
