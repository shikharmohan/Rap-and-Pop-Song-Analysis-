Is a big, big world
It's easy to get lost, baby
You've always been my girl
And I'm not ready to go like this
We make the sun shine in the moonlight
We can make the gray clouds turn to blue skies
I know it's hard, baby, believe me
That we can't go nowhere but up
From here, my dear
Baby, we can go nowhere but up
Tell me what we got to fear
We are taking to the sky, pass the moon to the galaxy
As long as you're with me, baby
Honestly with the strength of our love
We can go nowhere but up
It's a big, big world
And I'm gonna show you all of it
I'm gonna leash you with pearls, oh
From every ocean that we're swimming in
We make the sun shine in the moonlight
We can make the gray clouds turn to blue skies
Yeah, I know it's hard, baby, believe me, oh
That we can't go nowhere but up
From here, my dear
Baby, we can go nowhere but up
Tell me what we got to fear, whoa
We are taking to the sky, pass the moon to the galaxies
As long as you are with me, baby
Honestly with the strength of our love
We can go nowhere but up
Nowhere but
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Nowhere but
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Baby, we were underground
We are on the surface now
We are gonna make it girl
I promise
If you believe in love
And you believe in us
We can't go nowhere but up
Yeah, yeah
That we can nowhere but up
From here, my dear
Baby, we can go nowhere but up
Tell me what we got to fear
We are taking to the sky, pass the moon to the galaxies
As long as you are with me, baby
Honestly with the strength of our love
We can go nowhere but up
Nowhere but up
Nowhere but up
Whoa, nowhere but up
Oh, whoa, whoa
Yeah, nowhere but up whoa, whoa
Yeah
