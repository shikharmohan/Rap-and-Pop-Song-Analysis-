We had a fight, a lover's quarrel
Angry words spoken in haste
Deep in the night, it went out of control
And with tears streaming down my face
I slammed the door and I walked out
Swearing that we were through
Well, now I'm sitting in a bar, thinking I've gone too far
And wondering what I'm gonna do
Thinking about calling you
To my left, blue collar
To my right, a high dollar man
Across the bar a smooth bartender
Who thinks I'm in the palm of his hand
Well, they buy me drinks
And light my cigarette
They're all wondering
Which one I'm gonna choose
Oh, my hand's on my glass
My second margarita
And my mind is on you
My mind is on you
Well, I ran away in a moment of weakness
I couldn't hold my own, I should stay
Because being together
Means more than who was right or wrong
And sitting in a room full of lonely faces
You're the only one I see
If you only knew, I was thinking of you
Would you come and rescue me
Maybe I should call and see
To my left, blue collar
To my right, a high dollar man
Across the bar, a smooth bartender
Who thinks I'm in the palm of his hand
Well, they buy me drinks
And light my cigarette
They're all wondering
Which one I'm gonna choose
Oh, my hand's on my glass
My third margarita
And my mind is on you
My mind is on you
I should have known I could never get along
Outside of your love
It's last call and I'm out of cigarettes
And they are all wondering what I'm gonna do
Oh, my hand's on the glass
It's my last margarita
And my mind is on you
My mind is on you
My mind is on you
