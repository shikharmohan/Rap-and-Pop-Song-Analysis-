No other love, no other touch
Gimme, gimme oh so much
Turn me on, turn me on
Won't you please get out of my head?
Get back into my bed now, come kiss me, come with me
'Cause I can't hardly sleep without you
Can't stop thinking 'bout you, girl, I want you, I need you
And I'm ready for love
And I'm ready for us to lose control
Oh, you know and I know that
No other love, no other touch
Gimme, gimme oh so much
Turn me on, turn me on
No other kiss, no one like this
Feeling that I can't resist
Turn me on, turn me on, turn me on
I've had my share of lovers
But there is no other girl, you're special, now let's go
'Cause now I want you more than ever
Want to do whatever now to keep you, I need you
And I'm ready for love
I'm ready for us to lose control
Oh, you know and I know that
No other love, no other touch
Gimme, gimme oh so much
Turn me on, turn me on
No other kiss, no one like this
Feeling that I can't resist
Turn me on, turn me on, turn me on
I say your turning me on now
Say you're turning me, oh, oh, oh, on
Say you're turning me on with your smile
To you're lips, to the words of this song I know
I used to say I was too young, now I'm grown up
But I put you where you need that strong, real goodie good loving
Stevie Wonder said it's been so long
And I'mma a give it if you need it are you ready to receive it
Boy, I, I, I, I, I wanna give you some love
I wanna give you some love and affection
You got my attention
See I'm ready for love
I'm ready for us to lose control
Oh, you know and I know that
No other love, no other touch
Gimme, gimme oh so much
Turn me on, turn me on
No other kiss, no one like this
Feeling that I can't resist
Turn me on, turn me on, turn me on
