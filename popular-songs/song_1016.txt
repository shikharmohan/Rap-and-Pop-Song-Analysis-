I've been waiting my life
And I stayed on my grind
Now I made up my mind
It's been way too much time
That's why
  (It's just impossible)
It's impossible
And you know that
(It's impossible)
I don't wanna hear that bullsh**
I wanna hear that official sh**
Kanye and that Twista sh**
That's so impossible to get it
(It's just impossible)
Get it, that's so impossible to get it
Get it, that's so impossible to get it
(It's impossible)
Ain't no way you could pull up to the party in a Bentley
Blowing B in a club like this
(Oh no)
Ain't no way you could cook up in the studio with Kanye
And get it jukin' in the club like this
(Oh no)
(It's just impossible)
Ain't no way that you gon' win
Dust some haters off while I'm sippin' on my Hen
Holla at a chick while she sippin' on her gin
And I got the mobsters hollering at her friends
(It's impossible)
For you to ever be the nicest
You don't get gangsta or get righteous
You ain't neva stood on a tip like this
You ain't neva stood for no sh** like this
(It's just impossible)
For you to get it if you don't wanna win
Get up off yo' ass and go for yours and don't go for mine
No you ain't finna ride what I'm in
Know what I'm sayin'?
I've been waiting my life
And I stayed on my grind
Now I made up my mind
It's been way too much time
That's why
(It's impossible)
It's impossible
And you know that
(It's impossible)
I don't wanna hear that bullsh**
I wanna hear that official sh**
Kanye and that Twista sh**
That's so impossible to get it
(It's just impossible)
Get it, that's so impossible to get it
Get it, that's so impossible to get it
(It's impossible)
Get it bundled ***** up then, lit it
Smoke a lil' but don't admit it
Do it like I did, too late I did it
The controversy can't worse me man
I'm eating but I'm still thirsty and
Thirsty, what is you saying?
I gotta into a **** with a couple ******* last Thursday man
Why the hell is I'm worrying?
Hopping out the Benz with the perfect 10
Man, your life must be perfect man
Look at how they came up with the perfect plan
  (It's just impossible)
It's impossible
Got strip clubs playin' gosspital
Girl so sick in the hospital
You know I japped out like Pakadu
Ya know I throw ya down is when I rock wit you
Since Michael Jackson made "Rock With You"
I done did sh** on logical
Maybe 'cause we did the impossible
Maybe we done did the impossible
I've been waiting my life
And I stayed on my grind
Now I made up my mind
It's been way too much time
That's why
(It's impossible)
It's impossible
  (It's so impossible)
And you know that
(It's impossible)
I don't wanna hear that bullsh**
I wanna hear that official sh**
Kanye and that Twista sh**
That's so impossible to get it
(It's just impossible)
Get it, that's so impossible to get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it
That's so impossible to get it, get it
(It's impossible)
I don't wanna hear that bullsh**
I wanna hear that official sh**
Kanye and that Twista sh**
That's so impossible to get it
(It's just impossible)
Get it, that's so impossible to get it
Get it, that's so impossible to get it
(It's impossible)
(It's just impossible)
It's impossible
