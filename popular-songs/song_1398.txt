His old man was a rebel yeller, bad boy to the bone
He'd say, "Can't trust a colored feller"
He'd judge 'em by the tone of their skin
He was raised to think like his dad, narrow minded full of hate
On the road to nowhere fast, till the grace of God got in the way
Then he saw the light and hit his knees and cried and said a prayer
Rose up a brand new man and left the old one right there
Here's to the strong, thanks to the brave
Don't give up hope, some people change
Against all odds, against the grain
Love finds a way, some people change
She was born with her mother's habit
Guess you could say it's in her blood
She hates it that she's got to have it
She fills her glass up, and she'd love to kill that bottle
But all she can think about is a better life, a second chance
And everyone she's lettin' down, she throws that bottle down
Here's to the strong, thanks to the brave
Don't give up hope, some people change
Against all odds, against the grain
Love finds a way, some people change
Thank God to those who make it
Let them be the light
(Some people change)
Here's to the strong, thanks to the brave
Don't give up hope, some people change
Against all odds, against the grain
Love finds a way, some people change
Some people change, some people change
