You know the cards are stacked against this
As we surrender our defenses
And I've torn down all my fences just for you
And you feel it too what do we do, do we run or see it through?
The longer we're together it just keeps gettin' better
And you hide your little love letters around the house for me
And it's plain to see that you'll always be all I'll ever need
The webs we spun wove into one and left us tangled up in love
You squeeze my hand I understand about a woman and a man
I love the way you make me feel
You got me tangled up in love
The webs we spun wove into one left us tangled up in love
The longer we're together it just keeps gettin' better
And you hide your little love letters around the house for me
And it's plain to see that you'll always be all I'll ever need
The webs we spun wove into one and left us tangled up in love
