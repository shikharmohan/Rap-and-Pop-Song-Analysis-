It always feels like love to me
In the beginning
My mind is just a mirror of the way
My heart wants it to be
I hope to see everything in his eyes
'Cause that's where it starts with the truth and the lies
And I cannot hide my emotions
You cannot hide your intentions from me
Don't you think what I'm saying is
That's just the way it is, that's just the way it is
Not everything is what you say it is
That's just the way it is, the way it is, the way it is
And everything you do to me, it'll be done to you
And everything I put you through, well then I'll go through
But I'm willing to take that chance
But this type of romance is special, baby
I always look for love to be so exciting
But you can't force it, I'ma find it
In reality chemistry is everything
Don't you think what I'm saying is
That's just the way it is, that's just the way it is
Not everything is what you say it is
That's just the way it is, the way it is, the way it is
Don't you think what I'm saying is
That's just the way it is, that's just the way it is
Not everything is what you say it is
That's just the way it is, the way it is, the way it is
What your perception is of our connection is
Simply perfection and it's the same thing
If you're accepting it then I'm accepting it
Simply perfection and it's just the same thing
Don't you think what I'm saying is
That's just the way it is, that's just the way it is
Not everything is what you say it is
That's just the way it is, the way it is, the way it is
Don't you think what I'm saying is
That's just the way it is, that's just the way it is
Not everything is what you say it is
That's just the way it is, the way it is, the way it is
Don't you think what I'm saying is
That's just the way it is, that's just the way it is
Not everything is what you say it is
That's just the way it is, the way it is, the way it is
