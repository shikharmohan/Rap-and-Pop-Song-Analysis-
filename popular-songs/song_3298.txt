[Verse 1 - Tech N9ne]
Wake up in the morning with my betta half (Chaa)
On a boat lift the covers and I pet her ass (Chaa)
Never know when I gotta go cuz my life is impossible
The way I'm living the good things never last (Chaa)
So I live for the minute just want to start to begin it
When I wake up again I'm on stage rockin
20,000 people they yellin feedin my ego
When it's over the groupies they wanna know what's poppin
00N9na, known for dippin
From place to place I gotta vacate the mission
Gotta get the money but wudda ya know I wake up in a movie theater with my little ones on a big one
Hollywood movie with the Jackass cats
I close my eyes I open em and I'm back at rap
In the studio collabin killin wack ass crap
But then in a blink I wake up and pack that strap
In the club cuz some other niggas want my head
I don't know too much about em but they wont buy red
I ain't trippin don't wanna let the killas in blue start me
Wake up again I'm a DJ Clue party
With Diddy and Jim Jones, Juele and Rick Ross, Cat Fay, Trey Songz and Drake this is boss
Amazing
Lifes hella crazy livin like I'm a cuatro, triple, double agent
[Chorus - Tech N9ne]
00N9na
Where I'm bout to go I dont even know
00N9na
In a place where almost anything goes
00N9na
Many roads when I travel is what I chose
00N9na
Where I'm living I really got to many roads
[Verse 2 - Tech N9ne]
Me had a lot of women but dem need me (Chaa)
Wake up tryin to hide it but sin sees me (Chaa)
Overseas nigga tryna begin freaky (Chaa)
Wake up at the award at MTV (Chaa) U
Then I stab it at you, wake up I'm back at Missou and I get to mackin a few
After the yak I take em back to the sack and I screw
Scat then back to the lab I got some rappin to do
Then I wake up again I'm on stage at Paid Dues (Chaa)
This characteristic is made to slay crews (Chaa)
Some tryna get at me to battle but they lose (Chaa)
Then I'm wakin up with my kids on a pain cruise (Chaa)
They callin me daddy, wake up in a strip club they callin me daddy
Man I'm goin hella baddy
Amazing
Lifes hella crazy livin like I'm a cuatro, triple, double agent
[Chorus - Tech N9ne]
00N9na
Where I'm bout to go I dont even know
00N9na
In a place where almost anything goes
00N9na
Many roads when I travel is what I chose
00N9na
Where I'm living I really got to many roads
[Verse 3 - Tech N9ne]
At any rate I'm all over the place
Music and being a father and I know that I made
Got me feelin moon stricken but N9n remain calm (Chaa)
Livin like I'm out of a scene from James Bond (Chaa)
Switching (Chaa) Changin (Chaa) Feelin (Chaa) Strangin (Chaa)
Living multiple lifes robbin and gangbangin (Chaa)
Freakin all over the world Middle West swangin (Chaa)
Always on the move ain't neva time for hangin
Slick with my shit my grip don't fold (Chaa)
Pick the fly chicks and ditch those hoes (Chaa)
Kiss for my bitch my kids get doe (Chaa)
Rip in my scripts I hits this road (Chaa)
00N9ne nigga I love this grind (Chaa)
Doing a lot of good and mud this time
Dippin all over the planet tellin the bitches my name is N9ne
EHR!
Tech N9ne!
[Chorus - Tech N9ne]
00N9na
Where I'm bout to go I dont even know
00N9na
In a place where almost anything goes
00N9na
Many roads when I travel is what I chose
00N9na
Where I'm living I really got to many roads
