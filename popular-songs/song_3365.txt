Mister can you take me into little rock
I'll buy the coffee and I'll fill your truck
I'll listen all night if you wanna talk
Just don't mention Memphis
And we can talk about your family
Politics, music and philosophy
Any ol' subject's alright with me
Just don't mention Memphis
Or blue eyes, and light brown hair
An angel waving to me from the top of the stairs
The hardest thing I did was leave her standing there
So don't mention Memphis
Pass me the thermos and I'll fill your cup
We'll make Texas with a little luck
And I'm hanging with you till the sun comes up
So don't mention Memphis
Or blue eyes and light brown hair
An angel waving to me from the top of the stairs
The hardest thing I did was leave her standing there
So don't mention Memphis
I don't wanna talk about Memphis
And the hardest thing I did was leave my baby there
So don't mention Memphis
I don't wanna talk about Memphis
