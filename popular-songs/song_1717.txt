Dust it off, break it down
Get to what we're talkin about
Do what we're talkin about
Don't try to hide it now
Why keep on working it out?
You keep on working it out
'Cause I see how it's putting you down
I just can't be around
What you doing this for?
'Cause the light in you started to fade
Don't let it get away
Girl you're worth so much more
Don't waste the pretty on him
Don't waste the pretty on pain
When it gets too much to take
Don't give it away
Don't waste the pretty on life
Soon it's gonna fly on by
Whatever way you got to see
Don't waste the pretty
Sit back and breath it in
Look at how lucky we are
Look at how lucky we are
This life we're livin in
You got to follow your heart
You know I'm never too far
Away from the pain in your eyes
I can see your disguise
But it's not too late
'Cause I know you can turn it around
Don't let it get you down
Don't be scared, work it out
And listen when I say
Don't waste the pretty on him
Don't waste the pretty on pain
When it gets too much to take
Don't give it away
Don't waste the pretty on life
Soon it's gonna fly on by
Whatever way you got to see
Don't waste the pretty
And just incase you need reminding
Well you're beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
And every noticed sin, you hide it
'Cause you're beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Don't waste the pretty on him
Don't waste the pretty on pain
When it gets too much to take
Don't give it away
Don't waste the pretty on life
Soon it's gonna fly on by
Whatever way you got to see
Don't waste the pretty
Don't waste the pretty
Don't waste the pretty
Don't, don't waste the pretty
Don't waste the pretty
Don't waste the pretty
Don't , don't waste the pretty
Don't waste the pretty
Don't waste the pretty
(Yeah you're beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful)
Don't waste the pretty
Don't waste the pretty
Don't, don't waste the pretty
Don't waste the pretty
Don't waste the pretty
Don't , don't waste the pretty
Don't waste the pretty
Don't waste the pretty
