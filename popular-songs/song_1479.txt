Everybody says, It's going to take a little time
Might as well get used to her running through my mind
Her memory brought me to my knees when will I be back up walking
Only time will tell but it ain't talking
Lot of sleepless nights I'm sure are lying up ahead
Wondering when the night will come when I lay down in bed
And her memory finally decides to stop calling
Only time will tell but it ain't talking
Only time will tell when I will finally be free
But so far it hasn't spoken a single word to me
Wonder when the pain will end and all the tears will stop falling
Only time will tell, but it ain't talking
Only time will tell when I will finally be free
But so far it hasn't spoken a single word to me
Wonder when the pain will end and all the tears will stop falling
Only time will tell, but it ain't talking
Only time will tell, but it ain't talking
