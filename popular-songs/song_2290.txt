Damn (damn, yepp)

like it happens, alright? 
Omarion, Bow wow, I'm tryna! part 2 
BOW WOW
Damn, so this is how it's going down 
me and you ain't talking now 
what about everything we've been thru 
you just gon' go throw all this out? 
what about the good times we did have 
harder times that I made you laugh 
what about the times when I cheered you up 
when u was hurt and u was sad

OMARION
Seems like yesterday you were my woman 
shopping malls and holidays could'nt tell us nothing 
now you're all up in my house wit another brother 
and I'm thinking to myself I'm out to kill this motherfucker 
and I say girl I'm sorry, even though I know it's late for apologies 
babe how could you do this to me, you was supposed to have my baby 
I'm tryna act like I don't wanna be with you, 
like I would be ok if you just walked away 
I'm tryna act like I don't wanna see you 
like you was just a phase, I forget you in a couple of days 
tryna act like I can do without feeling on yo booty 
find another ghetto cutie, to do me like you do me baby 
girl I'm just so addicted to you, 
Imma try but I can't, cause you're all I'm tryna do 
yeah yeah 
I see you here and there with your friends and I start that frontin' 
act like I've been doin' my thing and I don't need your lovin' 
but I see it in your eyes girl you want me back, 
and I give anything just to have you back 
memories that you got you're my homie, 
I don't know what to do, you confuse me 
girl this is crazy you're supposed to have my baby 
I'm tryna act like I don't wanna be with you, 
like I would be ok if you just walked away 
I'm tryna act like I don't wanna see you (see you) 
like you was just a phase, I forget you in a couple of days 
(couple of days) 
tryna act like I can do without feeling on yo booty 
find another ghettocutie, to do me like you do me 
yeah yeah yeah girl I'm just so addicted to you, 
Imma try but I can't, cause you're all I'm tryna do 
Bow wow: 
Yeah, I've done a lot of things wrong, 
but I guess that's something I gotta live with 
If I could then I would turn back the hands of time girl 
I would'nt ever have did this 
I guess what they say is true, you don't know what you got until it's gone 
now I'm sitting here all alone, wishing that's she'll come back home 
but she ain't coming back, homie ain't no cure for that 
a woman can take so much and once it get to that point, she gone like that 
I'm tryna be the best I can, I'm tryna be a better man 
I'm tryna act like I don't wanna be with you, 
like I would be ok if you just walked away 
I'm tryna act like I don't wanna see you (I don't wanna see you girl) 
like you was just a phase, I forget you in a couple of days 
(forget you in a couple of days) 
tryna act like I can do without feeling on yo booty 
find another ghettocutie, to do me like you do me 
yeah yeah yeah girl I'm just so addicted to you, 
Imma try but I can't cause you're all I'm tryna do.. 
ah, yeah..
