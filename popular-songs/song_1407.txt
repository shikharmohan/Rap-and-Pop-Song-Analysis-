Well, I opened my heart and I let you in
I promised, I'd never love again
And still doin' what I'd said I'd do
Someday I might get over you
Well, I wear my ring on a chain now instead of my hand
And I deal with your memories the best I can
And I've even been out on a date or two
Someday I might get over you
Oh, I never thought I'd see it
But I think I see the light now
I know that what I have to do
Is to get on with my life
But I can't fake another day
I can't face another night
So I just take another breath
And let it go
If I could ever feel the way I felt
Well, I'll take a chance with someone else
And if my heart takes chances too
Someday I might get over you
Oh, I never thought I'd see it
But I think I see the light now
I know that what I have to do
Is get on with my life
But I can't fake another day
I can't face another night
So I just take another breath
And let it go
Well, I opened my heart and I let you in
I promised I'd never love again
Right now it's somethin' I still can't do
Someday I might get over you
Though it may not be till my life is through
Someday I might get over you
