__________
Everybody wana get in the middle of mu life
Wanna know about the nina, the women, and my wife
Hell of rumors I get enough of the haters you can bet they gona do it till I die
What I do up in the crilla for realla is my right
Get the women up and flip it then stick it, it's my night
Everybody lookin' at me like I'm a killer, but never lookin' tech up in the eye
Zing zing zing, and a one, two, three
Why the negative energy gotta come through me (me me)
Teccanina doin' this, he doin' that, stingin' the women like a bumble bee (bee bee)
Don't believe everything you hearin' up in the streets, capiche?
Don't ever rack your brain (brain brain)
Tech N9ne, Lyrycyst well if the gift lifts to this, we're gonna break them chains
Lyricist:
_______
What you talkin' about this gossip stop it, drop it
Cause we'll prosper, profit, mark us
But you cannot stop us
or lock us in shackles with lockets
We are no novice can't contain us
We will rock this 
cause we rap so futuristic like we were taught by spacely sprockets you got it
Anybody wana test this, I'm restless I'll eat ya'll, for breakfast
No weapons, just music in my presence
No peasants, you rappers can't touch this, I'm badder
And I'm tellin' all your chadders, I'm not your average cracker
Your lack of, innovation, makes your music a displacement
To the way rappers intended so how can you talk offensive
Your a product for the jingles, you're a hot wheel I'm a diesel
Get some musical talent before you speak of ma people
Chorus:
______
Cause lyricist has broke the chains, I'm out I broke the chains
Teccanina's broke the chains, I'm out I broke the chains
Lyricist has broke the chains, I'm out I broke the chains
Teccanina's broke the chains, I'm out I broke the chains !!
Lyricist:
_______
keep on livin' I don't need no more opinion
This is my time, I was given, and I wish people would just listen
Cuase I feel like Michael Jackson and just wana be left alone
Cause you standin' on ma garden, just step back and let it grow
Lyricist will never be tamed, gota maintain, and bring my reign
So no matter what they say, I'll entertain until I drain
And this name is a gift, I was raised with the tip
Don't refrain, and don't drift, they will praise lyricist
When I come, stepping to the pace of my drums 
Deep down, there's a sound, it's growin' rapidly and ready to come out
Bow down, to an righteous being molded from the hands of god
Me and Tech(2X Echo), N9ne(2X Echo), will make this planet rock!!
Common!!
Chorus:
______
Cause lyricist has broke the chains, I'm out I broke the chains
Teccanina's broke the chains, I'm out I broke the chains
Lyricist has broke the chains, I'm out I broke the chains
Teccanina's broke the chains, I'm out I broke the chains !!
Tech N9ne:

Hey everybody, hey everybody
Why I gotta lay everybody, spray everybody
With A.K to the body, may everybody
I don't get away with it, buddy, say don't they know I'm way naughty 
Shake the lame and break the chains
Don't hate the player, but hate the game
Ama quake the frame
I will never ever take the shame
Everybody body wanna create the pain
Tech N9ne, Lyricist, how could rhyme give us this
He say she say, we say he gay, but they dyin' to hear us spit
Everywhere I go, everywhere I flow
It seems to be rumors all around me
Everywhere I show, people in my bia, but see I
disregard demons who down me, broke[/QUOTE]
