I'll never forget that night long ago
When he drove me down that old dusty road
He took me as far as I'd ever been
He wanted me and I wanted him
But I'd always been told, I shouldn't give in
I wouldn't go that far
I didn't follow my heart
He said, he loved me
But I wasn't ready
And I wouldn't go that far
He was so patient, he didn't give up
With a ring in his hand and a heart full of love
He asked me for forever, I asked him to wait
To please understand, these dreams I must chase
Though it was a promise, I wanted to make
I wouldn't go that far
Oh, I didn't follow my heart
I knew he loved me
But I wasn't ready
And I wouldn't go that far
After all these years, I saw him again
He had his wife and his family with him
He said, he was proud of all my success
He guessed both of us had found happiness
But I wouldn't go that far
I didn't follow my heart
I knew he loved me
But I wasn't ready
I wouldn't go that far
Yes, I knew he loved me
But I wasn't ready
And I wouldn't go that far
