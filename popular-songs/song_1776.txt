I rode all night on a big old bus 
You came a long way to be w/ us 
You paid good money 
To see a show 
Ya, lets get ready 
Cuz here we go 
Get on your feet, cuz im plugged in 
So come on, let's do this 
I'll turn it on 
I'll turn it up 
I'll show you all what i'm made of 
I'll make it loud 
I'll wear it out 
I'll bring the roof in this house down 
I know just what you came here for 
And I want to hear you scream and more 
Get on your feet 
You know you can't resist

And the real party starts backstage 
And all my friends 
They sing my song

Could come along 
To take a picture 
To show your friends
