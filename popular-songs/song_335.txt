Cracked windshield has super glue
Crumpled up cans and a beat up bag of red man chew
Fix a flat, Jonny Cash box set
Half a dozen parking tickets that I ain't paid yet
 It's sittin' on that long bed seat
I got my shotgun girl right next to me
Four wheel turning two hearts burning we go running wild
I'm gonna make a million memories for every hundred thousand miles
Learning everything I'll ever need to know about life and love
In the cab of my truck
Slidin' rear back window
So it's an easy reach to where my cooler keeps them iced down cold
Roll of duck tape, WD 40
Ain't nothing too loose or locked too tight for a man like me
Yeah, I might take it slow, 30 through town
On a back dirt road, girl I put the hammer down
Four wheel turning two hearts burning we go running wild
I'm gonna make a million memories for every hundred thousand miles
Learning everything I'll ever need to know about life and love
In the cab of my truck
Down by the river, two bodies in the glow of the radio dial
I'm gonna make a million memories for every hundred thousand miles
I'm learning everything we'll ever need to know about life and love
In the cab of my truck, in the cab of my truck
Man I can't find anything in this truck
Oh, what's this? A little white tank top
Get out of my way Cadillac, big white's coming through
