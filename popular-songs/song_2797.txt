I've got a story to tell, would you mind listening
I can always count on you, we're such good friends
And I need to talk about my situation
And you're the only one who'll understand
Now someone's got designs on my baby
She's making her intentions very plain
We both know this ole gal that I'm talking about
But I don't want to mention any names
Well, she's asked him to slow dance way too often
She's made suggestions I don't like at all
I'm trying to let her know that I'm wise to her game
But I don't wanna mention any names
Well, now I can understand why she'd want him
Oh, you've even said yourself he's quite a prize
She's about a good of friend as you are
Come to think about it she's just about your size
If she don't back off, there's gonna be some trouble
Now I'm prepared to make that very plain
I sure hope I've said enough and just between the two of us
'Cause I don't want to mention any names
Well, she's asked him to slow dance way too often
She's made suggestions I don't like at all
I'm trying to let her know that I'm wise to her game
But I don't wanna mention any names
I'm trying to let her know that I'm wise to her game
But I don't wanna mention any names
