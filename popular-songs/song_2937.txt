There were no angry words at all as we carried boxes down the hall
One by one, we put them in your car
Nothing much for us to say, one last goodbye and you drove away
I watched your tail-lights as they faded in the dark
I couldn't face the night in that lonely bed
So I laid down on the couch instead
Last night I prayed the Lord, my soul to keep, then I cried myself to sleep
So sure life wouldn't go on without you
But, Lord, this sun is blinding me as it wakes me from the dark
I guess the world didn't stop for my broken heart
Clock still tickin', life goes on, radio still plays a song
As I try to put my scattered thoughts in place
And it takes all the strength I've got to stumble to the coffee pot
The first of many lonely mornings I've had to face
You call to see if I'm okay
I look out the window and I just say
Last night I prayed the Lord, my soul to keep, then I cried myself to sleep
So sure life wouldn't go on without you
But, Lord, this sun is blinding me as it wakes me from the dark
I guess the world didn't stop for my broken heart
Oh, I guess the world ain't gonna stop for my broken heart
