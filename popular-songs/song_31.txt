Big Big Sean
[Hook]
I go in
I go hard
(repeated)
If you really wanna talk about Good
I'm good
[Big Sean Verse 1]
Pressure, pain, ache, struggle
this is my hustle
but I do it for the life
the love, the lights, the glory
I rise more than juries this is my story
and hell yeah I'm going for the title
if your name is on the title than its finna get the white out
tell em throw it up for me
I'm going when it's dark out
endo with his light out
Im feeling like Mike now (damn)
and my shadow is the only thing I'm fearing
if I need to see my idol I just look up in the mirror
just think illogicial to me is illogical
so I took impossible and turned it into optical
see plus is like tears in the locker room
but you should take a look at where it got us to
you could never fathom all the sh-t I've been through or been to
a walking itch in my gym suit
[Hook]
[Pat Piff]
uh, celebrated, determination
life's a love song so dedicate it to the paper
my staple
the brown nose on your face gonna smell of vapours
finally famous
said that I've been with
I'm so old school but the flow newfangled
bicycle kick it yeah Im finna Liu Kang them
finsh em!
focus like (?) addiction
shit real but you got no chance
Im undefeated
but im a 100 proof and you's a margherita
Im a (?) what you teacher said until I got kicked off like sneaker heads
cause I was listening to beats instead of this white man
and all of his history lessons
I'm passing blunts in the bathroom
Pat Piff is absent, wood shop bitch
we carving out the classics
[Hook]
Im harder than you and you and you and you
Really wanna talk about I'm good!
