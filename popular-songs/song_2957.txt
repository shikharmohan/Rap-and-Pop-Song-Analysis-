Your letter found me here in Denver
I've changed though since I've been here
Now I've learned there's more to life
Than your promises
There's someone here in Colorado
I won't forget tomorrow
So you really better love me after this
On a bus somewhere in Kansas
Heading home to take my chances
Lord, I hope this time you mean
The things you say
I won't say this is the last time
And let you play with my mind
But you really better love me after this
'Cause after all the pain we've been through
After all the chances we blew
Doesn't really mean that much to you
Oh, you really better love me
As the bus pulls in the station
I can see you waiting
And I believe we both forget
What we can't forgive
Now we're holding to each other
I can feel my heart recover
And I know you're gonna love me after this
'Cause after all the pain we've been through
After all the chances we blew
I guess we really mean that much to you
Oh you're really gonna love me
Oh you're really gonna love me
Oh you're really gonna love me
