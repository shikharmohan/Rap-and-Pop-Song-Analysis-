Well I can't hide, no on the mantle
I'm not sad until I'm home
It's the season, I'm all reason
I have seen through all I have grown
Sheared at the seams
Cheat on me, cheat on me
Cheat on me, and not seen, and not seen
And not seen, cheat on me, at the seams
I'm a lender, I'm a planter
I said something in the garden
In the handle on the mantle
I met Santa and I met God
Sheared at the seams
Cheat on me, cheat on me
Cheat on me, cheat on me
At the seams, at the seams
At the seams, cheat on me
I'm a lady can you save me?
It's the sulfur, I have grown
'Tis the season, I'm all reason
I have fleas, so run on home
Sheared at the seams
Cheat on me, cheat on me, cheat on me
Cheat on me, cheat on me, cheat on me
At the seams, at the seams, cheat on me
