Some come for the music some for romance
You gotta be with the boy that brought you to the dance
Then across the room there comes a casual glance
And you be making some dime even half the chance
Now some like to look and some like to touch
All the things that they can't have way too much
Some like to get real close to the flame
Once you feel the heat you know they're never the same
Why do we want what we know we can't have
Why don't we want what's in the palm of our hands
Why we're always lookin' at what's just out of our grasp
Why do we want what we know we can't have

Well Susie was out drivin' her new Corvette
She hadn't made that second payment yet
She rear ended a Semi but not by choice she was a rubberneckin' a new Rolls Royce
Oh why do we want...
Yeah why do we want...
