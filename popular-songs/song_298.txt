50 Cent, Ciara
I'm focused man
You should know this man
Yes, one dose of me will have you addicted
To know me is to love me I handle my business
Any city any town, touch down I do my thing
I'ma hustler baby I provide by any means
I'ma great conversationalist, you should know what I'm about
When you look at me baby you should see a way out
Out the hood, out the drama, out the Bentley it's on
Out the headache and stress you done been through before
It's only been three months an I already got it bad
So hood that I keep on comin' back
My girlfriends tellin' me I don't know how to act
But I'm tellin' them baby bye fall back
He's so good and he knows how to love me
But so hood and he's so heavy in the streets
He's my dude and you betta get used to things
And I don't care what you say about me, they say
That he does it with the best, runs a lil' less
Tatted on his chest, I like it, so what, I like it
And they say that he's gonna hurt me, just wait and see
But they don't know me 'cause I am what he wants, his girl and I love it
I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that good boy game but the dope boy's turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone
I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that game but the dope boy's turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone
See when I had a good guy he didn't do that much for me
Tried to be hard but that he can neva be
Always tell me that no one could compared to me
But couldn't handle it when other guys was starin' at me
Now the time plays back so everyone could look at me
From the A to hills up in Beverly
He's so fly that he knows how to carry me
First class when they talk we don't hear what they say
That he does it with the best, runs it in the west
Tatted on his chest, I like it, so what, I like it
And they say that he's gonna hurt me, just wait and see
But they don't know me 'cause I am what he wants, his girl and I love it
I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that good boy game but the dope boy's turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone
I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that game but the dope boy's turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone
The more I get the more my ambition tell me there's more
I'll move a A for that girl, I'll move ahead for that boy
Then I flip that double up, kick back, cuddle up
Ya friends trying to confuse you but you know what?
My intentions are good, I can't help it I'm hood
I wouldn't change if I could, you shouldn't tell me I should
Baby you should take me as I am
And be happy you're my girl 'cause I'm happy I'm your man
I can hear your call, it just takes one call
I'll come running, boy I promise I will be there for you
All my heart it belongs to you
I can't lose you, yeah, boy I just can't leave you alone
I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that good boy game but the dope boy's turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone
I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that game but the dope boy's turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone
I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that good boy game but the dope boy's turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone
I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that game but the dope boy's turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone
