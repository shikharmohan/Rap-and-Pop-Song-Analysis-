Go go

Go go go
Turn the lights down low
Turn the lights down low
Ah, ah
Turn the lights down low
Turn the lights down low
Turn the lights down low
Turn the lights down low (low)
Turn the lights down low (low)
Turn the lights down low
(Verse One:)
(Ciara)
Everytime there's a break up
I feel I wake up
Everybody knows but,I feel the pain but
Ya'll don't really know about
I just can't be goin down
Who you think you talkin' down
Your the one that's goin down.
Everybody run and run
This what the pain does
I be just wanna 
To try somebody with this thing cause 
I can't make ya'll honest in me
I know some of ya'll gotta feel me.
(Pre Chorus:)
(Ciara)
I've been around the world
Just trying to be a girl 
I said ah shila, ah shila
And I know it's not because of me.
(Chorus)
(Ciara)
It ain't me (3x)
I said ooouuu it's gotta 
Be you (come on)(4x)
It ain't me (3x)
I said ooouuu it's gotta 
Be you,(2x) gotta be you, be you
(Verse two:)
(ciara)
I'm not makin' this ah, to climasate some
Ya'll the ones that blow it up
Swaying them do to much
People they will trade me
Only then they hate
I'm gettin' betta remember they ain't invade me.
Why you talkin' this ah
Soon i'm gettin' this what 
Who's sweet
Say it to my face ,you ain't show enough
Ya'll can't ever really even with me 
Cause the past is the only thing you'll see.
(Pre Chorus:)
(Ciara)
I've been around the world
(Been around the world)
Just trying to be a girl

I said ah shila, ah shila
And I know It's not because of me. 
(Chorus:)
(Ciara)
It ain't me (3x)

Be you (come on).(4x)
