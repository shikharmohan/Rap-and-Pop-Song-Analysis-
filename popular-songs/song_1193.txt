(Verse)
One Two Three Baby Don't think twice
Just like that you gotta brand new life
Hop in this truck and run through the red lights
Yeah where you wanna go baby name the town
We can go up north or head down south
Roll down the windows with the radios loud
Com'on turn it up, yeah
Start living your life
On the double leave your troubles behind
You knew we're gonna be alright
(Chorus)
You could be a black bird
On the country street
Hiding from the world from a broken wing
But you better believe you gonna fly with me
You could be a songbird from the New Orleans
Scared of the rain just cuz you're scared to sing
But you better believe you're gonna fly with me
(Verse)
Well, here we are baby in the back of my van
Suns going down skies turning red
Stars coming out
Baby look at you now
God know how long but its been a while
Since I heard you laugh and I'd seen that smile
Fill that kiss and I can get use to this
Baby I could get use to this
(chorus)
You gonna fly x 2
