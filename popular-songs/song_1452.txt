Summertime is finally here
That old ball park, man, is back in gear
Out on 49, man, I can see the lights
School's out, the nights roll in
Man, just like the long lost friend
You ain't seen in a while
You can't help but smile
And it's two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love in an old Ford
Cheap sherries and a tattoo
And Yoo-hoo bottle on the floorboard
Perfect song on the radio
Sing along 'cause it's one we know
It's a smile, it's a kiss
It's a simple wine, it's summertime
Sweet summertime
Temperature says 93
Down at the deposit can guarantee
But that swimming hole
It's nice and cold
Bikini bottoms underneath
But the boys' hearts still skip a beat
When them girls shimmy off
In them ol' cutoffs
And it's two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love in an old Ford
Cheap sherries and a tattoo
And Yoo-hoo bottle on the floorboard
Perfect song on the radio
Sing along 'cause it's one we know
It's a smile, it's a kiss
It's a simple wine, it's summertime
Sweet summertime
The more things change
The more they stay the same
Don't matter how old you are
When you know what I'm talking 'bout
Yeah baby, when you got
Two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love in an old Ford
Cheap sherries and a tattoo
And Yoo-hoo bottle rolling on the floorboard
Perfect song on the radio
Sing along 'cause it's one we know
It's a smile, it's a kiss
It's a simple wine, it's summertime
Sweet summertime
