Wake up, here I go, cram it all down my throat
Stomach's so full that I wish I could choke
Seven a.m., my head's already in a spin
As soon as I'm out that door
Bam, it hits me like a ton of those red bricks
Can't dig myself out of this highest ditch
This madness
I swear sometimes I can't tell
Which way's up, which way's down
It's all up in my face, need to push it away
Somebody push it away, so all that I can hear
Is a simple song, sing along now
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
Midday sun beating on the concrete
Burning up my feet, too many cars on the street
The noise, the red, the green, makes me wanna scream
Five o'clock now it's bumper on
Bumper on, bumper horns honking
Nobody's looking but everybody's talking
It's another day on this highway
I swear sometimes I can't tell
Which way's up, which way's down
It's all up in my face, need to push it away
Somebody push it away, 'cos all I wanna hear, oh
Is a simple song, sing along now
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, hey!
Sing along now
Sing along
What I'd give to turn it off
And make it stop, make it stop
You gotta make it stop, so all that I can hear
Is a simple song, sing along now
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, da, da, da
