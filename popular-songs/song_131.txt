This boy here wants to move too fast
He sees my future as havin' a past
Well, I don't think so
I don't think so
That boy there, well, he's playin' a fool
He thinks he's funny and he thinks he's cool
Well, I don't think so
I don't think so
Cheap date, bad taste, another night gone to waste
Talkin' about nothin' in so many words
It's not like I'm not tryin'
'Cause I'll give anyone a shot once
And I, I close my eyes
And I kiss that frog
Each time findin'
The more boys I meet
The more I love my dog
Here's this guy, thinks he's bad to the bone
He wants to pick me up and take me home
Well, I don't think so
I don't think so
Cage fights, PlayStation, X-Games and Raider Nation
Oversize pants with an ego to match
It's not like I'm not tryin'
'Cause I'll give anyone a shot once
And I, I close my eyes
And I kiss that frog
Each time findin'
The more boys I meet
The more I love my dog
Why can't they be like the ones
That mean everythin' to me?
Warm and loyal, open and friendly
It's not like I'm not tryin'
'Cause I'll give anyone a shot once
I close my eyes
And I kiss that frog
Each time findin'
The more boys I meet
The more I love my
I close my eyes
And I kiss that frog
Each time findin'
The more boys I meet
The more I love my dog
The more I love my dog
