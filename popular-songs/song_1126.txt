I'm on a red dirt road windin' up to a sky of blue
And I left the blacktop back about a mile or two
No more sittin' at home leave the TV and the telephone far behind
This life is killin' us all and back roads are lookin' mighty fine
Oh, and
Freedom's finally mine
I ain't takin' anymore
Yeah freedom's finally mine, it's finally mine
  (I ain't takin' anymore)
Oh, freedom's finally mine
I'd like to throw out this cellular and kick off these shop-shined shoes
Leave the kids at your mama's and take off to Timbuktu
So give me two sets of mud-grip tracks, leadin' off to way out back o' yonder
There's no mountain I can't climb to satisfy this need of mine to wander
Oh, 'cause
Freedom's finally mine
  (I ain't takin' anymore)
Yeah freedom's finally mine, it's finally mine
  (I ain't takin' anymore)
Oh, freedom's finally mine
There's no desert I can't cross
No river too wide
I can do what I want now
'Cause freedom's finally mine yeah
Oh freedom
Freedom's finally mine
  (I ain't takin' anymore)
Yeah freedom's finally mine, it's finally mine
  (I ain't takin' anymore)
Oh, freedom's finally mine
Yes mine
It's finally mine
Yeah it's mine
Oh give it to me
Oh freedom
