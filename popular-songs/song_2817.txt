How do two people like us ever happen to meet
I think about that
Was the timing just right was it that the night was so sweet
I think about that
Was it chemical physical what was the deal
Or did some kind of magic turn out to be real
Might be how you kiss and hold me tight
When we're walkin' honey underneath the moonlight
Might be how it keeps on gettin' better
We haven't even talked about forever
I just know that we're so good together
When did we cross that line and just happen to find we're in love
I think about that
Was it you was it me who could see we'd turn out to be us
I think about that
We could spend all our time tryin' to figure it out
And not be any closer than we are right now
Might be how you kiss and hold me tight
When we're walkin' honey underneath the moonlight
Might be how it keeps on gettin' better?
We haven't even talked about forever
I just know that we're so good together
Might be how you kiss and hold me tight
When we're walkin' honey underneath the moonlight
Might be how it keeps on gettin' better
We haven't even talked about forever
We [Incomprehensible] ever baby forever
I just know that we're so good together, ohh baby
Oh, so good together
So good together
So good together
So good together
So good together
So good together
So good together
So good together
So good together
