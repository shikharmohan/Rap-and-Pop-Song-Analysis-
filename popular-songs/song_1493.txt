You know the restaurant on Highway 1
With the key lime pie, that song, sand and the sun
Where we ran in our bare feet, built a castle on the beach
Just the wind, the rocks, the waves and you and me
And I can't go there 'cause that's just too much us
I can't go there and I still feel your touch
There's places in my heart and head that feel as empty as our bed
So most nights I don't even walk upstairs 'cause I can't go there
Remember San Francisco on that cable car
Our reflection in the window of that store
How we danced the night away with the lights down on the bay
And wound up in a blanket on the floor
And I can't go there 'cause 'Friscos too much us
I can't go there and I still feel your touch
Now there's places in my heart and head that still feel as empty as our bed
So most nights I dont even walk upstairs 'cause I can't go there
If it was only Florida or California
Maybe I could let myself move on
But it's everywhere we've been and everywhere I turn
And I can't love again because I've learned
That I can't go there, it's somethin' I can't do
I can't go there, I'll run into you and I can't go there
When the sun shines, when it rains, Christmas parties, football games
  (I can't go there)
Winter, summer, fall or spring, I see you in everything
  (I can't go there)
It's too much us, I can't go there
