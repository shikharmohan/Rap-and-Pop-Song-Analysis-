Bartenders, barstools, and barmaids
A jukebox and a pocket full of change
Just a few of my favorite things
Bartenders, barstools, and barmaids
Bartenders will listen when you talk
And barstools are there when you can't walk
And I'll always make a waitress my best friend
Until the music stops and closin' time begins
Bartenders, barstools, and barmaids
A jukebox and a pocket full of change
Just a few of my favorite things
Bartenders, barstools, and barmaids
Outside lies a heart that's been broke
But in here it's a world of song and smoke
That way my eyes and ears can lie to me
While I drink another shot of make believe
Bartenders, barstools, and barmaids
A jukebox and a pocket full of change
Just a few of my favorite things
Bartenders, barstools, and barmaids
Bartenders, barstools, and barmaids
