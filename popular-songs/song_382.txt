Take your suitcase and take your heart
Take a train to the boulevard
My love will follow you, my love will follow you
You can try to lose yourself downtown
You can burn all your bridges down
My love will follow you, yeah my love will follow you
[chorus]
My love will follow you
Down every highway of your soul
You can leave me far behind
But my love will be your shadow 
Everywhere you go
So close the door, turn in the key
Leave me here like a memory
My love will follow you, my love will follow you
Even on a road that takes you down where
Cords of human kindness come unwound
My love will follow you, yeah my love will follow you 
[chorus]
If you should go so far, that you cannot get back
Girl, you may not remember, but my heart will not lose track
So go ahead and take that train
In my heart you'll still remain
My love will follow you, my love will follow you
My love will follow you
Oh, follow you
My love will follow you
