Well I drank 'til I stumbled
And I drank 'til I fell
When the drunk part was over it hurt me like hell
And I know about drinkin'
So I know one thing's true
Being drunk's a lot like lovin' you
'Cause I loved 'til I stumbled
I loved 'til I fell
When the lovin' was over it hurt me like hell
And I know what a taste of the wrong love can do
Bein' drunk's a lot like lovin' you
And I've woke up some mornins and sworn off the drink
At that I've done reasonably well I think
But I haven't done well swearin' off you and me
At that I failed miserably
Well I felt the hangover of lovin' all night
I've sat at the bar all alone in a fight
I've bottled up feelin's and poured 'em out too
Being drunk's a lot like lovin' you
And I've woke up some mornins and sworn off the drink
And at that I've done reasonably well I think
But I haven't done well swearin' off you and me
At that I failed miserably
Well I drank 'til I stumbled
I loved 'til I fell
When the drunk part was over love hurt me like hell
And I know about drinkin'
So I know one thing's true
Being drunk's a lot like lovin' you
Though I know what a taste of the wrong love can do
Sometimes I still get drunk lovin' you
