I keep my temperature at 74 when I'm at the crib 
And 79 in the winter time, thats just how I live 
But when the homies call n say lets hit the town, 
when we do them haters frown, 
nigga turn the heat down 
I know we skip the line, 
n bitches think we fine 
I know you feelin drunk n tough, 
but you best recline 
You don't wanna get stained 
Its pain in this lane

With the quick.
