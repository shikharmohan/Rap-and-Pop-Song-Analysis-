If I could I would rewind the times she cried
I just turned around and walked away
Wish there was a switch that I could give
Then she'd love me like she loved my yesterday
What I'd give to hold her in my arms
Feel her heart and wipe her tears right off her face
That's just plain foolishness
The truth is life just doesn't ever work that way
She's gone, oh no, oh no
My baby's gone, oh no, oh no
The mornin' sun stills the stars, she shines her eyes
And mine are laughin' once again
Her long hair flowin', I'm there holdin' her
And hopin' that this feelin' never ends
But it's just a dream inside my head
Gone with the wind just like a child's red balloon
Floatin' up into the sky so high
And disappearin' out into the wild blue
She's gone, oh no, oh no
My baby's gone, oh no, oh no
She's a ghost town train, a tear drop in the rain, oh no
She's two tail lights disappearin' in the night, oh no
Oh no, she is gone
She's a ghost town train, a tear drop in the rain
Oh, my baby's gone
She's two tail lights disappearin' in the night
Oh, now I'm all alone
She's a ghost town train, a tear drop in the rain
Oh, my baby's gone
She's two tail lights disappearin' in the night, oh
  (If I could I would rewind the time)
She's a ghost town train a tear, oh
  (And I'd turn around and walk away)
She's two tail lights disappearin' in the night, oh
