Thugs Get Lonely Too:
Pac:
See it aint easy bein me life as a celebrity is less than heavily I got these fakes and these backstabbers chasin me around and its always drama whenever I wanna get around. 
Mama told me long before I ever came up gotta be true to what you do and keep your game up cause thangs change and jealousy becomes a factor best friends at your wifes house trying to mac. 
Im on tour but still they keep knocking on my door and I got no time to work im steadying wanting more everyday is a test yes I try hard but im struggling with every breath. I pray to god that the that the woman that I left at home all alone aint got nothing like trying to bone over the phone in my mind I could see em naked I cant take it got me shaking at the thought that we can make it. I thought you knew
