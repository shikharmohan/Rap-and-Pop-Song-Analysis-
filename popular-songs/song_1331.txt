Oh say, can you see
By the dawns early light?
What so proudly we hailed
At the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars
Through the perilous flight
O'er the ramparts we watched
Were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets' red glare
The bursting in air
Gave proof thro' the night
That our flag was still there
Oh say, does that
Star spangled banner yet wave?
O'er the land of the free
And the home of the brave
