Her husband left on Saturday
For a woman that was half her age
Sunday she just stayed in bed
With the covers pulled over her head
But on Monday morning she woke up
And loaded up her pick-up truck
Took one last look at her old life
Then hit the gas and said, "Goodbye"
In her faded jeans and her old baseball cap
Oh, she knows for sure, she ain't coming back
This is a house she thought
She'd never spend this day
Sitting behind the wheel on the interstate
40 was quite alright
But she's changing roads tonight
And it's such a bittersweet way to celebrate
She's turning 50 today
She left that Oklahoma town
The only world she had know till now
And memories of those 20 years
She watched them in that rear-view mirror
Fade away, oh, but that's all right
Yeah, this could be the time of her life
This is a house she thought
She'd never spend this day
Sitting behind the wheel
On the interstate
40 was quite alright
But she's changing roads tonight
And it's such a bittersweet way to celebrate
She's turning 50 today
Oh, her windows are down
Then the wind blows her hair
Where she goes could be anywhere
40 was quite alright
But she's changing roads tonight
Tomorrow's a mystery, oh, and she can't wait
She's turning 50, she's turning 50
Oh, she's turning 50 today
