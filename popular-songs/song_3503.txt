I don't know why he does what he does
Playing lost and found with your love
Trying to confuse you, use you
Girl, he gonna lose you, sure enough
Don't know why he says all those things
Always shooting down all your dreams
He oughta know better than that
He oughta be watchin' his back
'Cause you know, you know
Girl I'd love to shine in your eyes
If only just for a moment girl, I'd be satisfied
If I could only touch your cheek
Maybe that's all I'd need
To make my life complete
'Cause girl, I can make you smile
If you knew that I was here
Wishing I could just be your tear
I don't know why he can't find the words
Saying all those things you deserve
Girl, if it was me there, I swear
You know you wouldn't have to feel so unsure
About what tomorrow might bring
Girl, you know I'd give everything
If I could just hold you like him
If I could be more than just friends
'Cause you know, you know
Girl I'd love to shine in your eyes
If only just for a moment girl, I'd be satisfied
If I could only touch your cheek
Maybe that's all I'd need
To make my life complete
'Cause girl, I can make you smile
If you knew that I was here
Wishing I could just be your tear
Girl, I'd love to shine in your eyes
If only just for a moment girl, I'd be satisfied
If I could only touch your cheek
Maybe that's all I'd need
To make my life complete
'Cause girl, I can make you smile
If you knew that I was here
Wishing I could just be your tear
Your tear, your tear, just be your tear
Wishing I could just be your tear
Your tear, your tear, yeah
Oh girl, I'd love to shine in your eyes
And your kiss and your smile and your touch
Girl, I'd love that look in your eyes
When you'd say that you'd need me so much
If only I could just be your tear, yeah, yeah
