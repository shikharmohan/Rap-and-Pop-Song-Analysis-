Lay back, enjoy the fall, lover, I won't hurt you
I take it all on if you trust me, don't hesitate
Let it go, let me know, baby, show me
I don't read minds but I'm trying my best to read yours
Yeah, let me know, let me know
Yeah, let me know, it's all for you
Help me, help yourself
I want to give it all to you but
Don't make me second guess
I don't want to play games no more
For sure I've got your back
I've never wanted anything
More than you and your sexy smile
I love you so try not to blow it this time
Yeah, let me know, let me know
Yeah, let me know, it's all for you
Everything inside you, about you
I wanna know, taste, hold, love you, anytime I want to
Let me show you, let me give you
Everything I have saved just for you
I know you love me but I'm gonna need more
Than what you're giving me
I wanna feel you but I feel empty
You gotta help me, you gotta meet me halfway
There I see you, can you see me? Closer now
Just tell me, show me, what it's gonna take to get you to trust me
Love me like I know you can
Yeah, let me know, let me know
Yeah, let me know, it's all for you
