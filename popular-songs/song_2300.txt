I Get the girls thatÃÂ¢€s pretty in face
Real nice booty, still skinny in the waste
I like the way she move when she shake it in my face 
(ItÃÂ¢€s a code red when we move up in the place)
Steady coming in and they all got friends
CouldnÃÂ¢€t be the alcohol, itÃÂ¢€s the beauty to blame
Pop this bottle passing out rose
(ItÃÂ¢€s to many girls, VIP is going crazy)
Like race cars, we stopping them
Like Cop cars (Code Red x3)
ItÃÂ¢€s a code red.
Steeze so fresh, lil mamaÃÂ¢€s like wow
Baby imma king, imma hand you dis crown
Number one lady, baddest chick in the city
They all look witty, its about to get silly
Trapped in the corner, baby putting on me
IÃÂ¢€m coppin hella feelz I can tell that she want me
SheÃÂ¢€s a very freaky girl,donÃÂ¢€t bring her to momma,
First you get the name, and then you get the numba
