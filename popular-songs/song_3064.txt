I'll decide
The path of my life
I'll choose
What I wanna do
You can stand
In the way
But the wall you made
Will come crumblin'
So I will say today
[Chorus:]
Don't tell me
I'm wrong or right
Don't try to
Stir up a fight
Don't get in my way
When I wanna choose
Don't wanna hear
What you've got to say
Just don't
I'm gonna run
Far away
Leave your place
Today
You may try to 
Hold me back
But what can I say
It's my life
Stay out of it
[Chorus]
Come on
Don't try to keep me
From life
I'm growing older
I'm getting stronger
Ready to fly away
Hey hey
[Chorus]
Just don't
