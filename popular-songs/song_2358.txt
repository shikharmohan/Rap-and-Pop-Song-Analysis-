[Laughs] Yo! This song is about this girl name Lisa.
It's very interesting.
[Verse 1:]
(Why babe) Why babe, you puttin' it all on me.
You didn't wanna do what I told you to do.
You weren't listenin' (listening)
So you dragged it out, wouldn't give friendship a try.
I don't know why you wanna give yoself these butterflies.
You wanna scrunch yo' face, you wanna stomp yo feet (Whooa)
You gonna be real anger, but you shouldn't be wit me (Whooa)
Feelins' that's in this girl, nobody has no say
Girl you just gotta trust me, that I aint gonna turn this way. (Yaay)
[Chorus:]
I guess I gotta leave her alone now
I never meant have her pretty eyes cry
I guess I gotta let her go now (I gotta let you go)
Then she'll never fully understand bye bye
[Verse 2:]
Now you're standing tough, obnoxiusly
You can try to front if you want but I know what's underneath
It's killin' you, like it's killin' me (bang, bang)
I gotta stomach ache and a heart break baby like you wouldn't believe
I try to do us right (it was too sexual, too sexual) (Whooa)
But you made too hard to fight (but it was too sexual, too sexual) (Whooa)
I tried to stay away (it was too sexual, too sexual) (Whooa)
But you knew just how to play (cos it was too sexual, too sexual)
[Chorus:]
I guess I gotta leave her alone now (leave her alone)
Never meant to have her pretty eyes cry
I guess I gotta let her go now (got to let her go)
Then she'll never fully understand bye bye
[Bridge:]
This I'ma say, girl if you believe
That I just I want to hurt you and I just want to see (Whooa)
You cry on my shoulder, and tears on my sleeve (Yeah)
I don't need this motherfucka nor, in pain (Whooa)
(Ha, no I don't) I don't need this mothafucka nor, in pain (Whooa)
I don't need this mothafucka nor, in pain (Whooa)
Rumors' and bullshit, rumors bullshit
Rumors' and bullshit, rumors bullshit (Whooa)
(I cannot fuckin' stand this) Rumors' bullshit, rumors bullshit (Whooa)
(All this bullshit) Rumors' bullshit, rumors bullshit (Whooa)
[Chorus: x2]
I guess I gotta leave her alone now (leave her alone)
(Baby I gotta let it go) I never mean't to have her pretty eyes cry
I guess I gotta let her go now (Oh no) (Let her go)
Then she'll fully understand bye bye (You never believe)
[Bridge:]
This I'ma say, girl if you believe
That I just I want to hurt you and I just want to see (Whooa)
You cry on my shoulder, and tears on my sleeve (Yeah)
I don't need this motherfucka nor, in pain (Whooa)
(Ha, no I don't) I don't need this mothafucka nor, in pain (Whooa)
I don't need this mothafucka nor, in pain (Whooa)
Rumors' and bullshit, rumors bullshit
Rumors' and bullshit, rumors bullshit (Whooa)
(I cannot fuckin' stand this) Rumors' and bullshit, rumors bullshit (Whooa)
(All this bullshit) Rumors' and bullshit, rumors bullshit (Whooa)
That's fucked up right (Whoaa)
(Humming) I tired of mothafuckas
Rumors' and bullshit, BULLSHIT!
