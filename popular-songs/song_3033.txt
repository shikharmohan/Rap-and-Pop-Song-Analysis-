{On Christmas Eve in 1818
A blizzard stranded the tiny village of Ogledorf
Nestled in the Austrian mountains
That same day the people of St. Nicholas' church
Found their organ broken}
{So the priest and organist
Began composing a song
That could be sung without an organ
Yet beautiful enough to express their Christmas joy}
{All day and all night long they worked
And at midnight, the gentle carol 'Silent Night' was born
The pure clear tones echoed through the hills
And the world has been captured by the beauty
Of that simple song ever since}
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin, mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night, holy night
Shepherds pray at the sight
Glory streams from heaven afar
Heavenly [unverified] sing hallelujah
Christ the Savior is born
Christ the Savior is born
Silent night, holy night
All is calm and all is bright
Round yon virgin, mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night, holy night
Sleep in heavenly peace
