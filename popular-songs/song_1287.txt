You've got your mother and your brother
Every other undercover telling you what to say
You think I'm stupid but the truth is that it's Cupid
Baby, loving you has made me this way
So before you point your finger
Get your hand off of my trigger, oh yeah
You need to know the situation's getting old
And now the more you talk, the less I can take, oh
I'm looking for attention not another question
Should you stay or should you go?
Well if you don't have the answer, why you still standing here?
Hey hey hey hey, just walk away
Just walk away, just walk away
I waited here for you like a kid waiting after school
So tell me, how come you never showed?
I gave you everything and never asked for anything
And look at me, I'm all alone
So before you start defending baby
Stop all your pretending
I know you know I know, so what's the point in being slow?
Let's get this show on the road today, hey
I'm looking for attention not another question
Should you stay or should you go?
Well if you don't have the answer, why you still standing here?
Hey hey hey hey, just walk away
Just walk away, just walk away
I want a love, I want a fire to feel the burn, my desires
I want a man by my side, not a boy who runs and hides
Are you gonna fight for me, die for me, live and breathe for me?
Do you care for me? 'Cause if you don't then just leave!
I'm looking for attention not another question
Should you stay or should you go?
Well if you don't have the answer, why you still standing here?
Hey hey hey hey, just walk away
If you don't have the answer
Walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away
