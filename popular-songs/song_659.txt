Huu
Baby come and talk to me
Together we can work this out
We gotta love thing
We're talkin' about
The way you looked at me
Tell me you're sorry
You walked by me
Whisperin' you love me
When I tried to hold you tight
You pulled away
But you wanted me to stay
Instead you ran away
Baby, talk to me, let's stop playin' games
Don't turn away from me
Just look me straight in the eyes
Don't try to sweet talk me
With those nasty words you say
Baby, just be real
And tell me how you feel, baby
Ooh baby, come and talk to me
  (Talk)
  (Together)
Together we can work this out
We gotta love thing
We're talkin' about
The way you tricked me
You know that wasn't right, ooh
You tried to fix it
But all they did was fight
Because I gave you everything
I had to give
If you know it's worth the fight
We gotta compromise
Baby, talk to me
And tell me what's wrong?
Come sit down next to me
And let me feel the vibe you on
You can lay your head on me
And everything will be alright
But we must communicate
Tomorrow it could be too late
Ooh baby, come and talk to me
  (Talk)
Together we can work this out
(Talk to me baby)
We gotta love thing
We're talkin' about
'Cause I love you, boy
And I need you here
Together we can make this thing work out
  (We can make this thing work out)
To think about what we could miss
It makes me want to lose my mind
Talk to me
Come on, come on, come on
Talk to me
Woha
Woha
Haa, haa
Come on
Makes me want to change baby
Ooh, baby, come and talk to me

Together we can work this out
We gotta love thing

Talk to me baby
