(Come with me tonight)
Let's blow out these city lights
Let's just leave it all behind
Get up where the air is still
You can hear the whippoorwill
Start a fire, pass the shine
Won't be home 'til mornin' time
Shout your name out in the wind
Confess my love for you again
Give you all I got to give
That's how we live up on the ridge
Won't you come with me tonight
Where moonlight drifts into your eyes?
I just want one little kiss
When we get high up on the ridge
Hey now, honey child
We'd be runnin' free and wild
No one care what you do
Ain't no law to answer to
Dance around in the dirt
Listen to them crickets chirp
Hear old Jake start to howl
When he hears that ol' hoot owl
Give you all I got to give
That's how we live up on the ridge
Won't you come with me tonight
Where moonlight drifts into your eyes
I just want one little kiss
When we get high up on the ridge
Come on girl, it's almost dawn
Let's get it 'fore the magic's gone
Tall, tall grass all around
Come on, lay that blanket down
Wild flowers just like you
Lay on me like mornin' dew
Now take my hand, walk with me
Sun come up through them trees
Give you all I got to give
That's how we live up on the ridge
Won't you come with me tonight
Where moonlight drifts into your eyes?
I just want one little kiss
When we get high up on the ridge
I just want one little kiss
When we get high up on the ridge
