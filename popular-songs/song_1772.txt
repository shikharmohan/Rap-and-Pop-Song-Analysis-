I feel like I'm a millions miles away
From myself more and more these days
I've been down too many open roads
But they never lead me home
And now I just don't know who I really am, how it's gonna be
Is it something that I can't see?
I wanna understand
Maybe I will never be who I was before
Maybe I don't even know her anymore
Or maybe who I am today ain't so far from yesterday
Can I find a way to be every part of me?
So I'll try, try to slow things down
And find myself, get my feet back on the ground
It'll take time but I know I'll be alright
'Cause nothin' much has changed on the inside
It's hard to figure out how it's gonna be?
'Cause I don't really know now
I wanna understand
Maybe I will never be who I was before
Maybe I don't even know her anymore
Or maybe who I am today ain't so far from yesterday
Can I find a way to be every part of me?
I don't wanna wait too long
To find out where I'm meant to belong
I always wanted to be where I am today
But I never thought I'd feel this way
Maybe I will never be who I was before
Maybe I don't even know her anymore
Or maybe who I am today ain't so far from yesterday
Can I find a way to be every part of me?
Every part of me
