I was fifteen when my daddy died
Mama worked two jobs just to get by
Seemed like a blessin' when Harley came around
So she took his name but I had my doubts
Didn't take long for his drinkin' ways
To start showin' up on mama's face
One violent night hidin' under my bed
Swore that he wouldn't see another sunset
Next day I followed him down to the river bank
I knew one of us wouldn't walk away
I might of had a plan but he didn't know it
Might have been scared but I didn't show it
That's all between the river and me
With the current and the rocks coulda been risky
Might of been sober but I brought the whiskey
That's all between the river and me
I walked up to him and I said his name
Just so he could see the look on my face
We stood eye to eye and toe to toe
When I told him that he wasn't gonna come back home
He raised his fist to me but I didn't flinch
I said, "I ain't your son, you son of a bitch"
I might of had a knife in my back pocket
Might of pulled it out before he saw it
That's all between the river and me
I might of had a gun but I didn't fire it
He might of tried to yell but I kept him quiet
That's all between the river and me
That's all between the river and me
Sheriff came knockin' on our front door
Said they found his body by the reservoir
"Bottle in his shirt and liquor in his blood
Must of fallen in the river and he never came up"
Might of been blood but they never saw it
Just a little mud on the living room carpet
That's all between the river and me
But after what he done, oh, there ain't no wonder
Can't remember how long I held him under
That's all between the river and me
That's all between the river and me
Yeah that's all between the river and me
That's all that's all
