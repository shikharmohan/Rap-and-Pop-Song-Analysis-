(Dierks Bentley)
I know things haven't gone like you planned
And for that I'm partly to blame
You didn't want to fall in love not yet
Cause you've still got so many dreams to chase
And love is a double edged sword
It lets you walk though life feeling content
But that's a feeling you say you can't afford
And you'd be better off bein lonely again
Chorus
But please don't leave me
Leave me in love
Before you walk away break my heart
Let me give you up
If you need your freedom
To find yourself
Release me from these chains of love
Lord knows I need your help
But please don't leave me
Don't leave me in love
You ask if you can hold me one last time
Sweetheart, you know I can't resist
You say tonight we'll fall asleep as lovers
But tomorrow we'll wake up as friends
Chorus
Bridge
How can I ever love somebody new
If I can't get my heart back from you
So please don't leave me
Don't leave me, don't leave me
Don't leave me in love
Don't leave me in love
Don't leave me
