[1st verse]
And God said
Let us make man in our image
According to our likeness
Let them have dominion over the fish
Of the sea
Over the birds of the air
Over the cattle
And over all the earth
Projected image
Across my soul
Saying
Can't die
Many
Death situations
But that ain't
Why
I got the
Spirit of an angel
Mixed with demoniac
Ways of living
So this means
I'll beat the evil
Out of a non-believer
Until praise is given
But I know
Torture is evil
Though it says in the
Bible
You got to be
Righteous spirited
For the
Arrival
I'm righteous and wicked
But I wonder
Can I go
If there's a heaven
But on earth it's
Survival
Connected with angels
But to demons
I'm vital
Approaching with hate
Oh yes it's
Homicidal
Like denouncing selena at
Cinco de mayo
Certain death
Oh no
Oh no
I'm on the
Road to heaven and
Hell
Don't even bother me
Ever since eleven and
Twelve
I've been that prodigy
Though life has never been
Swell
Somewhere there's gotta be
Where a good samaritan
Prevails but
They get straight sodomy
So I learned the ways of
Man
Grands
Filling my pants
Gun in my hand
For the demons
On the land
On the other hand
I really am
Angelic
I ain't got to stress it
You can tell it
Look into my eyes
No surprise
I'm half cupid
Half relic
He who
Treads the path of the beast
Is also he who's sins are repentable
But if you ever
Ever ever ever
Hurt a god
Then we got to do away with the genitals
Don't ever do something you'll regret
Do away with all these goody goody
Law abiding mutha fuckas
And let there be tech
Nigga
[bridge]
If anybody say
Fuck me
Everybody say
Fuck you
Cause they know my shit's
Pure
Soul serving
And
Plus true
If anybody say
Fuck me
Everybody say
Fuck you
Odd one tech
Got that God complex
[hook]
Get on your
Knees and pray
If you step in our way
Cause we spray till they decay
The ones who hate everyday
But how long
Must we flash and pop
How long
Must we show demons
We can't be stopped
Get on your
Knees and pray
If you step in our way
Cause we spray till they decay
The ones who hate everyday
But how long
Must we flash and pop
How long
Must we show demons
We can't be stopped
[2nd verse]
Can they fuck with you
No
Their brain frames are too
Slow
The villain will kill 'em
With new
Flow
If you're hating me
This is for you
Blow
I've been to humble
With y'all niggas
Time to rumble
With y'all niggas
Me and don juan forever
We getting figures
Me and the rogue dogs we kicking
It getting richer
All these fools
Thinking they gonna stop me
I'm about to make us a million
Just watch me
Everybody thinking they heated
But they sloppy
Nigga that's why
You never be selling copies
I will
Rise above all of you
Regardless
Of my skrill
That ain't got shit to do
With techa the
N9ne's skill
Bust on you rapper cats
And proceed to make
Mill
Five six vill
I be seeing 'em
Down at mardi gras
Getting flows off
Everything getting
Showed off
Not me
Try to mock me
On a record heads
Getting blowed off
Freestyle I admire
But every week
You're giving away fire
Your rappers license expired
Leaving nothing to be desired
Oh God bless
This pacticular rapper in kc
No matter how hard you try
You can't fuck with me
First
Learn how to do choruses
Then try to get people to trust you
Everybody wanna be the special
If anybody say
Fuck me
Everybody say
Fuck you
[hook]
Get on your
Knees and pray
If you step in our way
Cause we spray till they decay
Everything you built
The ones who hate everyday
But how long
Must we flash and pop
How long
Must we show demons
We can't be stopped
Get on your
Knees and pray
If you step in our way
Cause we spray till they decay
[bridge]
The ones who hate everyday
But how long
Must we flash and pop
How long
Must we show demons
We can't be stopped
[3rd verse]
If I offended you in anyway
Maybe the shoe fits
Either that
Or you're just plenty gay
If you're like me
You don't give a damn
You're just enjoying the flow
To all the people
Who were offended
I'm about to offend you
Some more
Is god
White
Brown, green, red
Or even blue
Is he american
Arabic, mexican
Or even jew
And wanna be the chosen few
Everybody wanna be
But they're gonna be
Through
Till
You do right by me
Everything that you do
Is gonna be whack
Is 'bout to crack
Everything you did to me
Is coming back
Nowhere to scat
And I say that
Cause I know jesus christ
And God is black
And they coming back nigga
If anybody say
Fuck me
Everybody say
Fuck you
Cause they know my shit's
Pure
Soul serving
And
Plus true
If anybody say
Fuck me
Everybody say
Fuck you
Odd one tech

Get on your
Knees and pray
If you step in our way
Cause we spray till they decay
The ones who hate everyday
But how long
Must we flash and pop
How long

We can't be stopped
Get on your
Knees and pray
If you step in our way
Cause we spray till they decay
The ones who hate everyday
