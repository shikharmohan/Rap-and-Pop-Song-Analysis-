Automatic, supersonic, hypnotic, funky fresh
Work my body, so melodic this beat flows right through my chest
Everybody, ma and papi came to party, grab somebody
Work your body, work your body, let me see you 1, 2 step
(Here we go)
Rock it, don't stop it
Everybody get on the floor
Crank the party up
We about to get it on
Let me see ya, 1, 2 step
I love it when ya, 1, 2 step
Everybody, 1, 2 step
We about to get it on
(This beat is)
Outrageous, so contagious, make you crave it
(Jazze made it)
So retarded, top-charted, ever since the day I started
Strut my stuff and yes I flaunt it, goodies make the boys jump on it
No, I can't control myself, now let me do my 1, 2 step
(Come on)
Rock it, don't stop it
Everybody get on the floor
Crank the party up
We about to get it on
Let me see ya, 1, 2 step
I love it when ya, 1, 2 step
Everybody, 1, 2 step

We gon' drop the beat like this, ooh wee
It don't matter to me, we can dance slow
  (Ladies and Gentlemen)
Which ever way the beat drop, our bodies will go
  (I like this)
So swing it over here, Mr. DJ
  (Hey, hey)
And we will, we will rock you
(Oh yeah)
It don't matter to me, we can dance slow

Which ever way the beat drop, our bodies will go
(Yeah, yeah)
So swing over here, Mr. DJ
(Ladies and Gentlemen)
And we will, we will rock you
(Wee)
I shake it like jello, make the boys say hello
'Cause they know I'm rockin' the beat
I know you heard about a lot of great MC's
But they ain't got nothing on me
Because I'm 5 foot 2, I wanna dance with you
And I'm sophisticated fun
I eat fillet mignon and I'm nice and young
Best believe I'm number one
(Ooh)
Rock it, don't stop it
Everybody get on the floor
Crank the party up
(Ooh)
We about to get it on
(Come on)

Everybody, 1, 2 step
We about to get it on
Rock it, don't stop it
Everybody get on the floor
Crank the party up
We about to get it on
Let me see ya, 1, 2 step
I love it when ya, 1, 2 step
Everybody, 1, 2 step
We about to get it on
