So it's over, he's with someone else and you know her
And you just can get any lower
You sit in the dark alone
And won't answer your phone
Well I'm sorry, I wanna attend your pity party
I rather go have calamari
And maybe a drink and yes I think
You should come with me
Life is long, there will be pain but life goes on
With everyday a brand new song
But if you rather stay at home
Let me do you a favor
I'll ask the sun to shine away from you today so you can cry
If that's what you want, alright
I'll ask the clouds to bring the rain for you today so you can cry
If that's what you want, alright
If that's what you want, alright
Said I'm a lover and the pain of a heart from another
Can be difficult to recover, yes this I know
But difficult isn't impossible
And you shiver, he was your warmth, you cry, lips quiver
Well, honey go on cry me a river
You wanna be down
Fine, let me help you out, how 'bout
I'll ask the sun to shine away from you today so you can cry
If that's what you want, alright
I'll ask the clouds to bring the rain for you today so you can cry
If that's what you want, alright
If that's what you want, alright
Said if that's what you want, alright
And your tears won't bring him back
I know you wish that it did
But it just don't work like that
I know that healing takes time
Hey, even your heart has a pace
But how much time are you gonna take?
Too much would be a mistake
I'll ask the sun to shine away from you today so you can cry
If that's what you want, alright
I'll ask the clouds to bring the rain for you today so you can cry
If that's what you want, alright
I'll ask the sun to shine away from you today so you can cry
If that's what you want
