You know it seems like I've loved you forever
Who could be closer than you and I
People even say, we're so much alike
But they don't know why
I've been loving you so long
That I know every move you make, every breath you take
What I feel is so strong, sometimes I don't know where I end
Where you begin
And you make me so happy feeling like this
There's so much ahead that I don't want to miss
Oh, I want to keep it so good, so, so, so long
So good, so real, so right
Oh, I want to keep it so good, so, so, so long
Oh, darling, don't think for a minute
Time could ever steal the thrill away
You've still got the power to be my man
And you know you can
I've been loving you so long
That I know every move you make, every breath you take
What I feel is so strong, sometimes I don't know where I end
Where you begin
And you make me so happy feeling like this
There's so much ahead that I don't want to miss
Oh, I want to keep it so good, so, so, so long
Oh, I want to keep it so good, so, so, so long
So long, so good, so fine, so real, so right
So long, so fine, so long
So good, so fine, so long
So, so, so long
