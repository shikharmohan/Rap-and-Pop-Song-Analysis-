The Industry's a bunch of fuckin' punk
FUCK YOU, FUCK YOU
FUCK YOU, FUCK YOU
He won't play me on radio 'cuz they be on
Punk shit daily on, industry's a shady one
He won't play me on radio 'cuz they be on
Punk shit daily on, industry's a shady one
He won't play me on radio 'cuz they be on
Punk shit daily on, industry's a shady one
He won't play me on radio 'cuz they be on
Punk shit daily on, industry's a shady one
Don't nobody wanna deal with a nigga that got it together
For real and even think his own thoughts?
Everybody wanna do what everybody else doin' the copy cat is what
They been taught, I'm ma get in the brain of the lame
I contain pain and I'm ma give it to the rap game
The way you're doin' it the way you're persuin' it you're
Gonna ruin' it villain it's a god damn shame
Are you ready for the real here we go now?
Most on the radio can't flow now
Everyday I gotta cut the radio down
Sound like another Pac or an O Town
You can't have a contest or a show down
When two cats got the same kind of flow sound
Tecca Nina I'm comin' to put the mo down
Run up in the record label with a four pound
Am I too versatile cursed to drown in the bowels
Of the earth man I'll be first to growl and burst out the vowels
Of the original murderist verse out the mouth
Big Tech N9ne's gonna be the one runnin' the race
That's real I'm speakin' to everyone in the place
I can deal with you don't like the drum
And the bass if you can deal with a mother fuckin' gun in your face
I can't get with it, record labels and the industry is sick with it
P.D.'s some really don't know a hit for shit
Kick the bitch if you diss my hit, you might get pistol whipped
Catch'em in the hall, hitt'em in the jaw
Give it to the fans they can get it all
'Cuz the industry is punks, Tech I'm ready to get krunk
I'm comin' to straight dump with a pump
He won't play me on radio 'cuz they be on
Punk shit daily on, industry's a shady one
He won't play me on radio 'cuz they be on
Punk shit daily on, industry's a shady one
He won't play me on radio 'cuz they be on
Punk shit daily on, industry's a shady one
He won't play me on radio 'cuz they be on
Punk shit daily on, industry's a shady one
How many 2 Pacs and JZ's and Master P's can they conceive?
Don't they know a few gloc's 380's and master keys will make'em bleed
How you gonna say black people won't listen
To this or don't listen to that?
Like sayin' a fool can slang cane a fool can gang bang
But never will get hit with a gat
You better get your story straight 'cuz I ain't no devil for real
I'm a rebel for real that Tech N9ne is on some other level for real
You're a pebble to real niggas songs like Psycho Bitch and Real Killer
Einstein nigga that's a mill stealer the idiots say black folk won't feel us
What you think we dumb? Do we all gotta run when the heat come?
Showin' original tongue it'll be fun but the mother fuckers want the bums
And the weak ones Suge Knight punked
The industry quick that's because most the industry's bitch
Nigga, I'm a man I don't be runnin' from nobody we deal with niggas
Who trippin' and givin' us shit
Radio won't play the unk fay thought they wanted rap
To advance but they ont day when I die I'm ma aunt hay
Every industry fagot who givin' money to an unk pay
Tech and Tekneko get people involved from KC to Mexico
Strapped with that fat desert eagle run up on the industry
And let the heat go
He won't play me on radio 'cuz they be on
Punk shit daily on, industry's a shady one
He won't play me on radio 'cuz they be on
Punk shit daily on, industry's a shady one
He won't play me on radio 'cuz they be on
Punk shit daily on, industry's a shady one
He won't play me on radio 'cuz they be on
Punk shit daily on, industry's a shady one
You can look into my EYE's and you can see why these
Mother fuckers don't wanna see my steeze
'Cuz I'm ma killa when lyricals come undone I do miracles
And I come from the kingdom of rumble drums
And hums become bumbles, I'm the one that begun
The gun tongue get sprung, got everyone comin' in bundles
Act like a bitch treated like a bitch
Act like a chump, treated like a chump
When the funk jumps what you gonna want?
Ain't gon' want nothin' industry punks
You can run but ya can't hide from the ride
You can say that it's dope but I won't buy it
You can think Tech 9 really won't fly
But I got a killer ear and a killer eye
Def Jam take chances in my opinion
They give advances to the niggas that's really on
Universal loud la face, that's some of my favorites
But the ones who call the shots most of 'em on some hater shit
That other shit, for ya mother sis or your brother bitch
Not no lover lick, packin' blackened fat and blubber shit
Yeah, the radio dead 'cuz the industry is punks put the
Double barrel to its foe head
He won't play me on radio 'cuz they be on
Punk shit daily on, industry's a shady one
He won't play me on radio 'cuz they be on
Punk shit daily on, industry's a shady one
He won't play me on radio 'cuz they be on
Punk shit daily on, industry's a shady one
He won't play me on radio 'cuz they be on
Punk shit daily on, industry's a shady one
He won't play me on radio 'cuz they be on
Punk shit daily on, industry's a shady one
He won't play me on radio 'cuz they be on
Punk shit daily on, industry's a shady one
He won't play me on radio 'cuz they be on
Punk shit daily on, industry's a shady one
He won't play me on radio 'cuz they be on
Punk shit daily on, industry's a shady one
Now that's absolute power, bitch
That's real shit
We ain't kissin' some
Motherfucker's ass to be accepted
Open your mind motherfuckers
Here's the new shit
You know what I'm sayin' TechN9NE
