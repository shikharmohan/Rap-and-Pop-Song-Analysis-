Mama moved out
Daddy sold the house
They split up the money
And went on their way
And all the kings horses
And all the kings men
Couldn't put mama and daddy
Back together again
Starting over again
Where should they begin
'Cause they never been out on their own
Starting over again
Where do you begin
When your dreams are all shattered
And the kids are all grown and the whole world cries
He got an apartment
She moved in with her sisters
He's schemin' big deals
With one of his friends
While she sits at home
Sortin' out pieces
Of left over memories
From thirty odd years
Starting over again
Where do you begin
When you've never been out on your own
Starting over again
Never any end
What will the neighbors say
They're talking talk, it's small town news
They're facing fifty years old wrecking up a happy home
And this far down the road, you find yourself alone, two fools
Starting over again
Oh, where do you begin
When you've never been out on your own
Starting over again
Oh, never any end
When your dreams are all shattered
And the kids are all grown
And all the kings horses
And all the kings men
Couldn't put mama and daddy
Back together
