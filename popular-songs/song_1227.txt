Tired of everything around me
I smile I don't feel a thing, no
I'm so far from where I need to be
I've given up on faith, on everything
All I want, all I need is some peace
There's a hole inside of me
It's so cold, slowly killing me, yeah
Secrets, secret
Eating at the core of me
  (Eating at the core of me)
You shut off, you shut off
Trusting all the lies I breathe
I'm so far from where I need to be
I've given up on faith, on everything
All I wanted, all I needed was some peace, yeah
There's a hole inside of me
It's so damn cold, slowly killing me, yeah
Sinking ever so slowly
So far from where I should be
No hands reaching out for me
Help me, help me
Something's gone, I can feel it
It's all wrong, I'm so sick of this, yeah
There's a hole inside of me
It's so cold, slowly killing me, yeah
There's a hole
  (Sinking ever so slowly)
Inside of me
  (So far from where I should be)
It's so damn cold
  (No hands reaching out for me)
Slowly killing me, yeah
  (Help me, help me)
