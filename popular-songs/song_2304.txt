There's just somethin' I wanna do to you
I been watchin' you all night long
I been watchin' you all night long
Beg for it, don't panic
When you see it, you betta hold on
You said you need it, well dammit come on
I'ma lay right here while they play my song
And watch you beg for it, take that off
When you go in there, you betta get it all
Don't play wit it, baby, go 'head get it all
I'ma beg for you, baby, as soon as you get all
Ain't neva had body make your hood friends
Ask you how long does he give it
Baby, get ready to know
They ain't ready for the play
I'm a game when it's up, I'll make you
Beg for it, don't panic
When you see it, you betta hold on
You said you need it, well dammit come on
I'ma lay right here while they play my song
And watch you beg for it, take that off
When you go in there, you betta get it all
Don't play wit it, baby, go 'head get it all
I'ma beg for you, baby, as soon as you get all
Ain't no me lovin' you, ain't no you lovin' me
This is strictly because when we came in free
Know we were chosen for
Understand what's the dress code
Don't be mad if I ain't playin' for keys
Damn, I'ma do all those things in my dream
On my hood in the cold while it's raining on us
When I get it I know you gon' let all ya girls know
There gon' be no second guessin' 'bout me
Beg for it, don't panic
When you see it, you betta hold on
You said you need it, well dammit come on
I'ma lay right here while they play my song
And watch you beg for it, take that off
When you go in there, you betta get it all
Don't play wit it, baby, go 'head get it all
I'ma beg for you, baby, as soon as you get all
Can I get a hit on the dance floor?
  (You can get it)
Can I get a hit on the dance floor?
  (Tell me, can you feel it?)
Can I get a hit on the dance floor, can I get it?
Can I get a hit on the dance floor, can I get it?
Can I get a hit on the dance floor, can I get it?
Can I get a hit on the dance floor, can I get it?
Beg for it, don't panic
When you see it, you betta hold on
You said you need it, well dammit come on
I'ma lay right here while they play my song
And watch you beg for it, take that off
When you go in there, you betta get it all
Don't play wit it, baby, go 'head get it all
I'ma beg for you, baby, as soon as you get all
You see, I been watchin' you, I'm sorry
