Tech N9ne - Intro
Another piece that I wrote, about me, being stuck in my ways.
Yeah.....
Chrous -
And I can't give up what I'm in love with.
I guess I'm a mess, and I just can't shake it.
I just can't change what I am.
What did I do to be so wrong?
Could it be so diffrent?
Is there a remedy where you be forgiven me?
