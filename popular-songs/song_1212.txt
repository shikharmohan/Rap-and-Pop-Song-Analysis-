I'm strong but I break
I'm stubborn and I make plenty of mistakes
Yeah, I'm hard and life with me is never easy
To figure out, to love I'm jaded but, oh, so lovely
All you have to do is hold me
And you'll know when you'll see
Just how sweet it can be
If you'll trust me, love me, let me, maybe, maybe
Someday when we're at the same place
When we're on the same road
When it's okay to hold my hand
Without feeling lost, without all the excuses
When it's just because you love me, you let me
You need me then maybe, maybe
All you have to do is hold me
And you'll know when you'll see
Just how sweet it can be
If you'll trust me, love me, let me, maybe, maybe
I'm confusing as hell, I'm north and south
And I'll probably never have it all figured out
But what I know is I wasn't meant to walk this world
Without you and I promise I'll try
Yeah, I'm gonna try to give you every little part of me
Every single detail you missed with your eyes
Then maybe, maybe, yeah, maybe
Yeah, maybe, maybe, yeah, maybe, maybe
One day we'll meet again and you'll need me
You'll see me completely every little bit
Oh yeah, maybe you'll love me, you'll love me then
I don't wanna be tough
And I don't want to be proud
I don't need to be fixed
And I certainly don't need to be found, I'm not lost
I need to be loved, I just need to be loved
I just want to be loved by you
And I won't stop 'cause I believe
That maybe, yeah maybe, maybe, yeah maybe
Maybe, maybe
I should know better than to touch the fire twice
But I'm thinking maybe, yeah, maybe you might
Maybe, love, maybe
