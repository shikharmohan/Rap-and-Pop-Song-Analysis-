She can hear his car as it pulls in the drive
She can whisper a prayer, "Thank God, he's alive"
She can meet him at the door and catch him when he falls
She can even believe that it isn't his fault
But she can't save him
She can make his coffee in the cold light of day
She can make his excuses, tell the boss he'll be late
She can wave at the neighbors, kiss him goodbye
And not say a word 'bout what happened last night
But she can't save him
Sometimes she dreams that he's caught in a stream
And the water keeps pulling him down
She reaches for him as he pulls her in
She wakes just before she drowns
But she can remember the man that he was
And still shed a tear for what he's become
She can live in that house until the day
She sees that it's only herself she can save
'Cause she can't save him
And that day she'll know she hasn't failed
'Cause nothing can change until he saves himself
'Cause she can't save him
No, she can't save him
No, she can't save him
