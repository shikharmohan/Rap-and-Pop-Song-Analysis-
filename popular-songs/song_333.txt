Bad angel, get off of my shoulder
Bad angel, let me be
I'm standing at the cross roads
of Temptation and Salvation Street
I woke up bound and determined
That I would not light it up today
But one drag would stop my shakin'
Right now I could go either way
Bad angel, get off of my shoulder now
Bad angel, let me be
I'm standing at the cross roads
of Temptation and Salvation Street
[Miranda Lambert]
Well the cap is on the bottle
and the bottle is on the shelf
Should I take it or leave it?
Honey, how am I gonna help myself?
Bad angel, get off of my shoulder (get on off of my shoulder)
Bad angel, let me be (oh let me be)
I'm standing at the cross roads
of Temptation and Salvation Street
[Jamey Johnson]
Well I know I should not gamble
'Cause I can't afford to lose
She'd hang me from the rafters
Put the laces in my old working shoes
Bad angel, get off of my should
Bad angel, let me be
I'm standing at the cross roads
of Temptation and Salvation Street
Yes I'm standing at the cross roads
of Temptation and Salvation
Temptation and Salvation
