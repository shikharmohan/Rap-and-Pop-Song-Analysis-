Oh yes
[nas]
Uh, this for you girl
Yo, I took you from the projects, put the best clothes in ya closet
Like ginger from "casino" and now you a pro
We was like joe dimaggio and marilyn monroe
All ya jealous girlfriends hatin' waitin'
So I put the cars in yo hand
All I know is nas was yo man
It was so real, boats and sixes
Special japanese chefs makin' home cooked dishes
Plenty trips, invisible sets
You know what you missin'
[jennifer lopez]
It's funny coz for a while
I walked around with a smile
But... deep inside, I could hear
Voices telling me "this ain't right"
Don't you know, it's not for you
I always knew what I had to do
But it's hard to get away
Cause I love you I just got to say
I used to say I didn't do it but I did it (yes I did)
Telling everybody that I wasn't with it (oh yeah)
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And I know inside that I'm gonna be alright (gonna be alright)
I said I didn't do it but I did it (yes I did)
Telling everybody that I wasn't with it (oh yeah)
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright (gonna be alright)
[jennifer lopez]
Friends of mine say to me
Say you got control over me
You're not alone, I played my part
Saw the way you were from the start
Cause I expect so much from you
You had a girl when I first met you
Did the best that you could do
Now I realize that I can't change you
I used to say I didn't do it but I did it (yes I did)
Telling everybody that I wasn't with it (oh yeah)
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And I know inside that I'm gonna be alright (gonna be alright)
I said I didn't do it but I did it (yes I did)
Telling everybody that I wasn't with it (oh yeah)
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright (gonna be alright)
[jennifer lopez]
Said I wouldn't walk away
Some days I want to stay (days I want to stay)
But leaving you is what I need to do (need to do)
To be ok (I need to be ok)
I never thought it would be true (would be true)
Be leaving without you (leaving without you)
[nas]
Huh, this life is crazy
[jennifer lopez]
So now it's time for me to make that move
[nas]
Huh check it
Yo nobody understands me, I'm dealin' with pressure
My peoples is locked in a jail cell with no bail stressin'
Guess it's the life of a kingpin
Rap stephen king, rock bling
Like neon lights, we gon' be alright
But it's like you feelin' lesser
Claim I'm actin' like a retard
Writin' me and my boys
We start fights, with will I'm in charge
You scream I'm in the streets all night
Or where was I at, ya found light brown hairs on my hat
I'm slow caught
I used to say I didn't do it but I did it (yes I did)
Telling everybody that I wasn't with it (oh yeah)
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And I know inside that I'm gonna be alright (gonna be alright)
I said I didn't do it but I did it (yes I did)
Telling everybody that I wasn't with it (oh yeah)
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright (gonna be alright)
