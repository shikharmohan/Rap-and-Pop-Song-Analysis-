i will never bother you
i will never promise to
i will never follow you
i will never bother you
never speak a word again
i will crawl away for good
i will move away from here 
you wont be afraid of fear
no thought was put into this
i always knew we`d come to this
things have never been so swell
i have never failed to fail 
pain(3)
you know your right(3)
i`m so warm and calm inside
i know longer have to hide
lets talk about someone else
steaming soon begins to melt
nothing really bothers her she just wants to love herself
i will move away from here
you wont be afraid of fear
no thought was put into this
i always knew we1d come to this
thing have never been so swell
i have never faild to fail
pain(alot)
you know your right(alot)
