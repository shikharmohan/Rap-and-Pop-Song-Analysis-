Been on the loosing side
This time I'll turn the tide
This time I won't give up
No baby
This time I'm in control
I want the whole world to know
Aint know one to slow me down this time
This worlds gonna be my light
Theres a brand new stream ive found
And i aint looking back
[Chorus:]
And if the river's too wide, I'll get through it
And if the mountain's too high, that won't stop the stream of mine
I'm on my way, I've got a plan
I'm making my way any way that I can
This time around (This Is It Baby) 
Stand my ground , live my dream
Ive relised how i lie deep in me...
I will never turn at one , 
Theres nothing i can over come
Lets theses cats keep bumping dawns
I'll just grind on and get it done
I will never turn as one 
Theres nothing i cant overcome
Aint nothing to slow me down this time
sweet faith is on side
Giving it all i got
Blinding is dead
Straight to the top I'll get trought it ( Cum'on Baby )
[Chorus:]
And if the river's too wide, I'll get through it
And if the mountain's too high, that won't stop the stream of mine
I'm on my way, I've got a plan
I'm making my way any way that I can
