FREAK
This is for my tail clappers, mail stackers
Ass shakers, cash makers, who blast Vegas
Yo, this is for the freaks baby, petite ladies
Even my cellulite ladies, this is Tech N9ne, baby
When I was 5 years old,
My uncle snuck me into a drive-in show
Got in without pay I hid between Jimmy and Babe Roe
A triple X flick didn't even know what I was in for
Yo
I seen some things that made me feel kinda funny inside
I seen some things that my momma wouldn't want me
To see at this size, I seen some stuff, homeboys in the back
Was huffin' and puffin', windows foggy
Didn't know when I come of age, I'd be a gluten for muffins
Homeboy when I seen this I mean this
I was really shocked
And my teammate was really fiendish
It got really hot
Feelin' blanket a little squeamish
But I didn't want it to stop
My uncle said now, Tez don't piss your pants
Everybody laughed and presented to watch
Went back to school yo, the next day
Didn't look at home girls the same way
Started askin' neighbors can they girls come out to play
Instead of hide and go seek, it's hide and get it with no delay
I grew this thing called freaky, y'all
Sex on my brain, it was the best thing
I caught it when I was young an honorary
Just a baby havin' nasty dreams
I heard it was a Zodiac thing they say
Scorpio's are known to be freaks
I see somethin' lookin' good I say dwam
And when I see that ass hop I get geek
Time kept her movin' though my shell is closed
Fly looking at young girlie's saying her tail is swole
I am already sittin' there hopin' that hell is cold
N9ne lost his virginity when he was 12 years old
Wit a girl named Marlene, me and her was starvin'
For each other under the covers cooped up like sardines
My hard thing started bargin', farted was retarded
When it spit on her we started to arguin'
Here's a message to the young folks
Don't try this at home
Don't start it early like Tech N9ne
Wait till you are grown
When I was in high school
I'd wake up in the mornin' after I took a shower
I'd put on a non-lubricated condom
'Cause it could be on at any hour
In my brain is like a disease
I see a fine girl walking by I'm on her like freeze
I ain't gotta let her know I write hits or I got cheese
All she gotta do is look into my eyes
Get her hypnotized and watch her open them LEG's
I grew this thing called freaky, y'all
Sex on my brain, it was the best thing
I caught it when I was young an honorary
Just a baby havin' nasty dreams
I heard it was a Zodiac thing they say
Scorpio's are known to be freaks
I see somethin' lookin' good I say dwam
And when I see that ass hop I get geek
Nowadays I'm off up in adult clubs, I cannot shake it
Pretty women I wanna give 'em more love, I cannot fake it
Freaky virus you got me off in lust when that's where you bring us
Got me lovin' really big bust and that cunnilingus
I still be watching pornos, eatin' Digiornos
My hormones been runnin' wild since the day that I was born on
Tossed ya, broke it off ya in the kitchen, I'ma post ya
On the sink we breakin' dishes, Michael Douglas and Glenn Close, ya
Do you really wanna get up in the bed wit a psycho sex fiend
If you never wanna do it in the flesh we could do it in a wet dream
Im'ma get up in your brain no pain it'll be me and you, cha, cha
In a minute before I get in it
I'm gonna tell you boo what I really wanna do I wanna
I grew this thing called freaky, y'all
Sex on my brain, it was the best thing
I caught it when I was young an honorary
Just a baby havin' nasty dreams
I heard it was a Zodiac thing they say
Scorpio's are known to be freaks
I see something lookin' good I say dwam
And when I see that ass hop I get geek
Scorpios Aquarius, Gemini, Cancer
Leo, Virgo, Libra, Taurus, Capricorn
Sagittarius, Pisces, Aries
I see somethin' lookin' good I say dwam
And when I see that ass hop I get geek
