I'm coming 'round
And now my vision is so clear
If I could change my state of mind
Then I would disappear
The love I get from you
Is something I can't change
And I could let you slip away
Without a second glance
Why can't I realize
I'm fighting for my life?
Why can't I realize
I'm fighting for my life?
This is like a flashback
This is like a dream
This is like all the things you can fit
Inside a memory
This is like a flashback
This is like a dream
This is like all the things you can fit
Inside a memory
This is like a flashback, flashback
This is like a flashback, flashback
Why can't I realize
I'm fighting for my life?
Why can't I realize
I'm fighting for my life?
This is like a flashback
This is like a dream
This is like all the things you can fit
Inside a memory
This is like a flashback
This is like a dream
This is like all the things you can fit
Inside a memory
