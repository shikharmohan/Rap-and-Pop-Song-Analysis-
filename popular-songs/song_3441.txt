There's nothin' here to catch me now
I'm gonna fall anyway
It's just that kind of day
You might not know me good
But you know me good enough
To make me okay, okay
Just close your eyes
And put you lovin' on me
Put your lovin' on me
Take this weight off me
And put your lovin' on me
There's a chance that you might see
Somethin' rollin' off my cheek
But don't stop, it's not you
Make me forget, be my drug
Get me high on your touch
For the night, alright
Just close your eyes
And put you lovin' on me
Put your lovin' on me
Take this weight off me
And put your lovin' on me
Hey, hey, hey
Put your lovin' on me
Put your lovin' on me
Put your lovin' on me
Put your lovin' on me
Take this weight off me
And put your lovin' on me
There's nothing here to catch me now
I'm gonna fall, anyway
