This song is mary and i's themesong! it epitomizes
Our friendship through and through!
I know sometimes I'm like a child
I disappoint you so
And how you keep forgiving me
I'll never never know
When I stumble and I fall
And need love desperately
You are always there for me
Chorus:
Like an oak in the wind
Like an old familiar friend
Like a harbor in a wild and raging sea
Darlin' you are always there for me
When I take your love for granted
Like I often do
It's not that I don't need you so
It's not I don't love you
It's just that I'm a fool sometimes
Just too blind to see
That you are always there for me
Repeat chorus x2
