Mmm, mmm
Oh, oh
Listen
I know it's past tense, it's been a minute since
We were a couple and walking and holding hands
Kisses and I love you's, doing what lovers do, baby
But baby that was then
'Cause now we don't talk no more
You got a new man and
It shouldn't bother me
But girl it's driving me crazy
And everybody says
Boy why don't you just leave it alone
But I don't think I can
Sit up all night thinkin' 'bout you and
I know it ain't right baby but I don't
I don't think that I don't think I can let go
Sit up all night thinkin' 'bout you and
I know it ain't right baby but I don't
I don't think that I can let go
I'm holding on to hope, I know it's foolish though
Thinking that someday she might come back
Wish on it all the time knowin' it never may happen
But see I'm not a fool
'Cause no we don't talk no more
You got a new man but
I'm gonna keep the faith I've got the patience
That some lack
But everybody says
Boy why don't you just leave it alone
But I don't think I can
Sit up all night thinkin' 'bout you and
I know it ain't right baby but I don't
I don't think that I don't think I can let go
Sit up all night thinkin' 'bout you and
I know it ain't right baby but I don't
I don't think that I can let go
Don't think that I can let you go, oh no
I don't think that I can let go
And everybody says hey
I don't think that I can let go
Sit up all night thinkin' 'bout you and
I know it ain't right baby but I don't
I don't think that I don't think I can let go
Sit up all night thinkin' 'bout you and
I know it ain't right baby but I don't
I don't think that I can let go
And I don't think that I can let you
Said, I don't think that I can let you
No, don't think, don't think I can let go
Sing again, sing it again
I don't think that I can let you go
Don't think
