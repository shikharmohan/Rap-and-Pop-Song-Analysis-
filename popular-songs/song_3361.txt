(As performed on the 2007 Academy of Country Music Awards)
You're reading this, my mama's sittin there
Look's like I only got a one way ticket over here
I sure wish I could give you one more kiss
War was just a game we played when we were kids
Well I'm layin down my gun and hanging up my boots
I'm up here with God and we're both watching over you
So lay me down
In that open field out on the edge of town
And know my soul 
Is where my mama always prayed that it would go
And if you're reading this
I'm already home
If you're reading this halfway around the world
I won't be there to see the birth of our little girl
I hope she looks like you
I hope she fights like me
And stands up for the innocent and the weak
I'm layin down my gun and hanging up my boots
Tell dad I don't regret that I followed in his shoes
So lay me down
In that open field out on the edge of town
And know my soul 
Is where my mama always prayed that it would go
And if you're reading this
I'm already home
If you're reading this, there's gonna come a day
When you'll move on and find someone else, and that's ok
Just remember this
I'm in a better place
Where soldiers live in peace and angels sing Amazing Grace
So lay me down
In that open field out on the edge of town
And know my soul 
Is where my mama always prayed that it would go
And if you're reading this
If you're reading this...
I'm already home
