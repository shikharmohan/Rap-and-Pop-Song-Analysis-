A word's just a word
'Til you mean what you say
And love isn't love
'Til you give it away
We've all gotta give
Yes, something to give
To make a change
Send it on, on and on
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part, reach a heart
Just one spark starts a fire
With one little action
The chain reaction will never stop
Make it strong
Shine a light, and send it on
Just smile, and the world
  (Just smile, and the world)
Will smile along with you
That small act of love
Is meant for one who will become two
If we take the chances
To change circumstances
Imagine all we can do
If we send it on, on and on
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part, reach a heart
Just one spark starts a fire
With one little action
The chain reaction will never stop
Make it strong
Shine a light, and send it on
Send it on, ooh, send it on
There's power in all
Of all the choices we make
So I'm starting now
There's not a moment to waste
A word's just a word
'Til you mean what you say
And love isn't love
'Til you give it away
Send it on, on and on
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part, reach a heart
Just one spark starts a fire
With one little action
The chain reaction will never stop
Make it strong
Shine a light, and send it on
Send it on, on and on
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part, reach a heart
Just one spark starts a fire
With one little action
The chain reaction will help things start
Make it strong
Shine a light, and give it on
Shine a light, and send it on
Shine a light, and send it on
