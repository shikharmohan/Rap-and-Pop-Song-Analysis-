Sometimes I don't understand
Feels like I'm living in a world gone mad
Look around, all around it's just the same
People just rush everywhere
No time to ever take the time to care
We're the ones, we're the losers in this game
So where is the tenderness we sacrifice for progress
And where is the love we need, you know it makes me wonder
What if everybody, what if everybody reached out with just one hand?
(Reached with just one hand)
What if everybody, what if everybody sang out with just one voice?
(Sang with just one voice)
Maybe we could change things
What if everybody, what if everybody cared with just one heart?
(Cared with their own heart)
What if everybody, what if everybody tried to light one spark?
(Tried to light one spark)
Maybe we could change things somehow
Somehow it's all up to us, gotta take this world
Make it a world of love, gotta do it now
Gotta find a way to make a change somehow
There's gotta be a way for us to make it better
What if everybody, what if everybody reached out with just one hand?
(Reached with just one hand)
What if everybody, what if everybody sang out with just one voice?
(Sang with just one voice)
Maybe we could change things
What if everybody, what if everybody cared with just one hear?t
(Cared with their own heart)
What if everybody, what if everybody tried to light one spark?
(Tried to light one spark)
Maybe we could change things somehow
Here in our hearts, oh, the answer is there
If we only would look inside them
We can make it better, we can make it better
If we try together
What if everybody, what if everybody reached out with just one hand?
(Reached with just one hand)
What if everybody, what if everybody sang out with just one voice?
(Sang with just one voice)
Maybe we could change things
What if everybody, what if everybody cared with just one heart?
(Cared with their own heart)
What if everybody, what if everybody tried to light one spark?
(Tried to light one spark)
Maybe we could change things somehow
