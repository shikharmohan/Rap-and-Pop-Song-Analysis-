I grew up on the edge of a cornfield
At the end of a long dirt road
Carolina plow boy
Ain't had a free summer since I was ten years old
Mama made us pick our own switches
So we could feel the sting of doin' wrong
That set me straight on the road I'm still on
I am who I am
The product of a good woman loved by a real good man
I've learned what I've learned
By findin' the right way in all of my wrong turns
I love what I love
I ain't afraid to say it 'cause I'm damn sure man enough
That's what you need to see to get a picture of me
I grew up on gospel 'cause that's all my daddy'd listen to
I found my soul in rock and roll
When me and my first guitar were introduced
Truth is I've only loved one woman
And she'd have stayed, but I made her leave
She's still hauntin' me in every song I sing
I am who I am
The product of a woman still loved by a stubborn man
I've learned what I've learned
By findin' the right way in all of my wrong turns
I love what I love
I ain't afraid to say it 'cause I'm damn sure man enough
That's what you need to see to get a picture of me
Like me or leave me
Either way you know it the second you shake my hand
I'm a long way from Jesus
But I know He knows I'm doin' the best I can
I am who I am
The product of the good Lord lovin' a sinful man
I've learned what I've learned
By findin' the right way in all of my wrong turns
I love what I love
I ain't afraid to say it 'cause I'm damn sure man enough
That's what you need to see
That's what you need to see to get a picture of me
