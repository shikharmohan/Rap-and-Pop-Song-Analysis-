Don't like waiting, Don't like waiting let's go right now
Gotta hit the ground dancing 'fore the music slows down
What I'm saying, What I'm saying if there's something to fix
Take it to another level this is the remix
Everybody, Everybody get out on the floor
It can get a little crazy and when the kick hits the floor
Make a scene, Make a scene nobody can ignore
Don't knock it till you rock it we can't take it no more
(Chorus)
Bring the lights up,Bust the doors down
Dust yourself off ,Shake it up shake it up
DJ set it up Take it up a notch
All together now, Shake it up shake it up
(Shake it off)
Break it down, break it down I've got something to say
When you're dancing with me it's like we go MIA
Make a scene, Make a scene nobody can ignore
Don't knock it till you rock it we can't take it no more
(Chorus)
Sh-sh-sh-shake it up, You gotta change it up
And if the days not right just brush it off all night
Put on your attitude, Your in my pocket mood
And when you've had enough, Sh-sh-sh-shake it up
(Chorus Slow)
(Chorus) X2
(Shake it up, Shake it up)
(Shake it up, Shake it up)
(Shake it up, Shake it up)
