You're not worth it, babe
Trouble you bring, the noise you keep
And you don't even care, yeah
I'm so sick of you, babe
Nights wasted, I'm through faking
You don't turn me on
You don't do anything at all
Baby, I can't stand the sight of your face
Baby, I don't even wanna hear your name
Don't know what I saw
But are you seeing it now?
Woke up this morning
Bitterness in my mouth
Guess, I fell too fast
Guess, I learned my lesson
So much for true love
I'll take this Chivas instead, yeah
I'll take this Chivas instead, oh yeah
You're too high maintenance, babe
All the time you spent trying to fit in
And no one even cares, yeah
It's so ridiculous, babe
Watching you turn as I burn
It's like you're not even there, yeah
Baby, don't you try and hold my hand
Maybe you should keep your eyes
On your new girlfriend
Don't know what I saw
But are you seeing it now
Woke up this morning
Bitterness in my mouth
Guess, I fell too fast
Guess, I learned my lesson
So much for true love
I'll take the Chivas instead
I'll take the Chivas instead over your bed
It wasn't even good, trust me
I must have been so, so, so, so lonely
You are crap, yeah
You should keep your eyes
On your new little friend
And it's hard not to look I know
I'm amazing
I love you, Chivas
