You're the last thing that I cling to
Before I fall asleep at night
You're the first thing that I reach for
In the early mornin' light
You're the name that I see written in the stars
You're the face that I see in every cloud
Oh, I wish you could have been more like your memory
And kept hangin' around
You're that tap on my shoulder
You're that voice in the crowd
You're that constant distraction
You're that book I can't put down
You're the name that I see written in the stars
You're the face that I see in every cloud
Oh, I wish you could have been more like your memory
And kept hangin' around
It keeps haunting me
I still want and need you, always will
You're every, thought I think
Every sight I see, every feelin' I feel
You're the name that I see written in the stars
You're the face that I see in every cloud
Oh, I wish you could have been more like your memory
And kept hangin' around
You're the last thing that I wish for
When I lay down at night
