Rockn' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
The mistle toe hung were you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Rockn' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
later we'll have some pumpkin pie
and we'll do some caroling
you'll get a sentimental feeling when you hear
singing " Let's be jolly Decks the houls of holly"
Rockn' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
everyone dancin' merily
in the new old-fashiond way
you'll get a sentimental feeling when you hear
singing " Let's be jolly Decks the houls of holly"
Rockn' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
everyone dancin' merily
in the new old-fashiond way
