You know, I am a dreamer
When my heart is gold
I had to run away high
so I wouldn't come home low
Just when things went right
Doesn't mean they were always wrong
Just take this song
And you'll never feel left all alone
Take me to your heart
Feel me in your bones
Just one more night
And I'm coming off this long and winding road
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
Tonight , Tonight
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
You know that I seen
So many romantic dreams
Up in lights
Fallin' off the silver screen
My heart's like an open book
For the whole world to read
Sometimes nothing , that keeps me
Together at the seams
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
Tonight , Tonight
I'm on my way
To set me free
Home sweet home
Ooooo
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
Yeaa
I'm on my way
To set me free
Home sweet home
