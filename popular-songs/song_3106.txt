All at once
You know inside
Let's ride, across the stars tonight
Love has been so long the way for us
So long you gonna know
And tonight, your soul is scared to ride
So first time saw you
Nothing makes love so true
All at once 
I needed you more than you know
all at once 
I needed to melt like a snow
All at once
I wanted you in my life
I hope that there's love tonight
All at once
I needed you in my dreams
All at once
I needed you to love me   
All at once
I wanted to fly so high
I hope there's more love tonight
.............tonight........
Strange of the eye
SO true
Fairytale so real
When you and I are dancing
You make me feel 
My kind of sky
Inside
A mericals' alive
When you look at me
Something is true to me
All at once 
I needed you more than you know
all at once 
I needed to melt like a snow
All at once
I wanted you in my life
I hope that there's love tonight
All at once
I needed you in my dreams
All at once
I needed you to love me   
All at once
I wanted to fly so high
I hope there's more love tonight
.............tonight........
