Looking back over the years
Of all the things I've always meant to say
But the words didn't come easily
So many times through empty fears
Of all of the nights I tried to pick up the phone
So scared of who might be answerin'
You try to live your life from day to day
  (Ooo ooo ooo ooo)
But seeing you across the room tonight
Just gives me away
'Cause the heart won't lie
An' sometimes life gets in the way
But there's one thing that won't change
  (Aaa aaa aaa aaa)
I know I've tried
  (Aaa aaa)
The heart won't lie
You can live your alibi
Who can see you're lost inside?
  (Ooo ooo ooo ooo)
A foolish disguise
  (Ooo ooo)
The heart won't lie
Long after tonight
Will you still hear my voice through the radio?
Old desires make us act carelessly
Long after the night, after the fire
After the scattered ashes fly
Through the four winds blown and gone
Will you come back to me?
You try to live your life from day to day
  (Ooo ooo ooo ooo)
But seeing you across the room tonight
Just gives me away
'Cause the heart won't lie
Sometimes life gets in the way
But there's one thing that won't change
  (Aaa aaa aaa aaa)
I know I've tried
  (Aaa aaa)
The heart won't lie
You can live your alibi
Who can see you're lost inside?
  (Ooo ooo ooo ooo)
A foolish disguise
  (Ooo ooo)
The heart won't lie
The heart won't lie
