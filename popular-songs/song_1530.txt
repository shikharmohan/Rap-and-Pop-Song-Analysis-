Ooooh, don't you think it's a pretty good plan
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan
Take me to the islands
Put my feet in the sand
Rockin' to and fro with the rhythm of the ocean
Singin' silent night with the palm trees a blowin'
Ooooh, don't you think it's a pretty good plan
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan
Well if you're thinkin' 'bout gettin' me a present this year
Let me put a bug in your cute little ear
How about two tickets to a tropical show
Where we don't have to wear these winter clothes anymore
Instead of turkey we'll have mahi mahi grillin'
And pina colodas in the blender chillin'
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan
Take me to the islands
Put my feet in the sand
Singin' silent night with the palm trees a blowin'
Ooooh, don't you think it's a pretty good plan
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan
Well everybody's prayin' for a Christmas so white
Come to think about it that would be alright
As long as there is sand not snow on the ground
And everyday our skin gets a little more brown
We'll string some lights in a coconut tree
I'll rub some oil on you and you can rub some on me
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan
I can see us baby on the beach hand in hand
Rockin' to and fro with the rhythm of the ocean
Baby whats you say you and me we'll be goin'
Ooooh, I can almost feel my toes in the sand
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan
And don't worry baby we'll celebrate plenty
I'll buy you some shades a brand new bikini
We won't have to worry about the holiday rush
It'll be you and me fallen' deeper in love
Ooooh, don't you think it's a pretty good plan
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan
