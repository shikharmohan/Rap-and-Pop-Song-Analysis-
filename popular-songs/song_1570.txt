You
Dont have to give up 
your dream 
to be 
what people want you to be
you 
dont have to change
the way you are
to impress
some guy that you like
Keep On dreaming if you think that should be true
keep on laughing if you know thats not you
keep on loving the way your are
dont change for somebody else
just be yourself
You
shouldnt worry
about
what other people think
you
shouldnt change
just

keep on dreaming if you think that should be true
keep on laughing if you know thats not you
keep on loving the way you are
dont change for somebody
just be yourself

the words i'm saying 
keep on dreaming if you think that should be true
keep on laughing if you know thats not you

Keeping on loving the way you are
