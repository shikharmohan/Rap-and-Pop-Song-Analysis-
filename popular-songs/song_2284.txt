I will never bother you
I will never promise too
I will never follow you
I will never bother you
Never speak a word again
I will crawl away for good
I will move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear
No thought was put into this
I always knew it would come to this
Things have never been so swell
I have never failed to fail
Pain, pain, pain
You know you're right
You know you're right
You know you're right
It's so warm and calm inside
I no longer have to hide
Let's talk about someone else
Steaming soup begins to melt
Nothing really bothers her
She just wants to love herself
I will move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear
No thought was put into this
I always knew it'd come like this
Things have never been so swell
I have never felt this real
Pain, pain, pain, pain, pain
You know you're right
You know you're right
You know you're right
Pain
