Strangers always got some mess to spread
But I have learned to flick them off
Can't walk a mile in my YSL's
I strap 'em on and I walk it off
Got 'em saying, "I can't believe she did it, no she didn't"
My wild factor's got 'em crazy
Got 'em saying, "Yeah, she did it but I can't believe it"
Never say you can't believe
Even if they try they still can't walk a mile in these shoes
They couldn't even lace 'em up right
Honey, these pumps are too big to fill
Ten million men can't walk a mile in these shoes
My strut's so fierce, Steven's gotten mad at me
Laugh and talk behind my back but they'll never get the best of me
I see 'em doing my dance and I hear 'em singing my song
I'm surpassing the rest 'cause that's how I was raised to do it
Got 'em saying, "I can't believe she did it, no she didn't"
My wild factor's got 'em crazy
Got 'em saying, "Yeah, she did it but I can't believe it"
Never say you can't believe
Even if they try they still can't walk a mile in these shoes
They couldn't even lace 'em up right
Honey, these pumps are too big to fill
Ten million men can't walk a mile in these shoes
Even if they try they still can't walk a mile in these shoes
They couldn't even lace 'em up right
Honey, these pumps are too big to fill
Ten million men can't walk a mile in these shoes
I'm walking tall, I don't let their hatred test me
They bite the dust, head above water they still can't breathe
My feet pound the ground as I stomp it out
I dare you to walk a mile in my shoes
Even if they try they still can't walk a mile in these shoes
They couldn't even lace 'em up right
Honey, these pumps are too big to fill
Ten million men can't walk a mile in these shoes
