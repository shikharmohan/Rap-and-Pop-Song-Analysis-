6 pounds and 9 ounces, lookin' up at me
Like I have all the answers
I hope, I have the ones you need
I've never really done this, now I know what scared is
Sometimes, I'll protect you from everything that's wrong
Other times, I'll let you just find out on your own
But that's when you'll be growin'
And the whole time I'll be knowin'
You're gonna fly with every dream you chase
You're gonna cry but know that that's okay
Sometimes life's not fair but if you hang in there
You're gonna see that sometimes bad is good
We just have to believe things work out like they should
Life has no guarantees, but always loved by me
You're gonna be
I'm afraid you'll have to suffer through some of my mistakes
Lord, knows I'll be trying, oh, to give you what it takes
What it takes to know the difference between getting by and livin'
'Cause anything worth doing is worth doing all the way
Just know you'll have to live with all the choices that you make
So make sure you're always givin' way more than you're takin'
You're gonna fly with every dream you chase
You're gonna cry, but know that that's okay
Sometimes life's not fair, but if you just hang in there
You're gonna see that sometimes bad is good
We just have to believe things work out like they should
Life has no guarantees, but always loved by me
You're gonna be
Someone's everything
You're gonna see
Just what you are to me
You're gonna fly with every dream you chase
We just have to believe things work out like they should
Life has no guarantees, but always loved by me
You're gonna be, always loved by me
