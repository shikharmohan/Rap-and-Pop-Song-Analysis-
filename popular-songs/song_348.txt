She never knew my name, least not the one my daddy gave me
I took off the way I came, moonlight reflectin' off the chrome
She didn't want my story so I didn't have to lie
If I loved her it was only for a night
Livin' life on the run
You can't give your heart to no one
Your only friend is the settin' sun
I didn't do what they said I done
I gotta stay one step ahead
Or one of these days I'm gonna wake up dead
Dropped in my tracks by a bullet from a lawman's gun
Oh, you can't rest a minute when you're livin' life on the run
The white lines on the road that's the only trail I leave behind me
Been chasin' high-line poles ever since the night I skipped out of town
Somewhere in the distance is where I need to be
All I care about right now is speed
Livin' life on the run
You can't give your heart to no one
Your only friend is the settin' sun
I didn't do what they said I done
I gotta stay one step ahead
Or one of these days I'm gonna wake up dead
Dropped in my tracks by a bullet from a lawman's gun
Oh, you can't rest a minute when you're livin' life on the run
Here we go
Here they come now, gotta lay low
Done bent the law till the law got broke
Here they come now, gotta lay low-ow-ow-ow-ow
Here they come now, they're closin' in
Pack of bloodhounds gonna catch my scent
Here they come now, now I'm gone again, yeah
Livin' life on the run
You can't give your heart to no one
You can't rest a minute when you're livin' life on the run
No, you can't rest a minute when you're livin' life on the run
