Love is a powerful word 
A little word that oughta mean something 
Love better mean what it says 
Say what you mean or it doesn't mean nothing 
Love's a dangerous door to open 
If you don't feel it when it's spoken 
Sometimes I said it when I really didn't mean it 
Just a throw away promise I knew wasn't true 
It meant a little less to me every time I did it 
But I never said "I love you" from the heart 
'Til I said it to you
You made me tell you the truth 
And that truth was a total revelation 
I see I have it in me 
Now I can speak without any hesitation 
"I love you" comes so freely 
For the first time I believe me 
Sometimes I said it when I really didn't mean it 
Just a throw away promise I knew wasn't true 
It meant a little less to me every time I did it 
But I never said "I love you" from the heart 
'Til I said it to you
Sometimes I said it when I really didn't mean it 
Just a throw away promise I knew wasn't true 
It meant a little less to me every time I did it 
But I never said "I love you" from the heart 
'Til I said it to you
