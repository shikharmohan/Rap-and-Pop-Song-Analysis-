Jimmy climbs on board of that old yellow bus
It sure looks big in his little eyes
His mama waits as her tears kick up the dust
It's never easy to say goodbye
Julie Raye in her pearl white wedding gown
Has found her wings and it's time to fly
It's all her dad can do to keep from breakin' down
It's never easy to say goodbye
It ain't easy, to ever say goodbye
It ain't easy lettin' go of the ones you love
But believe me we'll meet again by and by
If not here, somewhere up above
I've had friends that I lost along the way
They've been called on down the line
Though their time was short but I still think 'bout them everyday
It ain't easy to say goodbye
It ain't easy, to ever say goodbye
It ain't easy lettin' go of the ones you love
But believe me we'll meet again by and by
If not here, somewhere up above
The time has come to go our separate ways
And it's alright if you wanna cry
Though I know we'll meet again someday
It's never easy to say goodbye
It ain't easy, to ever say goodbye
It ain't easy lettin' go of the ones you love
But believe me we'll meet again by and by
If not here, somewhere up above
If not here, somewhere up above
