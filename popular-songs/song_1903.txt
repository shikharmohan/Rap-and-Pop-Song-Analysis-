You understand me at least you say you do
Lately that's enough for me
Looking for perfect surrounded by artificial
You're the closest thing to real I see
Sure everyone has their problems, that's a given
Yours are the easiest to tolerate
This wasn't what we we were wanting, how we're living
But let's take this good enough and turn it to great, baby understand
This can only be as good as we both make it
Yes, sometimes it's gonna hurt
Yes, sometimes it's gonna hurt
We can be as happy as we want to be, girl
But we gotta make it work
We gotta make it work, ay oh ay oh oh
We gotta make it work, ay oh ay oh oh
We gotta make it work, ay oh ay oh oh
We gotta make it work, ay oh ay oh oh
Sometimes I love you more than you'll ever know
Other times you get on my nerves
Hey, that's just reality, no, it can't always be
Kisses, hugs and beautiful words
You was looking for your prince, what you found
Is a pauper with potential
And no, I'm nowhere near perfect but I'm around
Girl, time and patience is essential, baby realize
This can only be as good as we both make it
Yes, sometimes it's gonna hurt
Yes, sometimes it's gonna hurt
Hey, we can be as happy as we want to be, girl
But we gotta make it work
We gotta make it work, ay oh ay oh oh
We gotta make it work, ay oh ay oh oh
We gotta make it work, ay oh ay oh oh
We gotta make it work, ay oh ay oh oh
Thick and thin
The bad outweighs the good sometimes
That doesn't mean we're supposed to give it up
My problems are yours and yours are mine
This can only be as good as we both make it
Yes, sometimes it's gonna hurt
Yes, sometimes it's gonna hurt
Hey, we can be as happy as we want to be, girl
But we gotta make it work
We gotta make it work, ay oh ay oh oh
We gotta make it work, ay oh ay oh oh
We gotta make it work, ay oh ay oh oh
We gotta make it work, ay oh ay oh oh
