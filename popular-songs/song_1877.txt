Keep moving on [x3]
Time's gonna keep on passing
These moments are gonna stop lasting
I don't know why I'm counting
The seconds go by
I don't need to know the why's and wherefores
I think I finally found the cure
For this heartache
Heartache so impossible
I didn't know it wasn't so plausible
When I think everything's done
And I've won the races I've run
People will put up walls
And there'll still be obstacles
When I've
Learned all what thought was all to know
Finally forgot all my sorrows
Time tells it's not the end of the road
'Cause I still have miles to go
I'm getting tired of all the lies
But I'm still gonna try
'Cause there's no going back
On this endless track
I'm gonna have to pass
And the wind will always sing
A song of never knowing
Where your going
When I think everything's done
And I've won the races I've run
People will put up walls
And there'll still be obstacles
When I've
Learned all what thought was all to know
Finally forgot all my sorrows
Time tells it's not the end of the road
'Cause I still have miles to go
I got miles to go
Miles to go
So much  more to know
And I'm taking it in real slow
ohh oh
When I think everything's done
And I've won the races I've run
People will put up walls
And there'll still be obstacles
When I've
Learned all what thought was all to know
Finally forgot all my sorrows
Time tells it's not the end of the road
'Cause I still have miles to go
Keep moving on [x3]
