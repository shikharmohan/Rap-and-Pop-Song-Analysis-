Thought I'd get to see your face again
But my flight got canceled, wouldn't stop rainin'
So two days, three flights later I touchdown
But there was trouble with your family and now your outta town
And I don't like it, no this ain't cool
Feelin' like somethin', just don't want me near you
The world keeps gettin' in the way
Tryin' to get to you but it seems like everyday is somethin' new
Baby the world keeps gettin' in the way
With you is where I wanna be but it just won't let me
'Cause it keeps gettin' in the way
Keeps gettin' in the way, said it keep gettin' in the way
Keeps gettin' in the way
Keeps gettin' in the way, said it keeps gettin' in the way
And now we're in the same state
But I be in the studio workin' extra late
5 in the mornin' and finally I get to leave, I'm comin' home to you
But by the time I get there you're already fast asleep
And I don't like it, no this ain't cool
Feelin' like there's somethin', just don't want me near you
The world keeps gettin' in the way
Tryin' to get to you but it seems like everyday there's somethin' new
Baby the world keeps gettin' in the way
With you is where I wanna be but it just won't let me
'Cause it keeps gettin' in the way
Keeps gettin' in the way, said it keeps gettin' in the way
Keeps gettin' in the way
Keeps gettin' in the way, said it keeps gettin' in the way
Keeps gettin' in the way, said it keeps gettin' in the way
Keeps gettin' in the way
Keeps gettin' in the way, said it keeps gettin' in the way
Oh, and I don't like it, no this ain't cool
Feelin' like there's somethin', just don't want me near you, you, you
Baby the world keeps gettin' in the way
Tryin' to get to you but it seems like everyday there's somethin' new
Baby the world keeps gettin' in the way
With you is where I wanna be but it just won't let me
Said it keeps gettin' in the way
Keeps gettin' in the way, said it keeps gettin' in the way
Keeps gettin' in the way
Keeps gettin' in the way, said it keeps gettin' in the way
Keeps gettin' in the way, said it keeps gettin' in the way
Keeps gettin' in the way
Keeps gettin' in the way, said it keeps gettin' in the way
Keeps gettin' in the way
Keeps gettin' in the way, I said it keeps gettin' in the way
Keeps gettin' in the way
