I thought I told you, Imma a star
You see that ice? You see the cars
Flashy lights everywhere we are
Livin' like, like there's no tomorrow
I thought I told you, Imma a star
You see that ice? You see the cars
Flashy lights everywhere we are
Livin' like, like there's no tomorrow
Oh, I got money, I don't need a Range
I'm a pimp, I don't need a cane
Be it kills Charlie, you can keep the change
Now that I got the torch, Imma keep the flame
Imma keep my aim, gotta make the big shots
In my latest suit, Louie V flip flops
Got a bad bitch, her hair and nails tip top
Jeremih got the game on a slipknot
Just before the stacks, I got rubber bands
Consumers only want you to supply demand
So here I am, check my DNA
Gettin' money's the only thing on my resume
I thought I told you Imma a star
You see that ice? You see the cars
Flashy lights everywhere we are
Livin' like, like there's no tomorrow
I thought I told you Imma a star
You see that ice? You see the cars
Flashy lights everywhere we are
Livin' like, like there's no tomorrow
Like the dealership, I got beaucoup cars
Penitentiary, I keep beaucoup bars
Flow so hot, ridin' beaucoup lot
Hollywood ground, I got beaucoup stars
Don't need Roger Ebert or the paparazzi
Take on in the red at the county stop me
I hit hella licks, man hella stagin'
Hit the weed man so you get in touch with Mary Jane
You a Scorpio? Girl, get over here
And ride me all night like you kin of Paul Revere
Kissin' on my neck, nibblin' on my ear
You say you wanna chill? Go ahead and have a beer
I thought I told you Imma a star
You see that ice? You see the cars
Flashy lights everywhere we are
Livin' like, like there's no tomorrow
I thought I told you Imma a star
You see that ice? You see the cars
Flashy lights everywhere we are
Livin' like, like there's no tomorrow
Now if you back it up, shawty Imma stack it up
If you back it up shawty, Imma stack it up
Imma stack it up, but only if you back it up
Flashy lights everywhere we are
Everywhere we are
Flashy lights everywhere we are
Everywhere we are
Oh, okay now, I'll be ballin', I'll be, I'll be ballin'
You can catch me in the air, I'll be ballin'
When I'm tryin' to buy some gear, I'll be mallin'
In the middle of the club with one dollar, you call it
Either the cameras flickin' or the police clockin'
Especially at the end of the month when it's just not a option
Now they got the spotlight on me, why they put that on me?
Now I'm never lonely 'cause everywhere I go there is
Flashy lights everywhere we are
Everywhere we are
Flashy lights everywhere we are
Everywhere we are
