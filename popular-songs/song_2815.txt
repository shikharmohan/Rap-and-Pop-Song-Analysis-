They met at a party
He was laughin' with his friends
She captured all of his attention
Just by walkin' in
Confident and self-assured
He liked her attitude
And the moment their eyes met
Every girl in the room became
Invisible just out of view
Invisible like a pane of glass
He could see right through
Invisible
They married in October
She made a beautiful bride
His whole world revolved around her
They had a picture perfect life
But when the baby came in August
Time started spinnin' like a wheel
She expected to feel tired
But she never thought she'd feel
Invisible just out of view
Invisible like a pane of glass
He could see right through
Invisible
'Cause lately he's been overlookin' quite a lot
So tonight in lace and candlelight
She'll prove to him she's not
Invisible just out of view
Invisible like a pane of glass
He could see right through
Invisible
A love deep inside
(Invisible)
So much more to her than meets the eye
Invisible
Invisible
Invisible
