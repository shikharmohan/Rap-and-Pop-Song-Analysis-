Every time I look up
He be slidin' through in the F one fifty pickup
On them things shinin' with the crazy bangin' system
Laid back reclinin' with his arm up out the window like ooh
Every time he calls, I pick up
When he doesn't I be quick to double check my signal
Hold it out the window and pull up my antenna
I'm so gone gotta hit 'em, I'm infatuated with 'em
And ooh, I never felt this before
Ooh ooh baby, ooh ooh baby
Don't know what to do with you baby
You just got me actin' so crazy
And I think this could be love, this could be love
Ooh ooh baby, ooh ooh baby
I just cant say no to you baby
Whatever you want I'm so gone, I can't think
And I think it might be love, this could be love
Say baby you're like
Part of the couple I've been missin' all of my life
You're like a brother but my lover, you are my gay right
I'm like an addict gotta have it when I go my body goes
Uh oh, oh no
See you give me such a good vibe
When the drama sittin' ridin' on the B ride
I'll still be with you even if you pockets ain't tight
I may be young but I know love and you're the one
And boy you really got me feelin' so right
Ooh ooh baby, ooh ooh baby
Don't know what to do with you, baby
You just got me actin' so crazy
And I think this could be love, this could be love
Ooh ooh baby, ooh ooh baby
I just cant say no to you baby
Whatever you want I'm so gone I can't think
And I think it might be love, this could be love
Ooh ooh baby, ooh baby baby
Got me actin' up, I'm diggin' on you
I don't know what to do
Ooh baby, ooh baby baby
Got me actin' up don't know what to do
You got me so in love, 'cause I'm diggin' on you
I'm so in love
Ooh ooh baby, ooh ooh baby
Don't know what to do with you baby
You just got me actin' so crazy
And I think this could be love, this could be love
Ooh ooh baby, ooh ooh baby
I just cant say no to you baby
Whatever you want I'm so gone I can't think
And I think it might be love, this could be love
Ooh ooh baby, ooh ooh baby
Don't know what to do with you baby
You just got me actin' so crazy
And I think this could be love
Ooh ooh baby, ooh ooh baby
I just can't say no to you baby
Whatever you want I'm so gone I can't think
And I think it might be love, this could be love
