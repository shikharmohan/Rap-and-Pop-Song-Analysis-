Hello world, hope you're listening
Forgive me if I'm young or speaking out of turn
But there's someone I've been missing
And I think that they could be the better half of me
They're in the wrong place tryin' to make it right
But I'm tired of justifying
So I say to you, come home, come home
'Cause I've been waiting for ya for so long, for so long
And right now there's a war between the vanities
But all I see is you and me
And the fight for you is all I've ever known
So come home
I get lost in the beauty of everything I see
The world ain't half as bad as they paint it to be
If all the sons and all the daughters stop to take it in
Well hopefully the hate subsides and the love can begin
It might start now, yeah
Or maybe I'm just dreaming out loud
But until then come home, come home
'Cause I've been waiting for ya for so long, for so long
And right now there's a war between the vanities
But all I see is you and me
And the fight for you is all I've ever known, ever known
So come home, ooh
Everything I can't be is everything you should be
And that's why I need you here
Everything I can't be is everything you should be
And that's why I need you here
So hear this now, come home, come home
'Cause I've been waiting for ya for so long, for so long
And right now there's a war between the vanities
But all I see is you and me
And the fight for you is all I've ever known, ever known
So come home, come home
