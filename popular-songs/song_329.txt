It's serious
I don't care if you're in your car
I don't care if you're on the dance floor
And it don't matter who you are, it takes you over
It's crazy, what could you be doing?
Tell how, come you're not moving?
Energy, let the music get you high
It moves you when you see the flashing lights
It feels so good I can't control my waist
I can't control my hips, it makes me want to break
And therefore I proceed to break it down
And therefore I proceed to break it down
And therefore I proceed to break it down
And therefore I proceed to break it down
I bet you're curious
How I pop so hard and make my back break
It's in the beat, why aren't you hearing this?
Hit me so hard you feel the big bass
It's crazy what could you be doing
Tell how come you're not moving
Energy, let the music get you high
It moves you when you see the flashing lights
It feels so good I can't control my waist
I can't control my hips, it makes me want to break
And therefore I proceed to break it down
And therefore I proceed to break it down
And therefore I proceed to break it down
And therefore I proceed to break it down
I'm lookin' for my lover, someone I can call my dream
And like a brother also treats me like a best friend
He ain't got another, 'cause I'm the only one for him
Feels like magic when we're holding hands
He touch my heart
It makes me move
He makes it pop
And makes me groove
It's crazy, what could you be doing?
Tell how, come you're not moving?
Energy, let the music get you high
It moves you when you see the flashing lights
It feels so good I can't control my waist
I can't control my hips, it makes me want to break
And therefore I proceed to break it down
And therefore I proceed to break it down
And therefore I proceed to break it down
And therefore I proceed to break it down
I'm lookin' for my lover, someone I can call my dream
And like a brother also treats me like a best friend
He ain't got another, 'cause I'm the only one for him
Feels like magic when we're holding hands
He touch my heart
It makes me move
He makes it pop
And makes me groove
It's crazy, what could you be doing?
Tell how, come you're not moving?
Energy, let the music get you high
It moves you when you see the flashing lights
It feels so good I can't control my waist
I can't control my hips, it makes me want to break
And therefore I proceed to break it down
And therefore I proceed to break it down
And therefore I proceed to break it down
And therefore I proceed to break it down
It feels so good I can't control my waist
I can't control my hips, it makes me want to break
And therefore I proceed to break it down
And therefore I proceed to break it down
