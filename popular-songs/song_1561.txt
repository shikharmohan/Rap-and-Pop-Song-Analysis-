Well I believe in love, but not the kinda screws you up, no!
I believe in time and chance, cuz I'm not one for making plans
I believe in moving on when sentimental and love is gone
But if I'm crying over you
I won't lie even it's hard to do
When you turn around I'll be gone and I mean goodbye
I see you in another life
I see you in another life
I don't know here I'm going but when you turn around i'll be gone and I mean goodbye.
I believe in love but not the kinda breaks you up, no!
I don't regret the day I felt
Kiss the life, I wish you well
But if I'm crying over you
I won't lie even it's hard to do
When you turn around I'll be gone and i mean goodbye
I see you in another life
I see you in another life
I don't know here I'm going but when you turn around
I'll be gone and I mean goodbye.
Well I know you're full
full of good intensions yeah
But that don't change a thing cause I'm already out of head.
When you turn around I'll be gone and i mean goodbye
I see you in another life
I see you in another life
I don't know here I'm going but when you turn around
I'll be gone and I mean goodbye.
I see you in another life (x2)
