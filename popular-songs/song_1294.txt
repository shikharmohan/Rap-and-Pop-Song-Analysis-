I think you've touched my hand
or maybe hurt me again
what did you say that made me blush
I think you laughed at me
first dates are always fun
I think that when I fell in love
first kiss first moment that I knew
first time you said I love you
first day I started to forget
I still have all your pictures
sometimes I do remember
you come and go like all the rest
It's been so long since i left
I cant remember my way back
I'm so lost, I'm so lost
no where to go walkin' alone
without your love I have no home
I'm so lost, I'm so lost
sometimes I get a glance of
you and me and we're dancin'
as if things they never change
you hold me closer to you
I watch you fade and soon you
you just, you slip away
cause, It's been so long since I left
I cant remember my way back
I'm so lost, I'm so lost
no where to go walkin' alone
without your love I have no home
I'm so lost, I'm so lost
(ahh ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)
(ahh ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)
(ahh ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ahhhhhh)
It's been so long since I left
I cant remember my way back
I'm so lost, I'm so lost
no where to go walkin' alone
without your love I have no home
I'm so lost, I'm so lost
cause, its been so long since I left
I cant remember my way back
I'm so lost, I'm so lost
no where to go walkin' alone
without your love I have no home
I'm so lost, I'm so lost
