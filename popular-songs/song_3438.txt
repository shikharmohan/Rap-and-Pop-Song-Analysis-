Wake me my lady don't let me sleep
Open my eyes to the wonders you keep
Let me look at you, see how you shine
I'll fall in love like I've done every time
Lay me in soft green grass
Down where the river runs
Under the mountain caps
Gold with the setting sun
Walk me along the bay
Beyond the verdant trees
Carry me with your grace
Forever comfort me
You walk on water searching the east
Souls of the masses pass at your feet
Looking up at you, tears in their eyes
Fathers of fathers of fathers gone by
Walk me down old main street
Ride me down rusty rails
Fields full of summer wheat
Peppered with rounded bails
Steeples where church bells ring
Lighthouses by the sea
Reach out through gathered storms
Faithfully comfort me
I am your tired
I am your poor in spirit
Yearning to breathe
Breathe free, breathe free
Lay me in soft green grass
Down where the river runs
Under the mountain caps
Gold with the setting sun
Walk me along the bay
Beyond the verdant trees
Carry me with your grace
Forever comfort me
Walk me down old main street
Ride me down rusty rails
Fields full of summer wheat
Peppered with rounded bails
Steeples where church bells ring
Lighthouses by the sea
Reach out through gathered storms
Faithfully comfort me
Hey, comfort me
Comfort me
Comfort me
Comfort me
