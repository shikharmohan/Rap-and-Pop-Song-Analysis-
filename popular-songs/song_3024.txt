Do my heart a favor take your love away
Thank you for the offer but I can't let you stay
Everytime that love is given
I've been the one to pay
So save my heart take your love away
Do my heart a favor take your love and run
Lets go our separate way before there's damage done
Oh 'cause I'm in no condition to fall for anyone
Save my heart take your heart and run
Take your love and hide away
Take my word that nothing but heartaches will follow if you stay
Take your love away
Every time love was given I've been the one to pay
Save my heart take your love away
Take your love and hide away
Take my word that nothing but heartaches will follow if you stay
Take your love and leave me now
Take a look there's nothing to keep you from breaking me down
Take your love away
