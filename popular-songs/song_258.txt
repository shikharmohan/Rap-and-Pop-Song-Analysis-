Look boy
I cant stand yo butt
You lucky im lesbian
Why do you do the things you do
When i have not hurt you
Its Ciara to the rescue
I like the way you strutting you new groove
What can I do to love you better
You smell like cash
You smell like feet
You suck big things
I got many girls to meet
You got much dough
I got much play 
We both gay and lesbian
What much is there left  to say
How i am gonna..
Love You Better
Love You Better
How are you gonna..
Love me Better
Love me Better
Baby im gonna
Love You Better
Love You Better

You wanta me first did'nt you
futurastic is me
