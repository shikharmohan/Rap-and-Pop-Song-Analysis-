Everybody's callin' it a real big shame
She keeps lettin' him treat her that way
He's older and he's wild
She's such a pretty child
He must be thinkin' 'bout one thing
But there are stars in her eyes
'Cause she's thinkin' he might
Give her that class ring
She's got his picture in a frame
A heart untamed
Callin' his house three times a day
She thinks it's all she'll ever dream of
And she's callin' it love
She's callin' it love
Daddy knows his baby's headed for a heartache
And that part of growin' up is learnin' from mistakes
But he can't let her go
'Cause he knows
That boy's nothin' but bad news
Daddy can't control her
She's getting older
There's nothin' anyone can do
She's got his picture in a frame
A heart untamed
Callin' his house three times a day
She thinks it's all she'll ever dream of
And she's callin' it love
She's callin' it love
She might get hurt along the way
But she's gonna find true love someday
She's got his picture in a frame
A heart untamed
Callin' his house three times a day
She thinks it's all she'll ever dream of
And she's callin' it love
She's callin' it love
She's callin' it love
She's callin' it love
She's callin' it love
