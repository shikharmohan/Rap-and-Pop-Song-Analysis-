Sometimes I wonder, if everything changed
How would we make out?
And now suddenly thunder, and everything changed
There's this big dark cloud, hovering
Hovering, hovering, hovering
You always said that we'd make it through
Trembling, stumbling, fumbling
For the words that say that I'm leaving you, I'm leaving you
We go through the motions like everything's settled
But it's inside out and it makes us uncomfortable
Still holding on when there's all this doubt, hovering
Hovering, hovering, hovering
You always said that we'd make it through
Trembling, stumbling, fumbling
For the words that say that I'm leaving you, I'm leaving you
And maybe we're just older
(Older)
Just a little older
(Older)
'Cause the fact that this is over
The fact that this is over with you then
Hovering, hovering, hovering
You always said that we'd make it through
Trembling, stumbling, fumbling
For the words that say that I'm leaving you, I'm leaving you
Trembling, stumbling, fumbling
For the words that say that I'm leaving you
You always said that we'd make it through
You always said that we'd make it through
