I thought I was doing all right bein' alone
I swore I'd never let somebody get close again
I was never gonna let my guard down, not for anyone
But there's a light in your eyes and it's got me movin' in
And tonight these walls are all comin' down
And my heart is open, I'm lettin' you in
'Cause you give me a reason
And the faith I've been needing to start again
And your love is healin', I'm finally breathin'
I've been waitin' so long hopin' for this moment
My heart is open
These days it seems like everybody's just walking away
Like there's no forever and love is just a game
But don't you know that you can believe me when I say that I'm your man?
And my heart is open and I'm lettin' you in baby
'Cause you give me a reason
And the faith I've been needin' to start again
And your love is healin' I'm finally breathin'
And I've been waitin' so long hopin' for this moment
My heart is open
I can't wait anymore, no, no
'Cause I've got nothing left to prove and I've got so much left of you
That's why I'm tearing out the walls and baby I'm kicking down the doors
And your love is healin', baby I'm finally breathing
And I can hear you callin', I'm ready to fall in love again
And my heart is open, and my heart is open
My heart is open
