Yup, yup, can't do it, can't do it
She says she love me then she loves me not
But she don't hate me if I kick her out my spot
'Cause darlin' lately it seems we've been growin' apart
I don't know how much more I can take this
I feel like sayin' buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh bye
I feel like sayin' buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh bye
But when I look into her eyes, eye, eye, eye, eye, eyes
Just can't do it, do it, do it
Never felt this before, could it be that we lost the flame?
That them true lovers have, how did it all just slip away?
Seems so right at the beginnin', now it seems close to the endin'
Like we just friends, I need to breathe again, ooh yeah
These feelin's I'm feelin' startin' to drive me crazy
Just the thought of another man makin' other plans with my lady
And girl I've tried and tried hard so we can work this out
But I just don't know right now
Because at times you say you love me then you love me not
But you don't hate me if I kick you out my spot
'Cause darlin' lately it seems we've been growin' apart
I don't know how much more I can take this
I feel like sayin' buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh bye
I feel like sayin' buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh bye
But when I look into your eyes, eye, eye, eye, eye, eyes
Just can't do it, do it, do it
Girl when I see your face
It reminds me of the long nights and the good ol' love we made
And now I just can't forget it, mind stuck with it
Don't remember the last time I hit it
Breathe again, I need to breathe again, oh yeah
And when I call ya, the voice mail I get like you've reached Toya
And no, I never wanna leave my name and number
Playin' these childish games, you wanna freeze again
Now I don't need him again
But then you say you love me then you love me not
But you don't hate me if I kick you out my spot
'Cause darlin' lately it seems we've been growin' apart
I don't know how much more I could take this
I feel like sayin' buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh bye
I feel like sayin' buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh bye
But when I look into your eyes, eye, eye, eye, eye, eyes
Just can't do it, do it, do it
Well, then again I probably can
I don't know how longer I can be with you so I guess it's all on you
It's with these mix signals and all it's kind of, kinda hard to tell
You know 'cause one day
You say you love me then you love me not
But you don't hate me if I kick you out my spot
'Cause darlin' lately it seems we've been growin' apart
I don't know how much more I can take this
I feel like sayin' buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh bye
I feel like sayin' buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh bye
But when I look into your eyes, eye, eye, eye, eye, eyes
Just can't do it, do it, do it
