Verse one:
Someone told me to believe
That if I believe, anything could happen
I tried and tried and tried
Nothing ever happened
Some things are impossible
The world is little not enough places for everything
Sometimes in life you just dream
Chorus:
I want to fly
I want everyone to be okay
I want everything like I always wanted
There are so many big dreams in my little world
I want to live
Finally be free
Love everywhere
Why there are so many big dreams in my little world
Verse two:
I believed in everything
I gave my heart on every little thing I did
Who will give me my wings to fly?
Who will give all their hearts for you?
Who will make me free?
Why canÃÂ¢€t I live my life without everyone judging me?
Chorus
Bridge:
IÃÂ¢€ve got my wings; I can fly
Somebody gave everyone all they needed
I am free
I believed
Made it happen
Everything happenedÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
Bridge:
IÃÂ¢€ve got my wings; I can fly
Somebody gave everyone all they needed
I am free
I believed
Made it happen
Everything happenedÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
Woke up realizing it was just a dream
The moment was perfect, I got so happy
So manyÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
So manyÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
So many dreams
Chorus (2):
I want to fly
I want everyone to be equal
I want everything like I always wanted
I want liberty
So many dreams (Oh woah yeah)
Big dreams, big dreams
So many big dreams
In my little world
In my (Just my)
Big dreams (My dreams)
In my little world (My little world)
Big dreams in my little worldÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
