If you like my body touch me
Touch me, touch me, touch me
Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me
Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me
Hey, I like it when you're tellin' me to keep in touch
All over your body, rub it like good luck
Lovers stand up, shawty, keep me doin' too much
Hands where they ought to be, unleash that stuff
And no apology, the freaks don't fuss
Quicksand quality, it's goin' down pretty rough
Brand new wit it, all about that rush
Keep tellin' me to feel it and it's just my luck
I'ma help you make that movie
You know my job 'cause I like my duty
Hit 'em all of the minor groupies
She a dog, I'ma let her meet Snoopy
Round of applause, make it clap like a Uzi
Lemme pause on the cue like Suzy
Set it off to the top with a goof
Lil' mama, it's your call, I hear ya, I heard ya say
Touch me, baby
Touch me all night long
Touch me, baby, yeah
Yeah, I'm into that talk, I'm into that walk
Got a thing for them dollars and it's all my fault
Let my second head tell it, "I'ma break you off"
Yeah, tell 'em I said they got a whole lot of balls
Mr. Go Hard, shawty, if it's that soft
I wanna grab that, have that delivered to the boss
I'ma rump and a jump and a stump with a cause
For that hump automatic hit the window to the wall
Yeah, I wanna get right wit ya already
Hold it down partner, baby, now come on, lady
You invited to the shone party got a fetish
You decided when a grown man with it, baby
All out to the spot like it's on freely
Understand I do it big to the guap heavy
While a mama feelin' hot take her to the telly
I don't like 'em scary like the girls who hit my celli like
Touch me, baby
Touch me all night long
Touch me, baby, yeah
I like you sexy, I want you next to me
Let's leave a legacy, got me feelin' like ecstasy
And a little bit of jealousy, it's all about your melody
Right where I care to be, shawty glad that's definitely a felony
Want me to touch her, that's cool
 I'll spend my paper on you
And pick you up in my coupe
And make it do what it do
Shawty, don't get it confused
You shone and we can get loose
All night I'm breakin' the rules
Go hard, I like when you say
Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me
Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me
Touch me, baby
Touch me all night long
Touch me, baby, yeah
