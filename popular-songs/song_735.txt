Come on man
I need somethin' that I can move to
You better gimme some of that funk
Pulled up, at the red light
Cutie crept up on my left side
Window down, waitin' for my reply
Not a word, I saw it in his eyes
Tell me somethin' good baby
He said, "Whatever you wanna do"
He pulled to the curb, hazards flashed bright
I got out with a catwalk stride
Short skirt, golden brown thighs
Gucci heels, four inch high, he touched my face
Smiled and said, "Whatever you wanna do"
Now I, I said, "I usually need
Some time to get inside"
So I don't know why you
And me feel so right
Maybe we need tonight
We sippin', music on loud
Conversation, your lollipop mouth
You open up, sweet things come out
Whisper to me, "Oh what you talkin' 'bout?"
I said, "I think you know"
He said, "Whatever you wanna do"
You stand up, takin' my breath
It's your song so you do a two-step
I turn away, move my hips slow
Your thoughts, fully exposed
Now we better stop playin'
I said, "Boy, what you gonna do?"
Now I, oh I, usually take
My time to get inside
So I don't know why you
And me feel so right
You and I need tonight
Whatever you want hey, hey
Whatever you want hey, hey
Whatever you want hey, hey
Whatever you want hey, hey
Whatever you want hey, hey
Whatever you want hey, hey
Whatever you want hey, hey
Whatever you want hey, hey
It's all good, yeah, yeah, yeah
Whatever you want to do
Now I normally take
My time to get inside
So I, I don't know why
It feels so right
So maybe we need tonight
Maybe we need, hey, yeah
Whatever you want hey, hey
Whatever you want hey, hey
Whatever you want hey, hey
Whatever you want hey, hey
Whatever you want hey, hey
Whatever you want hey, hey
Whatever you want hey, hey
Whatever you want
