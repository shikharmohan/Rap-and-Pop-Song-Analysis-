That old picture frame keeps hangin' round
'Cause I ain't ready yet to take it down
But every now and then I'll slam the door
Shake it loose and she'll hit the floor
But I can't throw a good thing away
I wish it would break
And I swear my truck's got a haunted radio
'Cause I hear you in every song
But I know what the silence makes me do
So I keep givin' those buttons more abuse
And I wonder how much punchin', it can take
I wish it would break
There I could move on, right on, down the line
Where I don't see you, need you, in my life
But you're wrapped around me
Your memories bound me, like a chain
I wish it would break
And this old heart of mine has got a mind of it's own
And it's decided not to let you go
And even though your love's no longer here
It won't let me shed one tear
'Cause it's still holdin' on to yesterday
I wish it would break
There I could move on, right on, down the line
Where I don't see you, need you, in my life
But you're wrapped around me
Your memories bound me, like a chain
I wish it would break
I wish it would break
Yeah, I wish it would break
Go on and break
