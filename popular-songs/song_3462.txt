We were born in this little town, growin' up
I was countin' down every single day
'Til we made our get-away
But you said you could never see yourself
Tryin' to make a life anywhere else
This would be your home and I was on my own
But ever since you said good-bye
I've been out here on the wind
And baby you would be surprised
All the places you have been
I've seen you in Albuquerque, waitin' out a blizzard
Arizona, dancin' 'cross the desert
Watchin' the sun set in
Girl, I swear just the other day
You were down in Georgia, pickin' them peaches
And Carolina, barefoot on the beaches
No matter where you choose to be
In my heart I'll always see you everywhere
Now a days when I'm passin' through
The conversation always turns to you
And I hear you're doin' fine, livin' out by the county line
Got a man that's home every night
A couple of kids and the kind of life that you want to lead
Guess you could say the same for me
But you and I made our choices all those years ago
Still I know I'll hear your voice
And see you down the road
Maybe in Oklahoma, drivin' 'cross the prairie
In Dallas, Texas isn't that where we always said
We would like to try
But never did so maybe that's why
You're on every highway just beyond the high-beams
Right beside me in all of my sweet dreams
No matter where you choose to be
In my heart I'll always see you
In Albuquerque, waitin' out a blizzard
And Arizona, dancin' 'cross the desert
Watchin' the sun set in Monterey
Girl, I swear just the other day
You were down in Georgia, pickin' them peaches
And Carolina, barefoot on the beaches
No matter where you choose to be
In my heart I'll always see you everywhere
