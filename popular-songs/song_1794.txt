Verse 1:
Said I'd see them later.
Well I guess I lied.
Don't wanna see them ever.
Just gotta let them slide.
It feels kinda strange.
But I just can't handle.
All of this weird change.
Like a never ending strangle.
Seems like it was only.
The other day now.
But they won't leave me.
And I don't know how...
Chorus:
To get them away.
And that's all.
I like it my way.
Cos I hate them all.
Now that I know.
It's easy to fall.
But I need things slow.
Cos I hate them all.
I need more time.
So stop trying to call.
Up I need to climb.
Cos I hate them all.
Verse 2:
I need to leave my home.
It's just too hard.
I'd rather be alone.
Stop sending a card.
I don't want you.
I don't need some love.
This whole things new.
And just too much.
I'd just have to say.
Oh now it's over.
So just go away.
Call me when I'm sober.
Chorus x1
Bridge:
I wouldn't.
They couldn't.
We shouldn't.
No we shouldn't.
Oh don't fall.
Oh don't call.
Hate them all.
Yeah I hate them all!
Chorus x1
Silently:
Don't want to fall.
Cos-I-hate-them-all.
