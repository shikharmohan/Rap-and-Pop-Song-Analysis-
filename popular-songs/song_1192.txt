I used to cry out in the middle of the night
Baby hold me tight
But there was nobody beside me when I opened my eyes
Now I turn the corner of those days and nights
Something inside me changed and I think I might
Be starting over
I don't wanna run
Oh no, cause you might be the one, baby
If ever I could love
I think it could be with you
If ever I thought I found somebody so true
I wonder if you feel
The same way that I do
If ever I could love
I think it could be with you
You know I can't read your mind my love
But it seems to me
That your heart and mine tonight are
Defying gravity
There's something so familiar
And still so unknown
The closer that we get I swear it feels like coming home
And I'm ready to be brave
Oh yea then you look at me and say baby
If ever I could love
I think it could be with you
If ever I thought I found somebody so true
I wonder if you feel
The same way that I do
If ever I could love
I think it could be with you
If ever I could love...baby
If ever I could love
If ever I could love
If ever could be
If ever I could love
Oh yeah no way
If ever I could love
I think it could be with you
If ever I thought I found somebody so true
I Wonder if you feel
The same way that I do
If ever I could love
I think it could be with you
I was scared to love again
Till the day that came
When she walked out of my life
I got hurt so bad
I swear I'd never let another inside this heart of mine
But you touch my hand and every plan that I had
Disappeared like a fallen star
There's a new beginning and I'm moving to the rhythm
Of a beating braver heart
A braver heart
If ever I could love, oh oh
If ever I could love, yea yea
