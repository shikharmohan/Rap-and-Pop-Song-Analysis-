Sometimes, I feel like I've broken down- inside out
I feel like I've been through the worst things in my life
Like everyone has turned against me...
Except for you
Chorus:
You were there for my first soccer game
And you were there when I was called a name
You were there for everythiiing,
except for one (except for one, except for one)
And that one little thing was, Our day (our day)
Ooh, ooh, yeah yeh yeah
Somedays I feel like, you forgot 'bout everything
Feels like my bestest friend has turned her back on me.
YEAH LIKE NO ONE SEES THE REAL, REAL ,REAL ME!
But you
But you
But yoou
Chorus:
You were there for my dance tournament
Oh, you were there for my science experiment  
You were there for everything but oooone!
And that one little tiny thing was, 
Our daaaaay
It was our day to shine
It was our day to find
Our true meaning in the world!
To see 
If we
were truly best friends or nooooot
But I found out, yeah I found out,
we're the bestest friends in the whoooole wiiiide woooorld!
We did everything together
Yeah everything together
Every single thiing,
except for one
