He believes in the family unit
The union of man and wife
He believes that you stand before God
For better, for worse and beyond this life
He believes that a ring on his finger
Is something to be proud of
For all of the world to witness
That he is committed to this love
He wants to get married
And he'll build a house in the country
Where he'll watch his children grow
And teach them the values of something
That most people never even know
He wants to get married
I never thought I would be so blessed
  (I)
To know a man like this
  (Know a man)
He's everything, everything I believed
That a man should be
  (That a man)
And when he is called to his Maker
He wants to go to his grave
With his final remembrance of this earth
To be one last look at his wife's face
He wants to get married
He wants to get married
Oh, he wants to get married
But not to me
