And Fuck A Bus, The Benz Is Parked Like Rosa

She Blamed It On The Al-A-A-Al-A-Alcohol 
She Had Her Hair Did, It Was Bound To Fall 
Down Down For A Damn, Cudi Already Said It 
Her Poker Face Book I'd already read it 
But Man Her Head Was Gooder Than A Music 
Electro Body, Known To Blow Fuses 
A Stripper From The South 
Lookin For A Payday 
Said, Bitch You Should Do It For The Love Like Ray-J 
But They Say You Be On The Conscious Tip 
Get Your Head Right And Get Up On This Conscious Dick 
I Embody Everything From The Godly To The Party 
Its The Way I Was Raised On The Southside Safari 
So
