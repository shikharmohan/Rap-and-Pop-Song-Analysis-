Do me a favor
Tell me what you think about me
Tell me how you want this to be
Go out on a limb and just dream
Paint a picture
Choose your colors extra wise
Especially what you put on my mind
Imagine what it'd be like to touch the sky, yeah, yeah
Whoa, your thoughts are gonna pick me up
Do you know it's good to feel too much?
Oh, you got my head in the clouds
Oh, you got me thinking out loud
The more you dream about me the more that I believe
That nothing's ever out of reach so dream, dream, dream
I breathe your visions
They pull me through the coldest of nights
They steer me towards that moment in time
When you show me what it means for you to be mine, yeah
Whoa, you're giving me the will to try
Do you know that there's happy in these lives?
Oh, you got my head in the clouds
Oh, you got me thinking out loud
The more you dream about me the more that I believe
That nothing's ever out of reach so dream, dream, dream
It's like my birthday every time you look at me
It's like the best thing every time that you dream, yeah, yeah, yeah
Whoa, your thoughts are gonna pick me up
Do you know it's good to feel too much, much?
Oh, you got my head in the clouds
Oh, you got me thinking out loud
The more you dream about me the more that I believe
That nothing's ever out of reach so dream, dream, dream, dream
The more you dream about me the more that I believe
That nothing's ever out of reach so dream, dream, dream, dream
