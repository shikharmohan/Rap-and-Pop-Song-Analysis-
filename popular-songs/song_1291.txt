Hear me, hear me
You gotta be out there
You gotta be somewhere
Wherever you are, I'm waiting
'Cause there are these nights when
I sing myself to sleep
And I'm hoping my dreams
Bring you close to me
Are you listening?
Hear me I'm crying out, I'm ready now
Turn my world upside down, find me
I'm lost inside the crowd, it's getting loud
I need you to see, I'm screaming for you to please
Hear me, hear me
Can you hear me?
Hear me
I used to be scared of
Letting someone in
But it gets so lonely
Being on my own
With no one to talk to
And no one to hold me
I'm not always strong, oh I need you here
Are you listening?
Hear me I'm crying out, I'm ready now
Turn my world upside down, find me
I'm lost inside the crowd, it's getting loud
I need you to see, I'm screaming for you to please
Hear me
I'm restless and wild
I fall but I try
I need someone to understand
Can you hear me?
I'm lost in my thoughts
And baby I've fought
For all that I've got
Can you hear me?
Hear me I'm crying out, I'm ready now
Turn my world upside down, find me
I'm lost inside the crowd, it's getting loud
I need you to see, I'm screaming for you to please
Hear me
Hear me, hear me, hear me
Can you hear me?
Hear me, hear me, hear me
Can you hear me?
Hear me, hear me, hear me
