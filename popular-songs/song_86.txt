There's a live oak tree
You can still see off old 129
You can see the scars, its missing bark
Where it stopped my truck that night
They say I took a swing at my best friend
For trying to take my keys
Next thing I knew I was upside down
Thinking this is it for me
When you see life flash before your eyes
The good, the bad, the wrong, the right
Fade into a bright white light
Shining down on you
You're hanging on by a thread
Wondering which ones your last breath
Knowing there's so much you've left to do
You live your life a better man
When you've been a halfway to Heaven
First thing I did was hug my momma
I even hugged my dad
I told them both how much I love them
Never saw daddy cry like that
Started hanging out with my little brother
Man, I never missed a game
I'm in church every Sunday morning
And I pray every day
When you see life flash before your eyes
The good, the bad, the wrong, the right
Fade into a bright white light
Shining down on you
You're hanging on by a thread
Wondering which ones your last breath
Knowing there's so much you've left to do
You live your life a better man
When you've been halfway to Heaven
And I won't waste one minute
Yeah, my life's changed
And I'm gonna live it
Like I'm hanging on by a thread
Wondering which ones my last breath
Knowing there's so much I've left to do
I live my life a better man, live my life a better man
'Cause I've been halfway to Heaven
Halfway to Heaven
