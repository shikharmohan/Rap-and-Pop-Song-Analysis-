[Chorus]
Man I should've known, should've known, should've known
should've known, should've known
Should've known that she was crazy than a muthafucker
(crazy, crazy, crazy)
she was crazy than a muthafucker
Man I should've known, should've known, should've known
should've known, should've known
Should've known that she was crazy than a muthafucker
(crazy, crazy, crazy)
she was crazy than a muthafucker
[Verse 1]
And God damn you all crazy ass
wanna smash my Mercedes ass
pokin' holes off in the condoms tryna have a baby ass
all up in Saks 5th when you deserve Macy's ass
talkin' bout shit, yea nigga, better pay me ass
bitch all up in my house and I ain't tryna room mate her
she in and out my drawers like its, like it's Room Raiders
she crazy and deranged, when she in the Range
skip the jewelry store and grab rocks
like she Tomb Raider (raider, raider)
but before you hit that Alter
and the preacher start pronouncin'
gave her half your heart but she got half of your amount
of whatever's in your account
so take that into account
and you best get to countin'
before you gets to bouncin'
bitch
[Chorus]
Man I should've known, should've known, should've known
should've known, should've known
Should've known that she was crazy than a muthafucker
(crazy, crazy, crazy)
she was crazy than a muthafucker
Man I should've known, should've known, should've known
should've known, should've known
Should've known that she was crazy than a muthafucker
(crazy, crazy, crazy)
she was crazy than a muthafucker
[Verse 2]
Crazy, man I must be crazy too
cuz crazy as she is I could'nt leave her if ya paid me to
I swear I goes to work on that pussy like she paid me to
d-d-dick her up and now she walkin' like she 82
(I like the you you do it)
she get it from her mama
headaches every night a nigga get it from the drama
man if she don't make that money, she gon' take that money
not from you, yeah she get it from your Honor
believe that, fuck you get my password?
readin' through my emails and you ain't even ask first
I know I should leave her
for damn sure don't, don't need her
everytime I try and hit the door I always hit that ass first
[Chorus]
Man I should've known, should've known, should've known
should've known, should've known
Should've known that she was crazy than a muthafucker
(crazy, crazy, crazy)
she was crazy than a muthafucker
Man I should've known, should've known, should've known
should've known, should've known
Should've known that she was crazy than a muthafucker
(crazy, crazy, crazy)
she was crazy than a muthafucker
