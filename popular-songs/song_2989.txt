(sylvester bradford, al lewis)
You don't remember me
Oh but I remember you
Was not so long ago
You broke my heart in two
Chorus:
Tears on my pillow
Pain in my heart
Caused by you
If we could start anew
I wouldn't hesitate
I'd gladly take you back
And tempt the hand of fate
Repeat chorus
Love is not a gadget
Love is not a toy
When you find the one you love
You fill your heart with joy
Repeat verse #2
Repeat chorus x2
You, you, you...
