They wake up in the mornin' and they drink their coffee black
They love their woman one beat shy of a heart attack
On the way to work they might stop by a fishin' hole
That's how country boys roll
Yeah, they work, work, work all week 'til the job gets done
Weekends they barbecue and have a cold one
They run on a big ol' heart and a pinch of Skoal
That's how country boys roll
Yeah, they're spinnin' their wheels, castin' their reels
Way back on them ol' county roads
Singin' in bars, soupin' their cars
Just to see how fast they'll go
From a ball and a glove to them fallin' in love
They do everythin' heart and soul
That's how country boys roll
Well, if you don't know your way around, they'll draw you a map
And if you're broke and you ask, they'll give you the shirt off their back
All they need is a little gas, a few dollars to fold
That's how country boys roll
Yeah, they're spinnin' their wheels, castin' their reels
Way back on them ol' county roads
Singin' in bars, soupin' their cars
Just to see how fast they'll go
From a ball and a glove to them fallin' in love
They do everythin' heart and soul
That's how country boys roll
Aw, come on now
Yeah, they're cryin' aloud, humble and proud
They love momma and Jesus and Jones
That's how country boys roll, don't you know?
Yeah, that's how country boys roll
