I've been gone for too long
Think it's time I bring it back
I've been gone for too long
Now it's time I take it back, back
Yeah, Yeah you like it when I move it to the beat like that
Got that bump bump in your trunk
Got them speakers burnin' up
Gimme that bass
Gimme Gimme Gimme Gimme that bass, that bass (4x)
Gimme that bass
Gimme Gimme Gimme Gimme that bass (4x)
This right here's a banger
This right here's a keeper 
Just know when you play this
You might blow out your speakers
Me, I'm TNT (boom)
Please don't set me off
When this song come on
You know I'm goin' off
I'm from the Peace up, "A" down
Imma bring the place down
This Georgia peach is so round
Like it when I drop, drop down to the ground
I'm from the Peace up, "A" down
Never complain when I put it down
Your princess is back in town
I'm finna put on my crown
I've been gone for too long
Think it's time I bring it back
I've been gone for too long
Now it's time I take it back, back
Yeah, Yeah you like it when I move it to the beat like that
Got that bump bump in your trunk
Got them speakers burnin' up
Gimme that bass
Gimme Gimme Gimme Gimme that bass, that bass (4x)
Gimme that bass

Never complain when I put it down
Your princess is back in town
