Ain't nothin' out here but me, road and the radio
Lookin' for an exit and the song that I might know
Countin' down the memories and addin' up the miles
Searchin' for a feelin' I ain't felt in a while
Clarity and inspiration, happiness is a destination
That's hard to find and may take some time
In my mind there's something more
And I'll open up a brand new door
And find the strength to close the ones I left behind
And I'll get there leanin' on some friends I know
The road and the radio
Spent the night in Carolina, got up early out of bed
Bought a Red Bull and a road map and an old 'Stones' cassette
Settin' my sight south bound, no reason or right
Through up a prayer just lookin', just lookin' for a sign in some
Clarity and inspiration, happiness is a destination
That's hard to find and may take some time
But in my mind there's something more
And I'll open up a brand new door
And find the strength to close the ones I left behind
And I'll get there leanin' on some friends I know
The road and the radio
In my mind there's something more
And I'll open up a brand new door
And find the strength to close the ones I left behind
And I'll get there leanin' on some friends I know
The road and the radio
The road and the radio
The road and the radio
Hmm, the road and the radio
The road and the radio, hmm
