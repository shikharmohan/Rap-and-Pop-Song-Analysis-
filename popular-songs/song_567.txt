I hit the weed I told myself the last time would be my last
I don't trust my own n-ggas now my mind racing fast
got my foot up on the gas, got a hundred on the dash
if the police run up on me I aint stopping for their ass
boy you know my L's dirty if they stop me I'm goin to jail surely
I'll be next to my brother in the cell no bail for me
man let me out send me back to bitches that smell Purdy (pretty)
and all I gotta do is call once and she'll be all ready
yeah buddy cant you tell im goin thru hell
I don't even open my mail
I'm in the shower with soap on the towel
I need cleansing
bad bitches all on the prowl they need Benzes
p-ssy n-ggas running they mouth but we aint flinching
the names that need mention(?)
I got dreams bigger then your whole team
you n-ggas so broke yet somehow you so cream
I guess this indie started with a penny now I'm getting plenty money
one time for the city, yea
two times for...
hey
and one time for the city, hey
a two times for the...
hey
