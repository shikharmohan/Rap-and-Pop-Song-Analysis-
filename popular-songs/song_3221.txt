Welcome to misery punk!
We deep rooted in this yerm saying? 
KC M.O. , KCK yerm saying thats how we do it 
Tech N9ne in this piece, Strange music represent!
Welcome to misery where the killers pop it off
And when I say pop it off I mean daily with the tongue and the gun
We can do it if anybody want it
Where the rapper niggas are clappin up another, tell everyone
Misery loves company so we done with thee
Enemy, where he be? energy sendin me the route
I'm negativity, trippin with me you runnin for ya life
cos you ran your MOUTH! (MOUTH)
CHORUS:
[We can sang or we can bang
It aint no game we untamed
Whether its fame or we can aim
Release your brains it aint no thang
MIDWEST CHOPPERS

And it's a shame that you, came and got drained
And listen mane stay in yo lane]]]
MIDWEST CHOPPERS
Finna witness tha murderers monologue of a menace comin from out of a sinister formidable place

So On the way to the studio we be makin another hot track
They be lovin the way that we spit it when we drop
They call me D-loc im the fortunate
definition of a soulja

And we flow like with the mo like

Hands down now I popped ya now
Lets take a trip to the back of your real gear
Strange the individual wit ill skill

When you get out of the truck spittin off the crane

Hit you with the lyrical lyrical miracle whip incredible knock the head like a several
Diggy diggy down diggy down watcha diggy down  cook it clown and at the house hold it down diggy diggy_____ diggy down
And if you look for the sound you can be found with the nigga in the crowd are you really wit me?
And when you hear it then nigga then zip it
These make you want to reposition and pivit
When we write it and spit it we makin somebody get it
And if they wont hear it then they wont get it
STOP
Oh we can keep babblin on
Or rapplin off at the mouth while we travelin
And we speakin on on the speakin on the things we be doin comin in to pop my mouth
And where the hell were u?
And I can stop with the drop
With the Caribou
And they see me pop I would say was you
And I wont hesitate to chop you
Until to you
While they doin you
And if you look at the better at the better to combust you got the Cali gun for fun
And if you throw me past the pack man you get it
