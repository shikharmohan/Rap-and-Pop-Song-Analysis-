Everything's cool, yeah
It's all gonna be okay, yeah
And I know maybe I'll even laugh about it someday
But not today, no
'Cause I don't feel so good
I'm tangled up inside
My heart is on my sleeve
Tomorrow is a mystery to me
And it might be wonderful
It might be magical
It might be everything I've waited for
A miracle
Oh, but even if I fall in love again
With someone new
It can never be the way
I loved you
Letting you go is
Making me feel so cold, yeah
And I've been trying to make-believe it doesn't hurt
But that makes it worse, yeah
See, I'm a wreck inside
My tongue is tied
And my whole body feels so weak
The future may be all I really need
And it might be wonderful
It might be magical
It might be everything I've waited for
A miracle
Oh, but even if I fall in love again
With someone new
It can never be the way I loved you
Like a first love
My one and only true love
Was it written all over my face?
Yeah, I loved you like you loved me
Like something pure and holy
Like something that can never be replaced
And it was wonderful
It was magical
It was everything I've waited for
A miracle
And if I should ever fall in love again
With someone new
Oh, it could never be the way
No, it will never be the way
I loved you
