(Mike Ward / Dierks Bentley)
They come from Kentucky, Mississippi and Alabam
Way down in Texas from all over this land
Each one has a dream and a thousand different goals
But the one that they all share is that midnight radio
Chorus
They're gonna be big stars in big cars and wear nudie suits
Featured on the Opry in rhinestone boots
They'll be ridin on a rainbow to a wall hung with gold
Hillbilly dreams on the midnight radio
Hillbilly dreams on the midnight radio
It started with a fiddler, then banjo and guitar
And Roy Acuff was its first singing star
Hank and Minnie and Mr. Monroe
We all sang with them through that radio
Chorus
We were big stars in big cars and wearin nudie suits
Featured on the Opry in rhinestone boots
We were riding on a rainbow to a wall hung with gold
Hillbilly dreams on the midnight radio
Hillbilly dreams on the midnight radio
This world keeps on changing for the better they say
But the more we move ahead the more I miss the old ways
Hey I don't mind the modern and as far as I can see
I'll keep trying to make the future part of history
Chorus
And be a big star in a big car and wearin nudie suits
Featured on the Opry in rhinestone boots
I'll be riding on a rainbow to a wall hung with gold
Hillbilly dreams on the midnight radio
Hillbilly dreams on the midnight radio
Hillbilly dreams on the midnight radio
Hillbilly dreams on the midnight radio
