Silent night
Holy night
All is calm
All is bright
Round young virgin
Mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night
Holy night
Shepard's praying
At the sight
Glory stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hole sang Hallelujah
Christ the savor is born
Christ the savor is born
Silent night
Holy night
Shout out God
Loves pure light
Rage of beings from the holy face
With the dawn of amazing grace
Jesus, Lord at the verge
Jesus, Lord at the verge
