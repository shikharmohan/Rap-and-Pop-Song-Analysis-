There's some things that I regret
Some words I wish had gone unsaid
Some starts that had some better endings
Been some bad times I've been through
Damage I cannot undo
Some things, I wish I could do all all over again
But it don't really matter, life gets that much harder
It makes you that much stronger
Oh, some pages turned, some bridges burned
But there were lessons learned
Every tear that had to fall from my eyes
Everyday I wonder how I get through the night
Every change, life has thrown me
I'm thankful, for every break in my heart, I'm grateful, for every time
Some pages turned, some bridges burned
But there were lessons learned
There's mistakes that I have made
Some chances I just threw away
Some roads, I never should've taken
Been some signs I shouldn't see
Hearts that I hurt needlessly
Some roads that I wish I could have one more chance to make
But it don't make no difference
The past can't be rewritten, you get the life you're given
Oh, some pages turned, some bridges burned
But there were lessons learned
And every tear that had to fall from my eyes
Everyday I wonder how I get through the night
Every change, life has thrown me
I'm thankful, for every break in my heart, I'm grateful, for every time
Some pages turned, some bridges burned
But there were lessons learned
And all the things that break you, all the things that make you strong
You can't change the past, 'cause it's gone
And nothing's gotta go, because they are gone
Lessons learned
Every tear that had to fall from my eyes
From everyday I wonder how I get through the night
From every change, life has thrown me
I'm thankful, for every break in my heart, I'm grateful, for every time
Some pages turned, some bridges burned
But there were lessons learned
Oh, some pages turned, some bridges burned
But there were lessons learned, lessons learned
