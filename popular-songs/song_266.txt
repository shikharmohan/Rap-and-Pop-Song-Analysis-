(Ladies and gentlemen)
Pay attention
Ciara's what the game been missin'

And now I don't play no ball, I just ball
Dranks for all y'all Gin gale in it
Put ya cups up, Zin Zale sent it
You may look at me and think that
I'm just a young girl but I'm not just a young girl
Baby this is what I'm lookin' for sexy, independent
Down to spend it type that's gettin' his dough
I'm not bein' too dramatic, that's the way I gotta have it
I bet you want the goodies, bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered, maybe 'cuz I talk about it
Lookin' for the goodies, keep on lookin' 'cuz they stay in the jar
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Just because you drive a Benz, I'm not goin' home wit you
You won't get no nookie or the cookies, I'm no rookie
And still I'm sexy, independent, I ain't wit it so you already know
I'm not bein' too dramatic, that's the way I gotta have it
You may feel slick, tryna hit but I'm not dumb
I'm not bein' too dramatic, it's just how I gotta have it
I bet you want the goodies, bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered, maybe 'cuz I talk about it
Lookin' for the goodies, keep on lookin' 'cuz they stay in the jar
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
You way too hot to keep ya goodies on lock
I don't need a locksmith, I got the key to that box
I wanna see you next to me in that drop
Us chillin' in Tahiti no shoes, no socks
Maybe in Jamaica poppin' bottles on the yacht
Then back in Miami grand hustle no stop
Give it to me 'cuz you wanna, I ain't workin' for it
You can keep ya nigga look at me, look at me
(You think I'm payin' for it?)
You're insuating that, I'm hot but these goodies boy are not
Just for any of the many men that's tryna get on top
No you can't call me Layta and I don't want your numba
I'm not changin' stories, just respect the play I'm callin'
I bet you want the goodies, bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered, maybe 'cuz I talk about it
Lookin' for the goodies, keep on lookin' 'cuz they stay in the jar
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
I bet you want the goodies, bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered, maybe 'cuz I talk about it
Lookin' for the goodies, keep on lookin' 'cuz they stay in the jar
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
