Ladies 
Welcome to the gentleman's lair
Understand that what happens here 
Stays here
So with that being said
Inhibition off
[Verse 1]
Close your eyes
If you're feeling bad
But there are things
That I'm gonna do to you
Sexy things
Amazing things
That you're gonna need to see
To believe are true
Hypnotized 
Not in here baby
But your state of mind will be altered
Paradise is my body girl
And we're gonna go there
Cuz you wanna go there
[Chorus]
Girl have you ever
Had someone take the time
To sex your body
But also sex your mind
Telekinesis 
Baby let me touch you without touching you
Telekinesis 
Baby let me touch you without touching you
[Verse 2]
Take this ride
On a fantasy
Fairytale
I'll be your guide
I'll get you there
So divine in that pretty dress
Let me take you out of it
I'm just thinking about it
I can fly 
Come with me baby
To the sky of satisfaction
Paradise is my body
And we're gonna go there
Cuz you wanna go there
[Chorus]
Girl have you ever
Had someone take the time
To sex your body
But also sex your mind
Telekinesis 
Baby let me touch you without touching you
Telekinesis 
Baby let me touch you without touching you
[Verse 3]
Let me touch you without touching you
Let me touch you without touching you
Baby let me touch you without touching you
[Chorus x2]
Girl have you ever
Had someone take the time
To sex your body
But also sex your mind
Telekinesis 
Baby let me touch you without touching you
Telekinesis 
Baby let me touch you without touching you
Girl have you ever
Had someone take the time
To sex your body
But also sex your mind
Telekinesis 
Baby let me touch you without touching you
Telekinesis 
Baby let me touch you without touching you
