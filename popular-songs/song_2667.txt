Thousands of people live in this town
And I had to run into him
When I saw him there on that busy street
Those feelings came back again
There was nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
He walked up to me, looked in my eyes
And still the world stood still
I couldn't move and all I could feel
Was this aching in my heart
Saying I loved him still
He said, "How have you been?
It's great to see you again
You're really a sight for sore eyes"
I said, "I can't complain, I'm doing fine"
We talked as the people rushed by
We laughed about old times and all we went through
That's when he hugged me and said, "I've missed you"
And still the world stood still
I couldn't move and all I could feel
Was this aching in my heart
Saying I loved him still
That's when she walked up to him he said, "This is my wife"
I gave my best smile but I was dying inside
He said, "We gotta go now it's getting late"
It was so good to see you and then they walked away
And still my world stood still
I couldn't move and all I could feel
Was this aching in my heart
Saying I loved him still
