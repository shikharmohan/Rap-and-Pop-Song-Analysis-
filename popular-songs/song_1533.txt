We went out last night
Like we swore we wouldn't do
Drank too much beer last night
A lot more than we wanted to
There were girls from Argentina and Arkansas
Maine, Alabama and Panama
All mixed together and having a ball
Yeah, we went went out last night
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Hitting on everybody and their mother
There were two karaoke girls drunk on a dare
Singing "I Got You Babe" by Sonny and Cher
Yeah, life was good everywhere
We went out last night
Well you know I'm a music man
I grew up in east Tennessee
Well last night I was everything
When I got a few drinks in me
I was a doctor, a lawyer, a senator's son
Brad Pitt's brother and a man on the run
Anything I thought would get the job done
Yeah, we went out last night
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Hitting on everybody and their mother
There were people doing body shots up on the bar
Jimmy in a fist fight out by the car
Everybody was some kind of star
When we went out last night
Well the fact that I'm still breathing
Means that I must have survived
And that I lived to go out with my friends again tonight
Oh, we went out last night
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Everybody started loving on each other
They were dancing on the tables and howling at the moon
Pairing up together and pretty soon
There was not a soul in sight
When we went out last night
