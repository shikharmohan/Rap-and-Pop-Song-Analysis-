I've loved you since the very first day
When I caught you looking my way
Smiled, and I just knew it
And up until you came along
And no one ever heard my song
Now it's clowning with a bullet
It's nice to have someone so honestly devoted
But when it's said and done
Girl, I hope you know that
The traveling, the singing, it don't mean nothing without you
The fast cars, the guitars, they are all just second to
This life, this love that you and I have been dreaming of for so long
Would all be as gone without you, without you
Along comes a baby girl
And suddenly my little world
Just got a whole lot bigger
Yes it did
And people who I barely knew
Who loved me 'cause I'm part of you
Man, it's tough to figure
How two souls could be
Miles from one another
But still you and me
Have somehow found each other
The traveling, the singing, it don't mean nothing without you
The fast cars, the guitars, they are all just second to
This life, this love that you and I have been dreaming of for so long
Would all be as gone without you, without you
Without you I'd survive
But I'd have to have the notion
That I could live this life
Just going through the motions
The traveling, the singing, it don't mean nothing without you
The fast cars, the guitars, they are all just second to
This life, this love that you and I have been building up so high
It's never going to touch the sky without you, without you, without you
Baby, baby, baby
Without you
Without you
