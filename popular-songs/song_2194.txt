One more day to complete my service
One more high to decay my nervous
Wondering how I'm gonna find, it's over
One more day to complete my service
One more time here to fade my servant
One more day gonna find a way, over
She seen through me and mine
And I know a later time
We could make it with you
We are the same
Old age, old age, old age, old age
One more day to complain, my servant
One more doubt here to find a servant
One more doubt I'm gonna find a way, and it's over
Wondering how I'm here date my cover
One more doubt here to save my never
Wondering how I'm gonna find a way, it's over
She seemed true me and mine
And I know a later time
We and we're you to you
Leave the soul
Old age, old age, old age, old age
Just you need and read you free
And knew you read you flew
One more day to complete my circuit
One more high here to find my nervous
Someday I'm gonna find a way, it's over
One more doubt here to claim my supper
I can have anything you wanted
Wondering how I'm gonna find a way, it's over
He seemed to read minds and I know we're out of time
Breathe away here with you dream the same on the dew
Breathe the same on her breathe to moan on a man
Breathe and shame on you, he's late
Old age, old age, old age, old age
Old age, old age, old age
