You don't know what you're doin'
What you doin' to me
Try to stop me, can't stop me
Cos you know what I need
You got me all open and now you tryin to leave
Hold It, Don't Drop It (Don't Drop It)
Stop it, (can't stop it, won't stop it)
Every time I try to run, something keeps stopping me (stopping me)
I try my best to turn around, but your touch won't let me leave
I can't control it, you put something inside of me
Cos you're a problem
Boy you must a __ me
You don't know what you're doin'
What you doin' to me
Try to stop me, can't stop me
Cos you know what I need
You got me all open and now you tryin to leave
Hold It, Don't Drop It
Don't Drop It
Stop it, can't stop it
won't stop it
You don't know what you're doin'
What you doin' to me
Try to stop me, can't stop me
Cos you know what I need
You got me all open and now you tryin to leave
Hold It, Don't Drop It
Don't Drop It
Stop it, can't stop it
won't stop it
