Saw a man in the movies that didn't have a heart
How I wish I could give him mine
Then I wouldn't have to feel, it breaking all apart
And this emptiness inside would suit me fine
It's times like these, I wish I were the Tin Man
You could hurt me all you wanted and I'd never even know
I'd give anything just to be the Tin Man
And I wouldn't have a heart and I wouldn't need a soul
I couldn't see your leavin', comin' you took me by surprise
Even now it still seems like a dream
But I know I can't be dreamin' 'cause as I lay down each night
The pain so great that it won't let me sleep
It's times like these, I wish I were the Tin Man
You could hurt me all you wanted and I'd never even know
I'd give anything just to be the Tin Man
And I wouldn't have a heart and I wouldn't need a soul
Well I'd give anything just to be the Tin Man
And I wouldn't have a heart and I wouldn't miss you so
