Man, I'm fresh as hell in this hoodie
Uh, yeah, uh, uh, let's get it
Oh, Omarion, yeah, uh, yeah
With my hoodie on
With my hoodie on
With my hoodie on
See the money, see the cars, see the house, livin' large
Look in the mirror, see a star, I'm outta space, hella far
They at the bottom, I'm on top, I'm so high, I can't drop
And you can find me in your city steezed out with my hoodie
I go, I go, I go so hard
I got my 501 jeans on with my hoodie on
All white V-Neck clean with my hoodie on
Fresh out the box so boast with my hoodie on
I drop my steez on with my hoodie on
I'm gettin' money all day, every day with my hoodie on
Baby, lookin' good over there with the hoodie on
Hustlers, gangstas, bustas, ridas
They goin' out with they hoodie on
You see the fade bright lights
You see my chick, you see my eyes
I hit the stage, I kill the mic
Get em' on the floor, we gettin' right
Nigga, I'm a vet, give it up
I get respect, Cali love
And you can find me in your city
Steezed out with my hoodie
I go, I go, I go so hard
I got my 501 jeans on with my hoodie on
All white V-Neck clean with my hoodie on
Fresh out the box so boast with my hoodie on
I drop my steez on with my hoodie on
I'm gettin' money all day, every day with my hoodie on
Baby, lookin' good over there with the hoodie on
Hustlers, gangstas, bustas, ridas
They goin' out with they hoodie on
I get money all day, every day with my hoodie on
Strong on the rap game, know I get my bully on
And I stay strapped, boy, you know I keep my fully on
Hustle like I'm broke even though a nigga fully on
Aw, ya'll be doin' too much, this is 2010
We don't do button ups, this incredible fashion
This incredible fabric, got my Levi's saggin'
Got my L Coat draggin'
Aw, comin' down on you hoes
Comin' down like I'm Hova
I had to rock on the stove
I smoke a rock when I roll
You know that presidential, pass it to O
He like, "Oh no, I'm high off life my nigga"
I'm like, "Alright, my nigga"
I guess that's more for me, chronic with no seeds
Like no ovaries, you dig it
But if you don't then who cares?
I got my hood on my arm and hoodie over my head
I got my 501 jeans on with my hoodie on
All white V-Neck clean with my hoodie on
Fresh out the box so boast with my hoodie on
I drop my steez on with my hoodie on
I'm gettin' money all day, every day with my hoodie on
Baby, lookin' good over there with the hoodie on
Hustlers, gangstas, bustas, ridas
They goin' out with they hoodie on
Man, I hope they don't think I'ma rob em' with this hoodie on
Yeah dog, I got stopped by the cops for wearin' a hoodie
Well, this 'BB The Jerk' ProPheT
Yeah, Starworld, you already know, aye, we home
