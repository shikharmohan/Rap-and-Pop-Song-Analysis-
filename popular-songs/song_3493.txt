Spent forty-eight dollars last night at the county fair
I throwed out my shoulder but I won her that teddy bear
She's got me saying sugar-pie, honey, darlin' and dear
I ain't seen the Braves play a game all year
I'm gonna get fired, if I don't get some sleep
My long lost buddies say I'm gettin' in too deep
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
My mama and daddy tried to teach me courtesy
But it never sank in till that girl got a hold of me
Now I'm holding umbrellas and openin' up doors
I'm taking out the trash and I'm sweepin' my floors
Crossin' my fingers and countin' every kiss
Prayin' that it keeps goin' on like this
'Cause I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
Got to wash my truck and dress up
To pick her up to watch TV
And she sits down on the sofa, she'll move a little closer
She can't get enough of me
And I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
Come on, baby
You know what I like
Yeah, I like that
Hey don't forget to turn out the lights
