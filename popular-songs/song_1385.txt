Last night, downtown I was drinking the booze
Like it was going out if style
My whole head got light, I lost my eyesight
I ain't been that drunk in awhile
Along about one I spotted a queen and I started to make my move
Ah, she was believing every line I was laying
Lord I was just too cool
Well, I thought I had died and gone to heaven
But Lord did I look like a fool
Last night I came in at two with a ten
But at ten I woke up with a two
Last night I came in at two with a ten
But at ten I woke up with a two
I got twenty-twenty vision when I ain't drinking
But Lord, when I get on that booze!
I ain't never gone to bed with an uglier woman
But I sure woke up with a few
Last night I came in at two with a ten
But at ten I woke up with a two
Hell, I made up my mind
I was never gonna find myself in that condition again
Here I sit on the same barstool
And just look at the shape I'm in
I done spotted me another queen sitting at a table alone
So I strolled on over and sat myself down
And asked if I could take her home
When she said yes, I thought I'd been blessed
But boy did I look like a fool
Last night I came in at two with a ten
But at ten I woke up with a two
Last night I came in at two with a ten
But at ten I woke up with a two
I got twenty-twenty vision when I ain't drinking
But Lord when I get on that booze!
I ain't never gone to bed with an uglier woman
But I sure woke up with a few
Last night I came in at two with a ten
But at ten I woke up with a two
Now you may laugh but if you've got the cash
I'll bet you ten to one you have too
