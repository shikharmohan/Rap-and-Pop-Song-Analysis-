"I walked in there," said Slim
Cleaning up his memory with some sapphire gin
Mr. Paine grabbed my arm, pulled me aside
And said, "Kid, are you ready for the wild ride"
I looked up, there she stood, I said
"If you didn't look so great, I'd say you look good"
Oh, she took her hand, ran it up my thigh
And said, "Cowboy you ready for the wild ride"
Come on now, junior, take a wild ride
See can you make it on the wild ride
Don't try no shakin' on the wild ride
'Cause things start breakin' on the wild ride
Out on the highway, I saw my mind
In tiny little pieces thrown from side to side, yeah
My heart was shattered along with my pride
Guess you can't keep 'em on the wild ride
Come on now, junior, take a wild ride
See can you make it on the wild ride
Don't try no shakin' on the wild ride
'Cause things start breakin' on the wild ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
Crawlin' 'cross the floor, yeah, trying to leave, yeah
Felt something tuggin' what was left of my sleeve
I heard a little voice with a gold-plated vibe
Say, "I bought a ticket for the wild ride"
Come on now, junior, take the wild ride
See can we make it on the wild ride
Don't try to shake it on the wild ride
'Cause things start breakin' on the wild ride
Yeah, could you take me on the wild ride?
See can you meet me on the wild ride
Hey baby, shake me on the wild ride
Think you might break me on the wild ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
Wild ride
Wild ride
Wild ride
