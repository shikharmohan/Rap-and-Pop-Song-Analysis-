I can't sleep, ain't no sleep a' comin' I'm just lying here thinkin' bout you
I'm in deep, fallin' deep into the picture
In my mind of everything we're gonna do
Over at the lake and down by the river you can feel it start to rise
Wanna jump in my car go wherever you are cause I need you by my side
It's gonna be a long hot summer, we should be together
With your feet up on the dashboard now
Singin' along with the radio, it's such a beautiful sound
When you say my name in the middle of the day I swear I see the stars come out
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind
Just waiting on the sun to go down, the sun to go down
I wanna see your brown skin shimmer in the sun for the first time
I try to be the one who knows just what to do to you to get me that smile
One chance of meeting, you walking by me on the street and I said "hi"
And that was the beginning of my heart spinnin' like these wheels in my head tonight
It's gonna be a long hot summer, we should together
With your feet up on the dashboard now
Singin' along with the radio, it's such a beautiful sound
When you say my name in the middle of the day I swear I see the stars come out
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind
Just waiting on the sun to go down, the sun to go down
The only place that I wanna be is where you are
Cause any more than a heartbeat away is just too far, oh
It's gonna be a long hot summer, we should be together
All I really want is more than this moment right now
Cause when you say my name in the middle of the day I swear I see the stars come out
And when you hold my hand and I look into your eyes
I swear it looks like you're waiting on the sun to go down, the sun to go down
Oh, I swear it looks like you're waiting on the sun to go down, waiting on the sun to go down
Oh, I'm lovin' thinking bout you
I can't sleep, I'm just lying here thinkin' bout you
