Seems like street lights glowing
Happened to be just like moments passing in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See, I know my destination but I'm just not there
All the street lights glowing
Happened to be just like moments passing in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See, I know my destination but I'm just not there
In the streets, in the streets
I'm just not there in the streets
I'm just not there
Life's just not fair
Seems like street lights glowing
Happened to be just like moments passing in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See, I know my destination but I'm just not there
All the street lights glowing
Happened to be just like moments passing in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See, I know my destination but I'm just not there
All the street lights glowing
Happened to be just like moments passing in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See, I know my destination but I'm just not there
In the streets, in the streets
I'm just not there in the streets
I'm just not there
Life's just not fair, life's just not fair
