When I'm single it don't really matter who it is, no
Or how many I decide to kick it with, no
Long as she can understand how I do it
I'm a man with a very healthy appetite for chicks
But when I settle down find a women to live for, yeah
Still may be a couple cuties at my door, yeah
Later we could get down like we did before
And get mad when I tell her it can't be like that no more
Girl, you know I got a girl
I just don't get down like that
I don't get down like that
Baby you're fine, baby you's a dime
But I just don't get down like that
I don't get down like that
Understand baby girl I'm a totally new man
I don't live to crush as many as I can, no more
Found a girl that changed my whole game plan
She's the one, she's the one only one that I'm gon' tend
And I know girl I know that you really want me bad
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't tempted
All the things we used to do I kinda miss it
It ain't nothing you can give as good as this is, girl
Girl, you know I got a girl
I just don't get down like that
I don't get down like that
Baby you're fine, baby you's a dime
But I just don't get down like that
I don't get down like that, baby
Baby all I can say is I'm sorry
Since I found me my lady
To think about cheating would be crazy
I don't get down baby
Baby, all I can say is I'm sorry
Since I found me my lady
To think about cheating would be crazy
And I don't get down, baby
Girl, you know I got a girl
I just don't get down like that
I don't get down like that
Baby you're fine, baby you's a dime
But I just don't get down like that
I don't get down like that
You know I got a girl
I just don't get down like that
I don't get down like that
Baby you're fine, baby you's a dime
But I just don't get down like that
I don't get down like that
Baby, I just don't get down like that
I don't get down like that
Baby you're fine, baby you's a dime
