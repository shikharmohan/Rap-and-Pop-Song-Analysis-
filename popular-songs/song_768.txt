Baby let your hair down, let me set the moon right
blend in with the stars underneath the moon light
we can take it far , farther than we've ever gone
(ooooh babe)
There must be a magnet 
cause physical attraction , runs through our things love 
makings ever lasting
Lights and the cameras . were never out of action
(nooooo)
(CHORUS)
Everytime we make loveeee 
all night 
all night , all 
when we make loveee
all night , all night 
with you. . 
is it just my imagination spinning through my head?
sipping champagne  , rose peddles on the bed
teach each other lessons , over and again
like baby when we kiss (feels just like heaven)
when we touch (i just got to hold you in my arms )
gotta keep you up until its all gone
(CHORUS)
Everytime we make loveeee 
all night 
all night , all 
when were about to make loveee
all night , all night 
with you. . 
(x6)
La la la la love
 ill give it to you from my heart
Cause you got the kind of love one wishes upon a star
dont tell me to gooo , cause i wont stop.
until the morning comes 
raise the sun 
yeaaaah thats when you know 
we made loveee all night
all night
all yeah were about to make love 
all night
all night 
with youuuuu .
(x6)
La la la la love
