I just kissed you goodbye a half an hour ago
I know you've drivin' to the airport but I just gotta pick up the phone
And hear you one more time saying my name
I must be going outta my mind
Why's it feel so long since you've been gone?
Why's it feel so long?
Oh, time keeps dragging on 'til you get back home
Why's it feel so long? Babyness
'Cause I miss you babe
I've never loved anyone like I love you
So when you're not around I must confess I lose myself
And I don't know who or where I am
I might be crazy, crazy about being your man
Why's it feel so long since you've been gone?
Why's it feel so long?
Time keeps dragging on 'til you get back home
Why's it feel so long?
When I finally see you I know it'd be like you never left at all
But there's no consolation tonight isn't waiting
Praying maybe you'll call, call me, call me baby
Tell me now why's it feel so long since you've been gone?
Why's it feel so long?
Time keeps dragging on 'til you get back home
Why's it feel so long?
Why's it feel so long since you've been gone?
Why's it feel so long?
Time just crawls along 'til you get back home
Why's it feel so long?
I look in my watch, I stare at the clock
They don't move, I don't either, I'm just frozen on the couch
So the seconds feel like hours and hours like a day
It's a twilight zone in this home when you go away
Please don't go away
