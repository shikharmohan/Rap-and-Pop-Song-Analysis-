To all the girls that I loved before
I only wanna love ya more
I know it sounds shady, lady
[chorus:]
Girl crazy
I know nobody can save me,
From spreadin my crazy love
I'm dippin out with your lady,
To give her some crazy love
Ain't trynna have no more babies
So come for my crazy love
Enough to make her go crazy
Cuz I'm all about crazy love
I was born Aaron Dantes Yates
Now This song for Aaron Dantes mates, wait
IF you ever been with me
Had some sex or even kissed me,
Spend some years with me or even a quickie, trip thee
Way I handle the beast In me the peace in me and equally I chief to say the least women are weaker then me
Since I was a little fella, witta me a female-a issabella,
What the hell not 1 but its more like12 let me tell ya
Hella Bitches love me once then love me again,
While ya lovin me I'm lovin your friend, ya'll just lovin the sin,
And all that tech time you lovin to spend, but I ain't tryna be no husband again
Look at all this mug that I'm in,
And all this dirt that I do and this hurt put on you its true
Worse them pepe la pue what it do
To my ladies I remember the message I sent to ya I know ya think I'm a friend to ya but I'm tryna put it up into ya
[chorus]
A challenge a ghetto my uncle explained it to me, What
Kick it with bitches the picture that he painted for me
Now that I'm a G I'm bout to go in to depth got low when I crept
What a bitch you niggaz ain't no when I slept (with who)
Sanya Tanya Vanya big booty Sandra Wanda Landa Ronda Manya V-neck and Anya
Ain't just to fill the pound between us
Kiss the crown of my wiener
Once you lay down then you're stuck with the killer clown the Nina
Witness my sickness this itches for the bitches with the quickness
Kisses for misses is cliquish suspicious that I hit this
What they really don't know I had the most ludacris fling with this girl
I think the female is really the most beatifulest thing in this world
They take off their shirt take off their bra
Then let you take off their skirt and panties keep a nigger in awe
In between im such a freedom is lovin monster sex
For them to let you inside them is a fucken compliment
[chorus]
The Homie for true he's sick
Cuz he choose these chicks
On the road I let them Sud mi pik
They telling me I show my wife no fidelity and lost it
Literally my way with women has cost it considerably
Bitter is he who loved then lost with the grudge and cross the moss
In the land where the word lost is boss
So we quest for love and flings with the finest the life can bring to ya
True you two have a thing but ill never ever be singular
Guess you can say it's the angel in me
That got these bitches havin dreams of mangling me
(I know it hurt and sucks for women when they let me thrust within them )
Why do they lay with the snake
(but cant there stop there lust for venom
But you will not forgive me baby you gots to admit we crazy)
Cuz you bring me your light and im just so ditz and hazy
My heart is massive but they want my dick
Bitch you aint never felt no shit like this so give me a kiss
[chorus]
Ooo way ya oo way ya heeeeyy ya
Ooo way ya oo way ya heey way ya
