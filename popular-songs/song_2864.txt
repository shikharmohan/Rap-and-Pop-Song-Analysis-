She came in lookin' good and lookin' around
She's checkin' out every man in the room right now
Don't go tellin' her about right or wrong
She's been alone an' way too long
Oh, the heart is a lonely hunter
With only one desire
To find some lastin' comfort
In the arms of a lover's fire
Driven by a desperate hunger
To the dark of the neon light
Oh, the heart is a lonely hunter
When there's no sign of love in sight
She hears him say "Hey, can I buy you a drink?"
And sees the pale white circle where he wears his ring
She knows he's dealin' her a dangerous hand
The consequences of a one night stand
But, the heart is a lonely hunter
With only one desire
To find some lasting comfort
In the arms of a lover's fire
Driven by a desperate hunger
To the dark of the neon light
Oh, the heart is a lonely hunter
When there's no sign of love in sight
From somewhere deep inside, she tells him no, woh
Before she starts to cry, she turns to go
Oh, the heart is a lonely hunter
With only one desire
To find some lasting comfort
In the arms of a lover's fire
Driven by a desperate hunger
To the dark of the neon light
Oh, the heart is a lonely hunter
When there's no sign of love in sight
Oh, the heart is a lonely hunter
When there's no sign of love in sight
