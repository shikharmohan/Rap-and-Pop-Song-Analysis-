What happened to the man who used to take me
straight into misery
I want you back and now I must admit it shames me
How could this be?
Tell me what's this desperation
'Cuz I don't recognize these chains
I think I made a bad mistake
CHORUS
'Cause once I ran away
I've loved you since the day
The day I broke your heart (heart heart heart heart)
It's more than I can take
I loved you since the day
The day we fell apart (part, part part part)
Now everything is coming under
'Cuz you were the chance I can't afford to waste
I loved you since the day
The day we fell apartt
I must admit the grass looks so much greener
On the other side
Since you left I notice now you're so much meaner
And it's something I think I like
Tell me whats this desperation
'Cuz I don't recognize these chains
I think I made a bad mistake
CHORUS
