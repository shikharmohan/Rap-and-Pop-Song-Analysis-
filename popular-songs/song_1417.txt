All he could think about was
I'm too young for this
Got my whole life ahead
Hell I'm just a kid myself
How 'm I gonna raise one
All he could see were his dreams
Goin' up in smoke
So much for ditchin' this town
And hangin' out on the coast
Oh well, those plans are long gone
And he said
"There goes my life
There goes my future, my everything
Might as well kiss it all goodbye
There goes my life"
A couple years of up all night and
Few thousand diapers later
That mistake he thought he made
Covers up the refrigerator
Oh yea, he loves that little girl
Mamma's waitin' to tuck her in
As she fumbles up those stairs
She smiles back at him
Draggin' that teddy bear, sleep tight
Blue eyes and bouncin' curls
He smiles
"There goes my life
There goes my future, my everything
I love you Daddy, good night
There goes my life"
She had that Honda loaded down
With Abercrombie clothes
And fifteen pairs of shoes
And his American Express
He checked the oil, slammed the hood
Said, "You're good to go"
She hugged 'em both
And headed off to the West Coast
And he cried
"There goes my life
There goes my future, my everything
I love you, Baby, goodbye"
There goes my life
There goes my life
Baby goodbye
Baby goodbye
There goes my life
