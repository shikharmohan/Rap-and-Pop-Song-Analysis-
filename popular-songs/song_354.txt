Hey bartender, can I make one special request?
My woman left me so tonight I'll be drinkin' your best
I'm not talkin' about Single Malt, Scotch, Jagermeister or Cuervo Gold
I'll take anything domestic, light and cold
Domestic, light and cold, that's what I'm havin'
Serve me up any old iced down American classic
Pop a top, crack a can, just don't make me wait too long
I'll take anything domestic, light and cold
No, I wasn't cheatin', she just said that I was hard to please
And I'll admit it, that I can be set in my country ways
So go ahead and break out the good stuff, if I can be so bold
I'll take anything domestic, light and cold
Domestic, light and cold, that's what I'm havin'
Serve me up any old iced down American classic
Pop a top, crack a can, just don't make me wait too long
I'll take anything domestic, light and cold
You've got beer from all over the world on the wall
I can even get a free T-shirt if I try them all
But tonight I'm in the mood for some of that home grown booze
Yeah, pop a top, crack a can, just don't make me wait too long
I'll take anything domestic, hey I know what the best is
Anything domestic, light and cold
Bartender, I'll take anything domestic, light and cold, over here
Well, hello over there, that's something domestic, light and hot
Daddy likey, hi there, you, you like country music?
Oh, yeah, dude, we can't say daddy likey, can we?
