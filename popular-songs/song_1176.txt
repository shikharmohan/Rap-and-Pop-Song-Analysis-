You've got your own way of lookin' at it baby
I guess that proves that I got mine
Seems like our hearts are set on automatic
We say the first thing that comes to mind
It's just who we are
Baby we've come too far to start over now
I know what you're thinkin'
I'm not always easy to be around
But I do love you
You keep me believin' that you love me too
And I know it's true
This love drives us crazy but nobody's walkin' away
So I guess we'll have to do it the hard way
If I had a genie in a bottle
Three wishes, I could wish for us
I wish we'd live forever and get along together
Turn these tempers into trust
Ohh ohh
'Cause I do love you
You keep me believin' that you love me too
And I know it's true
This love drives us crazy but nobody's walkin' away
So I guess we'll have to do it the hard way
Do it the hard way
It's just who we are
Baby we've come too far to start over now
Believe me tonight love's the one thing in life
We can't live without
And I do love you
You keep me believin' that you love me too
And I know it's true
This love drives us crazy but nobody's walkin' away
So I guess we'll have to do it the harder way
Do it the hard way
Umm hmm
The hard way
Ooo ooo ooo
Hmm hmm
