You don't know what you're doin'
What you're doin' to me
Tryin' to stop it, can't stop it
'Cause you got what I need
You got me all open
And now you're tryin' to leave
Hold it, don't drop it, don't drop it
Stop it, can't stop it, won't stop it
Every time I try to run
Something keeps stoppin' me
I try my best to turn around
But your touch won't let me leave
I can't control it
You put something inside of me
'Cause you're a problem
Boy, you must've poisoned me
You don't know what you're doin'
What you're doin' to me
Tryin' to stop it, can't stop it
'Cause you got what I need
You got me all open
And now you're tryin' to leave
Hold it, don't drop it, don't drop it
Stop it, can't stop it, won't stop it
Boy, I must be buggin'
Let you play those games I don't understand
I'll be the yo-yo on a string
Goin' down I come right back to your hands
I make excuses
But we keep on rockin' anyway
But it ain't workin'
When I let you go you make me stay
You don't know what you're doin'
What you're doin' to me
Tryin' to stop it, can't stop it
'Cause you got what I need
You got me all open
And now you're tryin' to leave
Hold it, don't drop it, don't drop it
Stop it, can't stop it, won't stop it
Don't let me leave
Control on me
Got what I need
Hold it, don't drop it, don't drop it
Stop it, can't stop it, won't stop it
Won't let you go, can't let you leave
  (Don't let me leave)
I need your love inside of me
  (Control on me)
You got control, control of me
  (Got what I need)
Hold it, don't drop it, don't drop it
Stop it, can't stop it, won't stop it
You don't know what you're doin'
What you're doin' to me
Tryin' to stop it, can't stop it
'Cause you got what I need
You got me all open
And now you're tryin' to leave
Hold it, don't drop it, don't drop it
Stop it, can't stop it, won't stop it
You don't know what you're doin'
What you're doin' to me
Tryin' to stop it, can't stop it
'Cause you got what I need
You got me all open
And now you're tryin' to leave
Hold it, don't drop it, don't drop it
Stop it, can't stop it, won't stop it
