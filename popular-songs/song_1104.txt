What kind of spell is this
that you've cast on me with your kiss
its like i've lost all control of my senses 
Its just not like me, to give in so easily
and dropping my thought and im leaving my heart defenseless 
Oh, but im feelin good here beneath the pines of the Georgia woods
Chorus:
And what a surprise, hear by my side 
Its more than a full moonshine and its driving me crazy 
I waited so long, something is strong 
And now i gotta be fallin cuz im already callin you baby
Theres nobody hear to see
the sparks between you and me
We better be careful my love or these woods will be burning
Or maybe we just give in, throw caution to the wind
Its funny how we aint got any say in the matter
Chorus:
And what a surprise, hear by my side
Its more than a full moonshine and its driving me crazy
I waited so long, something is strong
And i gotta be fallin cuz im already callin you baby
uh huh
oh take me down town 
uh huh
Yeah, i waited so long, somethin is strong 
And i know im falling cuz im already callin you 
oh
what a surprise, hear by your side
Its more than a full moonshine and its driving me crazy
oh waited so long, something is strong
And we know im fallin cuz im already callin you 
oh callin you baby
yeah, uh huh
