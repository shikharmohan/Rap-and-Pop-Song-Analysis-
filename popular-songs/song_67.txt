So there's somewhere you gotta be
Well, I sure hate to see you leave
I'll break my grip but babe you need to know
Next time I might not let you go
I know what you said and I wanted that too
But takin' it slow is gettin' harder to do
It's feelin' more and more like forever
Holdin' you close
And next time I might not let you go
Good thing I don't get paid to think
'Cause I sure thought I had the strength
To fight love off but my resistance is runnin' low
And next time I might not let you go
Yeah, I know what you said and I wanted that too
But takin' it slow is gettin' harder to do
It's feelin' more and more like forever
Holdin' you close
And next time I might not let you go
Yeah, next time I just might
Hold on for dear life
Yeah, next time I might not let you go
Next time I might not let you go
And so there's somewhere you gotta be
Well, I sure hate to see you leave
