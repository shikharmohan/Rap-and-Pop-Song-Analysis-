Who wants to be right as rain, it's better when something is wrong.
You get excitement in your bones and everything you do is a game.
When night comes and your on your own you can say I chose to be alone.
Who wants to be right as rain, it's harder when you're on top.
'Cause when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired,
There ain't no room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned.
So wipe that dirty smile of, We
won't be making up, I've cried my heart out 
and now I've had enough of love.
Who wants to be riding high when you'll just crumble back on down.
You give up everything you are and even then you don't get far.
They make believe that everything is exactly what it seems.
But at least when you're at your worst, you'll know how to feel things.
'Cause when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired,
There ain't no room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned.
So wipe that dirty smile of, We
won't be making up, I've cried my heart out 
and now I've had enough of love.
Go ahead and steal my heart to make me cry again,
'cause it will never hurt as much it did then,
when we were both right and no one had blame,
but now I give up on this endless game.
'Cause who wants to be right as rain, it's better when something is wrong.
I get excitement in my bones, even though everything's a strain.
When night comes and I'm on my own, you should know I chose to be alone.
Who wants to be right as rain, it's harder when you're on top.
'Cause when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired,
There ain't no room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned.
So wipe that dirty smile of, We
won't be making up, I've cried my heart out 
and now I've had enough of love. (2x)
