Yeah, she looks so good in that white dress
At the far end of the aisle
Standing where I should be standing
Some other man, on his face there's a smile
I just walked in, sat down silent
I stood outside for awhile
Wondering why did I come here
Face it, you messed up
And now she's with somebody else, yeah, yeah
And now all I can do is smile
And fade into the background
I'll say congratulations and
I'll fade into the background
Such a lovely reception
I sit here sipping RosÃÂ©
Then we catch eyes for a second
Both of us smile then quickly look away
It's funny you don't know what you got
Till you ain't got it no more
Put down my glass, grab the bottle
I throw it back and I shout she with somebody else
And now all I can do is smile
And fade into the background
I'll say congratulations and
I'll fade into the background
I'll say congratulations and
I'll fade into the background
Sure hate to fade into the background
She's with somebody else
And now all I can do is smile
And fade into the background
I'll say congratulations and
I'll fade into the background
