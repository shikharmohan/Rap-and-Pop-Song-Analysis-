She took the TV and the toaster
She took the curtains and the car
I guess she took for granted
I wouldn't take it very hard
And for someone in a hurry
She took her own sweet time
But it's not what she took that hurt
It's what she left behind
A bedroom full of memories
That time cannot erase
Photographs of the two of us
That she said, "Throw away"
She took my heart and soul
And left me here to lose my mind
No, it's not what she took that hurt
It's what she left behind
She said, "I've given you my best
But I can't take no more"
She said, "I've run out of reasons
Then she walked out the door"
It's gonna take a lot of doin'
To get over her goodbye
'Cause it's not what she took that hurt
It's what she left behind
A bedroom full of memories
That time cannot erase
Photographs of the two of us
That she said, "Throw away"
She took my heart and soul
And left me here to lose my mind
No, it's not what she took that hurt
It's what she left behind
She took my heart and soul
And left me here to lose my mind
No, it's not what she took that hurt
It's what she left behind
