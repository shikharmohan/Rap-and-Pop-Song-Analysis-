There's things in my life
That I've been missin'
The touch of a woman
And lovin' after dark
Come here lately
The woman I've been kissin'
She comes from Kentucky boys
And she don't have a heart
Bartender, he don't mind
He just sets 'em up the same
I ain't been sober since it's over
Got no plans to change
I traded my tomorrows
To remain in yesterday
Whiskey tears are fallin' here
And each one cries her name
I used to be so afraid of dyin'
I lived every moment for lovin' her
But when she walked away my heart quit tryin'
And now I'm no stranger to the hurt
Bartender, he don't mind
He just sets 'em up the same
I ain't been sober since it's over
Got no plans to change
I traded my tomorrows
To remain in yesterday
Whiskey tears are fallin' here
And each one cries her name
Bartender, he don't mind
He sets 'em up the same
Oh, whiskey tears are fallin' here
And each one cries her name
