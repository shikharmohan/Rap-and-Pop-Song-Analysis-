I watch you as you wake and rub your eyes
And try to hide them from the morning sun
I whisper, "How ya doing?"
And you smile and say so tenderly, "Good morning"
Last night you made his memory fade a little
You helped me see how love can still be right
I wish you didn't have to leave
If you just knew how much I need last night, every night
I know you have to catch a plane to Memphis
And you mentioned it's an early flight
You start to pack and while I comb my hair
I stare at you and think about last night
'Cause last night you made his memory fade a little
You helped me see how love can still be right
I wish you didn't have to leave
If you just knew how much I need last night, every night
I slip into my robe to go make coffee
You come in and pull me close to you
And as I feel your tender kiss
I whisper, "Can't Memphis wait a day or two?"
'Cause last night you made his memory fade a little
You helped me see how love can still be right
I wish you didn't have to leave
If you just knew how much I need last night, every night
'Cause Last night you made his memory fade a little
You helped me see how love can still be right
I wish you didn't have to leave
If you just knew how much I need last night, every night
