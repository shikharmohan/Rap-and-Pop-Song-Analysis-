Monkey see, monkey do, I don't know why I
[incomprehensible], I don't know why I
Leave it out, keep it in, I don't know why I
Have to have poison skin, I don't know why I
Pay, pay to play
Pay to play, pay to play
Walk an inch, take a mile, I don't know why I
Never fade, never smile, I don't know why I
Never mind, eat and run, I don't know why I
Fuck your ass for the fun, I don't know why I
Pay, Pay to play
Pay to play, pay to play
I don't know why I
I don't know why I
Pay, Pay to play
Pay to play, pay to play
Monkey see, monkey do, I don't know why I
[incomprehensible], I don't know why I
Leave it out, keep it in, I don't know why I
Have to have poison skin, I don't know why I
Pay, Pay to play
Pay to play, pay to play
I don't know why I
I don't know why I
Pay, Pay to play
Pay to play, pay to play
Pay to play, pay to play, pay to play
Pay to play, pay to play, pay to play
Pay to play, pay to play
