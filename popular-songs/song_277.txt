Going round round round
CiCi will have you going round round round round
Darkchild you got me going round round round round
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby
I like to party all night, you'll see
And you're exactly the type that I need
My hi-hat drives you Congo and you know
That I can make the bass beat beat solo
Do that again, again, spin me around
Do that again, again, I'm gon' put it down
I got you runnin', goin' crazy, you don't know what it is
I'm in control, baby I-I-I-I
You know how I gets down 
Let me know right now if you can keep up, switch!
Try to turn me down, cause I hit so loud 
Overload your speakers, switch!
When the lights go down, all the freaks come out
And I know you see 'em, switch!
Then me on you now, switch!
And then you on me, lets switch!
Let's slow it down to this beat baby
I got you right where I need, and you'll see
Turn up the 808 more, make me
Feel the snare in my car, I need more
Do it again, again, spin me around
Do it again, again, I'm gon' put it down
I got you runnin', goin' crazy, you don't know what it is
I'm in control, baby I-I-I-I
You know how I gets down 
Let me know right now if you can keep up, switch!
Try to turn me down, cause I hit so loud 
Overload your speakers, switch!
When the lights go down, all the freaks come out
And I know you see 'em, switch!
Then me on you now, switch!
And then you on me, lets switch!
I like when you do this to me
Make me wanna tear it up
The way you move me, it's music to me
I just wanna turn it up
Higher level, highest level, feel like I can't be without you
Take you to a bass in no time
My body on your's, and your's on mine
You know how I gets down 
Let me know right now if you can keep up, switch!
Try to turn me down, cause I hit so loud 
Overload your speakers, switch!
When the lights go down, all the freaks come out
And I know you see 'em, switch!
Then me on you now, switch!
And then you on me, lets switch!
I'm gon' release, release, release then switch
Release, release, release then switch
Release, release, release then switch
Release, release, release then switch
