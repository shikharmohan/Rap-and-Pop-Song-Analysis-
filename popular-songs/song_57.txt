Well, I parked my car in the driveway
Somewhere around 1 a.m.
Worn out from the road with a big heavy load
On my mind, what a week it had been
Then I stumbled into the kitchen
I saw that little red light
Blinkin' at me from my message machine
Then I knew it would all be alright
'Cause she said
"Baby, come over tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
Baby, come hold me tonight
I'm a little bit lonely"
Now, it didn't take me a second
'Til I knew the right thing to do
I picked up the phone and said
"Baby, I'm home
I'll be there in a minute or two"
I stole some of my neighbor's daisies
Grabbed an old bottle of wine
She don't call me much but I know when she does
That I'm in for one hell of a time
When she says
"Baby, come over tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
Baby, come hold me tonight
I'm a little bit lonely"
"Baby, baby, baby, just for tonight
Be my one and only
Baby, come over tonight
I'm a little bit lonely"
Yeah, everybody needs a little love sometimes
Yeah, and who am I to leave you hangin' high and dry
No baby, not tonight, no, no, no, no
Not tonight, now baby
Baby, come over tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
Baby, come hold me tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
Baby, baby, just come hold me tight
You don't have to call me
Baby, baby, come over tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
I'm lonely, lonely, lonely
So come on, baby
Said, "I'll be there in a minute or two"
And I brought those daises and that red wine
We had one hell of a time
Yeah, yeah, yeah
