I hope I don't make you mad, with what I'm 'bout to say boy
Here we are once again, and I'm havin' second thoughts boy
I'm not messin' with yo head, but I changed my mind boy
I don't know why I'm here, the same time I want you near
If you want me to leave, I will understand
See I will just have to respect your wishes boy
Cus if I stay ain't no tellin' what may happen boy
Although you look so good to me, it's best that I leave
I'm scared of being next to you, because of what I think I might do
Boy you're turnin' me on right now
I can't get down like that right now
I don't want to disturb the flow, this is not my M O
Hold up, wait a minute, movin' too fast
I want some like this here to last
Don't say no baby, not right now baby
I want you to be my lady, you got me goin' crazy
Well I guess I'll stay for a minute, then I'll have to go boy
This moment is so temptin', right now it's not what I want boy
Maybe if we just embrace, with a simple kiss, boy
But that'll only make things worse
Hope I'm not gettin' on your nerves boy
I just wanted to be right for the both of us
When you don't have to say a thing to make me comfortable
Boy, you make me so weak when you look at me
Right now I'm a little confused, I think it's best that I refuse
I'm scared of being next to you, because of what I think I might do
Boy you're turnin' me on right now
I can't get down like that right now
Don't want to disturb the flow, this is not my M O
Hold up, wait a minute, movin' too fast
I want some like this here to last
Supposed to be playin' cards and watchin' a movie
But we keep lockin' eyes boy, now why you tryin' to tease me
This room is gettin' heated could you open up a window
I think that I should go now, 'cause I can't take this no more
I'm scared of being next to you, because of what I think I might do
Boy you're turnin' me on right now
I can't get down like that right now
I don't want to disturb the flow, this is not my M O
Hold up, wait a minute, movin' too fast
I want some like this here to last
I'm scared of being next to you, because of what I think I might do
Boy you're turnin' me on right now
I can't get down like that right now
Don't want to disturb the flow, this is not my M O
Hold up, wait a minute, movin' too fast
I want some like this here to last
I'm scared of being next to you, because of what I think I might do
Boy you're turnin' me on right now
I can't get down like that right now
Don't want to disturb the flow, this is not my M O
Hold up, wait a minute, movin' too fast
I want some like this here to last
