South of the border, American dollars
Take you a long, long way
Beachside bungalows, sand between your toes
Nobody knows your name
There's a worm at the bottom of a bottle
That's well within my reach
And the heart that you broke will soon be a joke
As soon as he and I meet
Oh, forgetting's cheap in Mexico
She'll be there waiting and she won't say no
Tequila loves me even if you don't
Madam Tequila's a fine senorita
All my compadres concur
She won't lie, she won't leave in your hour of need
So we're raisin' our glasses to her
They say, "Valmos hecharlo el traga"
It means 'Drink it all down 'til you see'
The bottom of the glass and it's kickin' your ass
Boys, the next round's on me
Oh, forgetting's cheap in Mexico
She'll be there waiting and she won't say no
Tequila loves me even if you don't
Oh, forgetting's cheap in Mexico
She'll be there waiting and she won't say no
Tequila loves me even if you don't
Oh, forgetting's cheap in Mexico
She'll be there waiting and she won't say no
Tequila loves me even if you don't
Oh, oh, oh
