I was sitting on my doorstep
I hung up the phone and it fell out of my hand
But I knew I had to do it
And he wouldn't understand
So hard to see myself without him
I felt a piece of my heart break
But when you're standing at a crossroad
There's a choice you gotta make
I guess it's gonna have to hurt
I guess I'm gonna have to cry
And let go of some things I've loved
To get to the other side
I guess it's gonna break me down
Like fallin' when you try to fly
Sad but sometimes
Moving on with the rest of your life
Starts with goodbye
I know there's a blue horizon
Somewhere up ahead, just waiting for me
Getting there means leaving things behind
Sometimes life's so bitter sweet
I guess it's gonna have to hurt
I guess I'm gonna have to cry
And let go of some things I've loved
To get to the other side
I guess it's gonna break me down
Like fallin' when you try to fly
It's sad but sometimes
Moving on with the rest of your life
Starts with goodbye
Time heals the wounds that you feel
Somehow, right now
I guess it's gonna have to hurt
I guess I'm gonna have to cry
And let go of some things I've loved
To get to the other side
I guess it's gonna break me down
Like fallin' when you try to fly
It's sad but sometimes
Moving on with the rest of your life
Starts with goodbye
I guess I'm gonna have to cry
And let go of some things I've loved
To get to the other side
Start to wave goodbye
Like fallin' when you try to fly
It's sad but sometimes
Moving on with the rest of your life
Starts with goodbye
