Standing at the back door she tried to make it fast
One tear hit the hard wood it fell like broken glass
She said, "Sometimes love slips away
And you just can't get it back, let's face it"
For one split second, she almost turned around
But that would be like pouring rain drops back into a cloud
So she took another step and said
"I see the way out and I'm gonna' take it"
I don't wanna spend my life jaded, waiting
To wake up one day and find
That I've let all these years go by wasted
Another glass of whiskey but it still don't kill the pain
So he stumbles to the sink and pours it down the drain
He says, "It's time to be a man and stop living for yesterday
Gotta face it"
'Cause I don't wanna spend my life jaded, waiting
To wake up one day and find
That I've let all these years go by wasted
Oh I don't wanna keep on wishing, missing
The still of the morning, the color of the night
I ain't spending no more time wasted
She kept drivin' along
'Til the moon and the sun were floating side-by-side
He looked in the mirror and his eyes were clear
For the first time in a while, yeah yeah
Oh, I don't wanna spend my life jaded, waiting
To wake up one day and find
That I've let all these years go by wasted
Oh I don't wanna keep on wishing, missing
The still of the morning, the color of the night
I ain't spending no more time wasted
Oh I don't wanna spend my life jaded, waiting
To wake up one day and find
That I've let all these years go by wasted, yeah, yeah
Oh I don't wanna keep on wishing, missing
The still of the morning, the color of the night
I ain't spending no more time wasted
