You know fairytales don't come true
Not when it comes to you
Open up for the first time
And you can bet that it's the last time
And I'm cool with laying low
Saturday night and I'm staying home
I'm feeling good for the first time
It's been a while since the last time
I'll wave goodbye when you say hello
I'm sick of the sleepless, never ending nights
I just don't care who was wrong or right
I'm sick of the rumours and the alibis 
you tear me up, I'll cut you down in size
I'm so sick of you, so sick of you
Sick of all your little lies
I'm so sick of you, so sick of you
So sick of all the girls by your side
What you don't know,
Is how great it feels, to let you go
I quit your game,
It's so see through
You know I'm way to good for you
Moving on to the next time
Track the baggage and I'll be fine
With time to reminisce , your going to realize you missed this
Your in my mind for the last time
And at the most you were a past time
I'll wave goodbye when you say hello
I'm sick of the sleepless, never ending nights
I just don't care who was wrong or right
I'm sick of the rumours and the alibis 
You tear me up, I'll cut you down to size
I'm so sick of you, so sick of you
Sick of all of your little lies
I'm so sick of you, so sick of you
So sick of feeling right by your side
What you don't know,
Is how great it feels, to let you go
I'm happy you're alone
Take down your pictures and I'll throw,
Those memories out the door, I'm
Sick of you, so sick of you, sick of all your little lies
I'm sick of the sleepless, never ending nights
I just don't care who was wrong or right
I'm sick of the rumours and the alibis 
You tear me up, I'll cut you down to size
S-s-s so sick of you, so sick of you,
Sick of all your little lies
S-s- so sick of you, so sick of you
So I'm getting on with my life
S-s-s sick of you, so sick of you,
So sick of you
Woah-oh (x2)
What you don't know,
Is how great it feels, to let you go
