Hey darkness, don't you try
To steal the moment or close my eyes
I won't let you in
'Cause this feels too damn good to me
All I want and all I need
Is her touch again and again and again
I don't wanna go to sleep tonight
I don't want anything to change
I don't wanna wake up and find a different day
Yeah, she makes me free
Here between the day and the twilight
I don't wanna go to sleep tonight
Time stop dead in your tracks
Turn around and don't look back
And just let us be
I'm gonna take this time and soak it up
Forever wouldn't be long enough
If you knew her, you'd agree, agree with me
I don't wanna go to sleep tonight
I don't want anything to change
I don't wanna wake up and find a different day
Yeah, she makes me free
Here between the day and the twilight
I don't wanna, I don't wanna go to sleep tonight
I wish the sun would just forget to come up
And leave us wrapped up in this love
I don't wanna go to sleep tonight
I don't want anything to change
I don't wanna wake up and find a different day
Yeah, she makes me free
Here between the day and the twilight
I don't wanna go to sleep tonight
I don't wanna go to sleep tonight
I don't wanna go, I don't wanna go
I don't wanna go to sleep tonight
