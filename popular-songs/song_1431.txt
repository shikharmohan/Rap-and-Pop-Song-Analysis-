For me it's a beach bar
Or on a boat underneath the stars
Or with my band up on a stage
For a while everything's okay
For some it's a fast car
Moonshine in a mason jar
And everybody has their way
Somehow to escape
Reality, yeah, sometimes life
Ain't all that it's cracked up to be
So let's take a chance and live this fantasy
'Cause everybody needs to break free from reality, oh yeah
Yeah, some days it's a bitch, it's a bummer
We need a rock 'n' roll show in the summer
To let the music take us away
Take our minds to a better place
Where we feel that sense of freedom
Leave our worries behind, we don't need 'em
All we need is a sunny day and an old tailgate
And we'll escape
Reality, yeah, sometimes life
Ain't all that it's cracked up to be
So let's take a chance and live this fantasy
'Cause everybody needs to break free from reality
Everybody raise your hands and voice tonight
Set your soul free, let's take a carpet ride
We'll leave it all behind, oh yeah
Oh, reality, yeah, sometimes life
Ain't all that it's cracked up to be
So let's take a chance and live this fantasy
'Cause everybody needs to break free from reality
Yeah, oh yeah
Come on everybody, break free
Come on everybody, break free
