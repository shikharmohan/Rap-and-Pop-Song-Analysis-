We haven't met
And that's okay
'Cause you will be asking for me one day
Don't want to wait
In line
The moment is mine believe me
Don't close your eyes
'Cause it's a chance worth takin'
And I think that I can shake you
[Chorus:]
I know where I stand
I know who I am
I would never run away when life gets bad, it's
Everything I see
Every part of me
Gonna get what I deserve
I got nerve (I got I got I got)
Electrified, I'm on a wire
Getting together we're on fire
What I said you heard
Now I got you spinning
Don't close your mind
The words I use are open
And I think that I can show you
[Chorus:]
I know where I stand
I know who I am
I would never run away when life gets bad, it's
Everything I see
Every part of me
I know I can change the world, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know what you like
I know what you think
Not afraid to stare you down until you blink, it's
Everything I see
Every part of me
Gonna get what I deserve
I got nerve
