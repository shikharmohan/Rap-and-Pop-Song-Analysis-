It's just a piece of paper, it says, "In God we trust"
And a little sure felt good, but a lot was not enough
And everybody loved me when I was on a roll
And I thought I had everything when I held the gold
But You're not my God and You're not my friend
You're not the one that I will walk with in the end
You're not the truth, You are a temporary shot
And You ruin people's lives and You don't give a second thought
You're not my God
Little white lies on a mirror cut neatly in a roll
Medicine that kept me from lookin' in my soul
I thought yYou were the answer to all of my despair
And You almost had me six feet down but I'm still breathin' air
Oh 'cause You're not my God and You're not my friend
You're not the one that I will walk with in the end
You're not the truth, You are a temporary shot
And You ruin people's lives and You don't give a second thought
You're not my God
From the cradle to the grave temptations all around
But no matter how good the fix it's gonna take You down
Now some call it a weakness, some call it a sin
But it's all the same behind each game, I see Your evil grin
And You're not my God and You're not my friend
And You're not the one that I will walk with in the end
And You're not the truth, You are a temporary shot
And You ruin people's lives and You don't give a second thought
You're not my God and You're not my friend
You're not the one that I will walk with in the end
You're not the truth, You are a temporary shot
And You ruin people's lives and You don't give a second thought
And You're not my God
And You're not my God
Oh, oh, oh, You're not my God
You're not my God
Not my God, not my God
You're not, You're not, You're not my God
