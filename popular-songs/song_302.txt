[Ciara]
I go hard, I go hard in the A boy
Don't play boy, album on the way boy
First name: multi-platnium, last name: triple threat
7 years in the game and I even finish yet
Raymond Prince is from the A and ain't nobody blockin' that
This is for my girls who be po-po-poppin' that
Waka Flocka that's my f**king partna
Shoe game sick, so sick, call the doctor
Still rock gucci, ain't I role wit Gucci (bur)
The cameras stay rolling, you would think I'm in a movie
Long legs, daisy dukes, yeah them Georgia peaches out
Think this cornbread, yeah that's how do it in the south
I used to be the one wit the godies yall
Now them godies taste better when they in ya ow
Just ask about me and my name rigs plenty bells
Eastside, Westside, in the ATL
I know I been away for too long
Now I got my shit right and it's on (ciara ho)
I go hard, I go hard in the A boy
Don't play boy, album on the way boy
I go hard, I go hard in the A boy
Don't play boy, album on the way boy (album on the way)
