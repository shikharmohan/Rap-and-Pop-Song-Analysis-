Woke up this mornin'
The house was cold
Checked the furnace she wasn't burnin'
Went out and hopped in my old Ford
Hit the engine but she ain't a turnin'
Givin' each other some hard lessons lately
But we ain't learnin'
Same sad story that's a fact
Once step up and two steps back
Bird on a wire outside my motel room but he ain't singin'
Girl in white outside a church in June
But the church bells they ain't ringin'
Sittin' here in this bar tonight
And all I'm thinkin' is
I'm the same old story same old act
One step up and two steps back 
It's the same thing night all night
Who's wrong and baby who's right
Another fight and I slam the door on
Another battle and a dirty little war
When I look at myself I don't see the man I wanted to be
Somewhere along the line I slipped off track
Movin' one step up and two steps back
There's a girl across the bar
I get the message she's sendin'
Mmm she ain't lookin too married
Me, we well honey I'm pretendin'
Last night I dreamed I held you in my amrs 
The music was never endin' 
We danced as the evening sky faded to black
Movin' one step up and two steps up
(one step up and two steps back)
One step up and two steps back
(one step up and two steps back)
One step up and two steps back
(one step up and two steps back)
One step up and two steps back
Ohhh..baby we're movin
One step up and two steps back
One step up and two steps back
One step up and two steps back
Mmm..one step up and two steps back
(one step up and two steps back)
(one step up and two steps back)
