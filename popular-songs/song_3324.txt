[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Morale is short and my heart and my brain and spirit's out of order
And now the Lord ? how thou recorda (Ehr)
Fallen angel warrior at the bottom drain the ? horror destroyer in the middle of Sodom and Gomorra
Punk shit all around everybody been callin clown
? crawl in town get wicked wit the sickness is fallin down
Over this basic gay shit erase it face it
Wake this hatred and make this place get ape shit
No kinda way you stoppin this (Chaa)
Flow gotta make apocalypse
Powers stop lots of mocking shit lot of us soft and it's blockin this optimus (Chaa)
Positive hope for the future's loss of awesomeness
I can get boss and a lot of this will rot and pop like hot sausages (Chaa)
I am not the light I'm the opposite (Chaa)
From a narcissistic awfulness
I'm keepin Tech off of his rocker (Chaa)
Black white and darker (Chaa)
Peep it this is the thesis wrote in feces
I'm as beast as broken leashes little secret
I am The Seepage
[Chorus: Tonesha Sanders & Tech N9ne]
Heartless darkness, I feel it seepin out of me
Watch this raw shit, seepin out the anatomy
Heartless darkness, I feel it seepin out of me
It's gotten me noxious the seepage deep inside of me
Touch it (Touch it)
Feel it (Feel it)
Love it (Love it)
Seepage (Seepage)
Touch it (Touch it)
Feel it (Feel it)
Love it (Love it)
Seepage (Seepage)
[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Do you believe in Kod (Ehr) yes when you see them nod
He's in season the reason light is leavin he's even odd (Chaa)
All sixes and sevens (Chaa) mauled bitches and reverends (Chaa) frauds quick gonna get ? with the hog pit it is in heaven (Chaa)
Dark shit if he's the messenger when he take a threat then bless a wet nigga instead of gettin a stretcher put death in a replica
Dat is the (Chaa) weakest piece of release but the seepage has no descretion for checkin bro with a plathora of weapons to lessen ya (Chaa)
Big Yates hes stuck in the six states I'm speakin that his fate to be wack when he gets cake
Well, he gets cake and the critics they spit hate but the sinister shit shakes so long to The Mixplate (Chaa)
I just ate (Chaa) pretty punani and mustard psychos and lust stars
Skeetin seepage these nuts charred (Ehr)
What I got to say to the people who pick at and gut stars
Thinkin Imma lose the ability to bust hard you fuck tards
[Chorus: Tonesha Sanders & Tech N9ne]
Heartless darkness, I feel it seepin out of me
Watch this raw shit, seepin out the anatomy
Heartless darkness, I feel it seepin out of me
It's gotten me noxious the seepage deep inside of me
Touch it (Touch it)
Feel it (Feel it)
Love it (Love it)
Seepage (Seepage)
Touch it (Touch it)
Feel it (Feel it)
Love it (Love it)
Seepage (Seepage)
[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
The Kod's a hot head
The shocks and the socks red and the darkness is not dead we can ?lock up like mop heads? (Ehr)
Chop heads of suckas like my name was Ahmed Allah hu-akbar  I get out on dontes yechtes (Chaa)
? motherfuckers I'm coming out of his nose
I'm runnin out of his toes
His throat and clouded his soul (Ehr)
Peep his crowd as it grows
No matter which route is chose
He's climbin right out his grove
Don't doubt it how loud it blows
