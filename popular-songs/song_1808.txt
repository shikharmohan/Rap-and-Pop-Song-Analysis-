Sha...Sha...Sha
I probably shouldn't say this
But at times I get so scared
When I think about the previous
Relationship we shared
It was awesome,
But we lost it
It's not possible for me, not to care
And now we're standin in the rain
But nothings ever gunna change
Until you here, my dear
The 7 things I hate about you 
The 7 things I hate about you, oh you
You're vein, 
Your games, 
You're insecure
You love me, 
You like her, 
You make me laugh, 
You make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks 
When you act like them just to know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seven thing I hate the most that you do, 
You make me love you
It's awkward and silent 
As I wait for you to say
What I need to here now
Is your sincere apology
When you mean it, 
I'll believe it
If you text it, 
I'll delete it
Let's be clear
Oh I'm not coming back
You're taking 7 steps here
The 7 things I hate about you
You're vein, 
Your games, 
You're insecure,
You love me, 
You like her, 
You make me laugh,
You make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks 
When you act like them just to know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seven things I hate the most that you do, 
You make me love you
And compared to all the great things
That would take too long to write
I probably should mention 
The 7 that I like
The 7 things I like about you
Your hair, 
Your eyes, 
Your old Levi's,
When we kiss I'm hypnotized
You make me laugh, 
You make me cry
But I guess that's both I'll have to buy
Your hands in mine when we're intertwined
Everything's alright
I wanna be with the one I know.
And the seven thing I like the most that you do, ohhhh
You make me love you
Sha
