[Justin:]
I've been wonderin' if it's time
To say what's on my mind
'Cause I'm in the dark
So what's in your heart?
I'm tryin' to find
[Kelly:]
I don't even know your name
But the thought of you remains
Suddenly my pulse is jumpin'
Do you feel the same?
I talk it over with my friends
And I guess it all depends
How you really feel
What can you comprehend?
[Both:]
You could be just 'round the corner now
Hoping this love is yet to be found
[Chorus (Both:)]
It's not too late to call my name
So don't you look the other way
Open your eyes and you'll see
My heart won't wait, don't hesitate
We got a chance we gotta take
Feels like you could be forever part of me
[Justin:]
It's gettin' right under my skin
(Right under my skin)
I don't know where to begin
[Kelly:]
Would I look the fool?
[Justin:]
Should I play it cool?
[Both:]
Or jump right in?
[Kelly:]
How am I supposed to know
(Know)
Whether I should come or go?
(Come or go)
[Both:]
I think it's time we let our feelings show
[Both:]
We might let that moment just pass us by
Then it's gone in the blink of an eye
[Repeat Chorus]
