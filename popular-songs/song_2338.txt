1st verse:
At the movies one night, 
sportin apple bottom jeans and them gucci boots, 
saw you walkin my way, 
with some M&M;'s and a mountain dew, 
the way you switch ya booty when you walk by, 
and ya handcuffed to a nigga but its alright, 
girl before ya go, 
slide ya numba on the low
chorus:
I wanna fool wit you, 
are you down wit that, wit no strings attached, 
I wanna fool wit you, 
keep it on the low, 
he aint gotta know, 
I wanna fool wit you, 
gotsta put it down, 
when yo man aint around, 
I wanna fool wit you
2nd verse:
I see ya sittin real close, 
got ya man on the side, 
but we doin the most, 
ya put my hand on yo thigh, 
so I can feel underneath your clothes,
aint nobody knowin and its so hot, 
got a nigga goin baby don't stop, 
can't be more than just a lover, 
but for now we undercover
(chorus)
3rd verse:
Can sneak out the exit door, 
go into the movies so he won't know, 
when we sip on the cris,

be back before the creidits roll, 
you know I know, that you want me to grab that waiste, 
and I know you know, 
that I gotta get a taste
(chorus)
