I wanna be where you are
Could it be I stayed away too long?
I wanna be where you are
Could it be I stayed away too long?
I remember I said we should split
Had a lot goin' on and you weren't part of it
You tried to reason with me, I admit
But I did, now I'm walk around so, so sick
And now I'm thinkin' for you that's a fact
Got me missin' you like L.A. misses Shaq
What I gotta do on my mission to get you back?
'Cause I'm just that way without you
Baby, baby I really didn't mean it
When I said it, I'll repeat it
I was trippin', flippin' out, it was nothin'
I was on a whole other level
Now I got it all together
I was sick but now I'm better
I was trying to push you away
Really wanted you to stay
Didn't know that was the case
It was just plain crazy
'Cause around here lately
Been thinkin' about nothing but my baby
If you're in Houston
  (Baby, I gotta be there)
Hosted in Atlanta
  (Baby, I gotta be there)
Chillin' in New York
  (Baby, I gotta be there)
Somewhere out in Puerto Rico
  (Baby, I gotta be there)
If you're in Chicago
  (Baby, I gotta be there)
Hangin' out in the MIA
  (Baby, I gotta be there)
Maybe you can be in L.A.
  (Baby, I gotta be there)
I just wanna be your lady
  (Baby, I gotta be there)
I wanna be where you are
Could it be I stayed away too long?
I wanna be where you are
Could it be I stayed away too long?
What's gone is gone and I wanna take it back
I'm not livin' in the past but now I want you back
Gotta get you, gotta get you here
I've been looking for you everywhere, everywhere, baby
I'd apologize 1000 times to you
If I could prove, prove
Baby, I'm wrong and out of breath
I've been around the world tryin' to get to you
Really didn't mean it
When I said it, I'll repeat it
I was trippin', flippin' out, it was nothin'
I was on a whole other level
Now I got it all together
I was sick, but now I'm better
I was trying to push you away
Really wanted you to stay
Didn't know that was the case
It was just plain crazy
'Cause around here lately
