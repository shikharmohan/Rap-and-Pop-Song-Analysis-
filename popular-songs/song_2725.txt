I changed my number
Bought some new clothes
Got some different records
And a new stereo
I'm gettin' over you
I'm gettin' over you
I'm goin' out dancing
Learning new jokes
I'm stayin' out later
Than I should I suppose
But I'm gettin' over you
I'm gettin' over you
I took our name off our mailbox
Redecorated our room
I'm not saying the hurtin's all gone
But it'll be gone soon
I'm gettin' over you
So what if you're not here
I'm gettin' over you
And it'll happen one of these years
I ordered make-up
From Vogue magazine
I'm taking aerobics two nights a week
And I'm getting over you
Oh, I'm getting over you
I'm gettin' over you
I'm gettin' over you
My friends come over
And they wonder why
Your picture's back on the wall
Instead of proving losing you
Don't bother me at all
I'm gettin' over you
So what if you're not here
I'm gettin' over you
It'll happen one of these years
Yeah, I'm gettin' over you
I'm gettin' over you
I'm gettin' over you, ooh, ooh
I'm gettin' over you
I'm gettin' over you
Oh babe, I'm gettin' over you
