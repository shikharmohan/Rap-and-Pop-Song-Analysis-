Baby, I need to see you
Ohhh, please come over
One you come to my room for a little game
To you I'll do very erotic things
I wanna make love, babe, very slowly
Three times in a row, all night I'll go
I love when you come over
Please come over
And when you come
It gives me fever
  (Come over)
Body next to mine
Love dance syncopated time
Sugar rush keeps me high
Sweet kiss on my thigh
I wanna make love, babe, very badly
Feels good in the air every time you're here
I love when you come over
Please come over
And when you come
It gives me fever
  (Come over)
Don't keep me waiting, anticipating
Love, I am saving for you
  (You)
Hear what I'm sayin'
You I am craving
Love is here waiting for you
  (You)
All day you're stayin'
Please no delayin'
Patiently waiting for you
  (Ohh)
Don't keep me waiting
No time for playin'
Sitting here waiting for you
  (Come over)
I love when you come over
(Please come over)
Please come over
  (I need to see you)
And when you come
It gives me fever
  (Come over)
(I need to see you)
I love when you come over
  (Make it soon)
Please come over
  (I know you wanna come over)
(Come on baby don't make me wait)
And when you come
  (I need you)
It gives me fever
  (Come over)
(I can't wait anymore)
Ahh
I love you when you come over
  (Amhh)
  (I love it)
And when you come
It gives me fever
  (It gives me fever)
Ahh
I love you when you come over
