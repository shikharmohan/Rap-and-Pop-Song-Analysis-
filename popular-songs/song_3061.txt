You caught my eye and I'm tryin' to holler at 'cha
You're walkin' by and I trip on the furniture
I'm on a ride that won't stop movin'
And I don't know exactly what I'm doin'
I see you shake, shake and I'm spinnin'
It's like I won the race, yeah I'm winning
I'm all dizzy when you're here with me
So let's bring the heat
'Cause there ain't nothing to it, just got to do it
You've got to own it, own it
Welcome to the beat of your own drum
And you got it like that, burn it up like that
Welcome to the beat of your own drum
If you got it like that, yeah, it's hot like that
Eh, eh, yeah, I'll will make you say, eh, eh
So bang a drum, bang a drum
You got me floatin' ten feet off the ground
It's like whoa, I'm not backin' down
My hearts pumpin' and it's workin' over time
I got the crazy butterflies
We're doin' it right when we're together
With you by my side it only gets better
Your on my team, we got it figured out
It's you and me no doubt
There ain't nothing to it, just got to do it
You've got to own it, own it
Welcome to the beat of your own drum
If it's hot like that, burn it up like that
Welcome to the beat, you gotta dip it down low
If you got it like that, yeah, it's hot like that
Eh, eh, yeah, I'll will make you say, eh, eh
So bang a drum, bang a drum
Yeah, bang a drum, turn it up, bang a drum
Yeah, bang a drum, turn it up, bang a drum
You caught my eye and I'm tryin' to holler at 'cha
You're walkin' by and I trip on the furniture
I'm on a ride that won't stop movin'
And I don't know exactly what I'm doin'
I see you shake, shake and I'm spinnin'
It's like I won the race, yeah I'm winning
I'm all dizzy when you're here with me
So let's bring the heat
There ain't nothing to it, bang a drum
Just got to do it, bang a drum
You've got to own it, own it
Welcome to the beat, you gotta dip it down low
If you got it like that, burn it up like that
Welcome to the beat of your own drum
If you got it like that, yeah it's hot like that
Eh, eh, yeah, I'll will make you say, eh, eh
So bang a drum, bang a drum
Yeah, bang a drum, turn it up, bang a drum

Bang a drum, turn it up, bang a drum
Yeah, bang a drum, turn it up, bang a drum
