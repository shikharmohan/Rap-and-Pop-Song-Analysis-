Like a summer breeze floating across the water
Softer than a whisper on my skin
I can't begin to tell you how it moves me
It's so intense I burn within
When she gets close to me my emotions break free
And I just wanna hold on to her permanently
It's like nothing else my heart has ever felt
It's unbelieveably heavenly when she gets close to me
She walks across the room just like an angel
And I get that funny feeling deep inside
Pulls up a chair and sits down at the table
I come to laugh whoa there's nothing like
When she gets close to me my emotions break free
And I just wanna hold on to her permanently
It's like nothing else my heart has ever felt
It's unbelieveably heavenly when she gets close to me
Woah no one has ever touched me like this
Set me on fire with just one sweet gentle kiss
Amazing that's what it is
When she gets close to me my emotions break free
And I just wanna hold on to her permanently
It's like nothing else my heart has ever felt
It's unbelieveably heavenly when she gets close to me
Anywhere close to me, when she gets close to me
