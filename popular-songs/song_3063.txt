Round and round
Round and round
Round and round
Round and round 
You see me standing there 
And act like you dont know me 
But last night you were calling me 
Saying you want me 
Oh why you always make me feel 
Like I'm the one that's crazy 
You got my heart racing 
My-my heart racing 
Boy, I need you here with me 
We can't go on this way 
I'm falling hard for you 
All I can say 
We're going round and round 
We're never gonna stop 
Going round and round 
We'll never get where 
We're going 
Round and round 
Well you're gonna miss me 
'Cause I'm getting dizzy 
Going round and round 
And round 
You tried to pull me close 
And whisper in my ear 
You always told me lies 
I've cried out all my tears 
I pushed my feelings to the side 
But then you bring them back 
B-bring them back 
Now you got me singing 
Boy, I need you here with me 
We can't go on this way 
I'm falling hard for you 
All I can say 
We're going round and round 
We're never gonna stop 
Going round and round 
We'll never get where 
We're going 
Round and round 
Well you're gonna miss me 
'Cause I'm getting dizzy 
Going round and round 
And round 
Love me or Love me not 
I'm starring at the clock 
I take them flower petals off 
And then I watch them drop 
Love me or Love me not 
I'm starring at the clock 
I take them flower petals off 
And then I watch them drop 
Boy, I need you here with me 
I can't go on this way 
I'm falling hard for you 
All I can say 
Round and round 
We're never gonna stop 
Going round and round 
We'll never get where 
We're going 
Round and round 
Well you're gonna miss me 
'Cause I'm getting dizzy 
Going round and round 
And round and round
We're never gonna stop 
Going round and round 
We'll never get where 
We're going 
Round and round 
Well you're gonna miss me 
'Cause I'm getting dizzy 
Going round and round 
And round 
Whoa-oh whoa-oh whoa-oh
Whoa-oh whoa-oh whoa-oh
Whoa-oh whoa-oh whoa-oh
