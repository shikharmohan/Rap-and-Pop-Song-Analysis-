Someday, someday, someday, oh
Someday, someday, someday, oh
Someday, someday, someday, oh
Someday, someday, someday
No, boy, don't call me feisty
I worked too hard for this, oh, oh, oh
No, boy, no, boy
Can find me easy to resist
But you, boy, you, boy
I know somewhere you exist
Yeah, I'm gonna find you someday, someday
(Someday, someday, someday, someday)
I ain't gonna find you in London or Rome
Ain't gonna find you staying at home
Ain't gonna find you on the dance floor
Ain't gonna find you there for sure
I'm gonna find you if I keep living someday
(Someday, someday, someday, someday)
Hey world are you listening?
(Listening)
I got so much to say
I know it is a small world, small world
But sometimes I can't find my way
(My way)
And I know, I know, oh, it could happen any day
Just around the corner
(Just around the corner)
I'm gonna find you someday
(Someday, someday, someday, someday)
I ain't gonna find you in London or Rome
Ain't gonna find you staying at home
Ain't gonna find you on the dance floor
Ain't gonna find you there for sure
I'm gonna find you if I keep living someday
(Someday, someday, someday, someday)
Oh, oh, I'm gonna find you, I'm gonna find you
(Someday, someday, someday, someday)
I ain't gonna find you London or Rome
Ain't gonna find you staying at home
Ain't gonna find you on the dance floor
Ain't gonna find you there for sure
I'm gonna find you if I keep living someday
(someday, someday, someday, someday)
I know I'm gonna find you someday
I'm gonna find you someday
(Someday, someday, someday, someday)
