(And The Moon At Night)
ROSIE: "Who could be a more perfect fit than Reba McEntire playing Annie
Oakley on Broadway. Here to perform "I Got The Sun In The Morning", please
welcome the amazing, multi-award winning Reba McEntire and the cast of
Annie Get Your Gun.
REBA:
Got no diamonds, got no pearls 
Still I think I'm a lucky girl 
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night
Got no mansion, got no yacht 
Still I'm happy with what I got 
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night
Sunshine gives me a lovely day 
Moonlight gives me the Milky Way
Got no checkbooks, got no banks 
Still I'd like to express my thanks 
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night
And with the sun in the morning and the moon in the evenin' 
I'm all right
(tempo picks up)
Got no silver, got no gold 
What I got can't be bought or sold 
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night
(She's got the sun in the morning and the moon at night)
Sunshine gives me a lovely day 
Moonlight gives me the Milky Way
Got no eirlooms for my kin 
Never will, but when I cash in 
I'll leave the sun in the morning and the moon at night
(She'll leave the sun in the morning and the moon at night) (tempo
slows)
And with the sun in the morning and the moon in the evenin' 
I'm all right
(very fast tempo)
"Hoe-down! Yee-haa! Woo-hoo! haha! Hee Yaa! Oooh!"
Got no diamonds, got no pearls 
Still I think I'm a lucky girl!
Got no butler, got no maid 
Still I think she's an overpaid!
Hahahahah!
Got no silver, got no gold * What I got can't be bought or sold
Woo-hoo-hoo
Got no mansion * Got no yacht * Still I'm happy with what I got
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night
Sun in the morning the moon at night
And with the sun in the morning and the moon in the evening
We're all right!!!
Sun in the morning and the moon at night!
ROSIE: Oh my God! I can't wait to see that! More with Reba McEntire right
after this - don't go away!
