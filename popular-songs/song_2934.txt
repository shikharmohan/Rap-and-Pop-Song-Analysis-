Now you spread your wings to fly
There are some new things you must try
No matter where it is you go
Oh woah, don't forget your way home
I see the leaving in your eyes
I see no reason, I should try
To hold you back and keep you for my own
Oh woah, don't forget your way home
Many roads may lead you back this way
And you may change your mind someday
And when you've missed this life we've known
Oh woah, don't forget your way home
I guess, I'll always feel the same
I'll always be the keeper of this flame
And it will burn long after you're gone
Oh woah, don't forget your way home
Many roads may lead you back this way
And you may change your mind someday
When you've missed this life we've known
Don't forget your way home
