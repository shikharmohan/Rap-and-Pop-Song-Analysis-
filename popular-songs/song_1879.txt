I was livin in a sad time at home
I was hopin people would just leave me alone
I dont understand why everyone cares so much
They are all back in forth in a rush
(CHORUS) Why can't I stay underground? (underground)
That way when they keep lookin I'll never be found
Why can't they just go away?
They keep comin by everyday
Why can't I stay underground? (underground)
 
I hope no one can find me in this empty place
But trust me, somehow they will find a way
They keep taking things I say 
and twisting them to go the wrong way
(CHORUS)
leave me alone
leave me alone
leave me alone
just wanna be.....
UNDERGROUND!!!
