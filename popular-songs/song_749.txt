Jeremih:
Baby don't you know I'm here to get my lesson
Something bout your body girl
Just gives me direction how to find that spot
I ain't Young Money girl but my bed rock
So won't you let your hair down
Let me take a picture
Tell me what's your zodiac
Cancer's my description
Girl and I don't stop
That's right we go from 6 to 9 o'clock
I ain't too proud to beg, yeah
(You're my super star)
It's all up in my head oh yeah
(Cause baby you and me got some privacy)
Chorus:
I 'd like to take the time
To love your body, rub your body, kiss and hug your body
Girl say ooh ooh ooh ooh I like ooh ooh ooh ooh I like
So I'm gone take the time
To love your body, rub your body, kiss and hug your body
Girl say ooh ooh ooh ooh I like ooh ooh ooh ooh I like
Ludacris:
Let me touch your body
Like when you be fresh up out the tub and you rub that lotion
Make you get on all fours and put one leg up
Like your bodies doing three wheel motions
In the ocean, toastin, over dosin, toastin with the magic potion
Told em that they can't hold or control em no one
I'm a Magnum Trojan golden like the wrapper
Lookin dapper, then I put her on her back and attack her
No time for the chitty chat, just gimme the kitty kat
And you'll get it back after
We set the mood right
Giving you a little relaxation
Ima get your groove right
Take your body on a little vacation
We island hoppin, and clubs is rocking, and haters jockin
Trunk pop lock droppin, and speakers knockin
And bottles poppin
I could talk all day
Let me stimulate your mind
While I tell you what I like in you
But for now ima just sit back
Let jeremih tell you what he'd like to do
Chorus:
I 'd like to take the time
To love your body, rub your body, kiss and hug your body
Girl say ooh ooh ooh ooh I like ooh ooh ooh ooh I like
So I'm gone take the time
To love your body, rub your body, kiss and hug your body
Girl say ooh ooh ooh ooh I like ooh ooh ooh ooh I like
Girl say I-I-I
Girl say I-I-I
Girl say I-I-I
Girl say I-I-I
