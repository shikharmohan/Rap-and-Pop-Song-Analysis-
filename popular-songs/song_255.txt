Listen, if he don't love you by now
He ain't gon' never love you, let's go
Throw yo' hands up in the air if you know he love ya
Tell the DJ play this song right here if you know he love ya
L-l-let me see you 2 step if you know he love ya
It don't matter if you by yourself if you know he love ya
If that boy don't love you by now
He will never ever, never ever love you
He will never ever, never ever love you
If that boy don't love you by now
He will never ever, never ever love you
He will never ever, never ever love you
I know you think that I just be tripping on ya boy you see
This ain't how I normally be but I can't help this jealousy
Ooh, it's taking over me, ooh, I'm falling way too deep
Without you by my side I feel like I can't eat or sleep
But I gotta come down to earth, I don't wanna
But I gotta let you go, but baby I don't wanna
And I, I gotta see that you and me ain't meant to be
That's why I tell myself
If that boy don't love you by now
He will never ever, never ever love you
He will never ever, never ever love you
If that boy don't love you by now
He will never ever, never ever love you
He will never ever, never ever love you
I can't help but fantasize, wondering what it might be like
You and I sound so right but I'ma let it go tonight
Ain't nothing covering my eyes, ain't gonna see it more than twice
I get it, I got it, baby, baby
But I gotta come down to earth, I don't wanna
But I gotta let you go, but baby I don't wanna
And I, I gotta see that you and me ain't meant to be
That's why I tell myself
If that boy don't love you by now
He will never ever, never ever love you
He will never ever, never ever love you
If that boy don't love you by now
He will never ever, never ever love you
He will never ever, never ever love you
Girl, you gotta listen
Alright, alright, alright, okay, I see your point, I must admit
I grind, I grind, I grind all day, this paper's what I'm tryna get
Now normally when I'm paper chasing, I be having tunnel vision
And if it's really like that lady, just turn on ya television
And there go Young, I said there go Young
You tryna get it did, just know I gets it done
She love the way I cheat, she love the way I move
I sh-I show it to her, shows about 100 good
Blacks this, black that, black car, black flags
I really hope that's money that y'all got off in them black bags
808's and heartbreaks, states who puts in interstates
Giving me a bad vibe, guess I'm just a bad guy, ay
Throw yo' hands up in the air if you know he love ya
Tell the DJ play this song right here if you know he love ya
L-l-let me see you 2 step if you know he love ya
It don't matter if you're by yourself if you know he love ya
If you know he love you
Let me see you 2 step if you know he love ya
Don't matter if you're by yourself if you know he love ya
If that boy don't love you by now
He will never ever, never ever love you
He will never ever, never ever love you
If that boy don't love you by now
