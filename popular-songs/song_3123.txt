"This is a piece that I wrote, when I was on some
Low down, down low feelin' depressed shit
You know what I'm sayin'
It contains three suicide letters to my peeps
Oh, actually two suicide letters, you know what I'm sayin'
I wrote it in a rhyme form but I'm tryin' to read it
To the best of my abilities, you know what I'm sayin'
So bear with me, listen to the lyrics, check it out"
Picture me in a casket blasted
Never nobody knew how long the pain lasted
Keep my eyes tight, I'm frightened but I fights like Tyson
When playin' this game of life, I'm losin'
Longin' to be enlightened
Absorb my mind state, reduce the crime rate
And take me out, when runnin' toward the Lord
I see 'em fake me out shook me
So from church I play hookie
Listen to the words of a brother
The sick stutters so you better, better
Get the get the bags ready
Comes a killer, killer like Skagnetti
My brains contaminated, hella rotten
Wasn't me that killed you, who was it? What was it?
The effects of the mildew, my brain's wilted
In my eyes the world is a bit tilted
Lord, take me away before somebody else gets killed
Blood spilled, seriously
This is the letter to my homies, I'll be missin'
God told me to behold a pale horse but I didn't listen
It's hard man, my life is scarred man
I'm losin' my mind so now it's time, sincerely sign N9NE
(I just wanna die)
I don't wanna wake up
I don't wanna 'cuz
That's the way that I feel
I'm barely hangin' on
(I just wanna die)
I don't wanna wake up
I don't wanna 'cuz
That's the way it has to be
(I just wanna die)
I don't wanna wake up
I don't wanna 'cuz
That's the way that I feel
I'm barely hangin' on
(I just wanna die)
I don't wanna wake up
I don't wanna 'cuz
That's the way it has to be
I made your life a livin' Hell with my infidelity
Remember your tellin' me all I give a damn about
Is weed stems and melodies
Remember you spent 30 minutes in the hospital parkin' lot cryin'
When the blood test read the baby of another woman was mine 99.99
You should've left a long time ago like Mary J say
Just let it go like Ray J, can't
I know your mamma heard you yelling mayday
Spent my life tryin' to RA to the P
You sick of me always bein' B to the ROK to the E
Now there's nothin' else left of me
I was a bum but you still wanted some
Through the rain, snow and thunder
Foul ups, bleeps and blunders but no man shall tear asunder
Is what you said
You should've put multi bullets in my head
When you found that evil instinct was a song
Where the events actually went on
This is the letter to my homie, my friend
Who put up with me for 8 so now to take me
Really quickly is my fate, I'm sorry
For making it hard, I know your scarred
I'm losing my mind, so now it's time sincerely sign, N9ne
(I just wanna die)
I don't wanna wake up
I don't wanna 'cuz
That's the way that I feel
I'm barely hangin' on
(I just wanna die)
I don't wanna wake up
I don't wanna 'cuz
That's the way it has to be
(I just wanna die)
I don't wanna wake up
I don't wanna 'cuz
That's the way that I feel
I'm barely hangin' on
(I just wanna die)
I don't wanna wake up
I don't wanna 'cuz
That's the way it has to be
I love ya'll, the dynamic duo, my babies
It ain't your fault that your daddy's crazy
Donny, I miss your drummin' like me
One day you'll be rulin'
Leelee, I miss you in my face
Yellin', "Daddy, what you doin'?"
You two are the reason why I'm still standin' today
But I'm 1600 miles away and you get my heart sinkin'
When I start thinkin' about you babies, I heavily start drinkin'
On a daily puffin', I'm seeing my heart, I gots to toughin'
Can't see me leavin' my angels with nothin' so I keep bussin'
Use my pain for you two, I've gotta come up in the game
Fly palne to an island so one day you can do the same with yours
Love you galore and I ain't playin' makin' me put an end
To this suicidal mind state sayin'
(I just wanna die)
I don't wanna wake up
I don't wanna 'cuz
That's the way that I feel
I'm barely hangin' on
I don't wanna wake up
I don't wanna 'cuz
That's the way it has to be
I don't wanna wake up
I don't wanna 'cuz
That's the way that I feel
I'm barely hangin' on
I don't wanna wake up
I don't wanna 'cuz
That's the way it has to be
So we're just gonna sit back
Write these rhymes, make these bills
Chill, no more, Tech N9ne
