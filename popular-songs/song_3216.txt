[Bouncer:] Party night to night alright you can come on in
You're good skinny jeans come on in
Tight shirt come on in
Ah that new rock n roll gay look, yea you're cool come on in
[Tech:] What's up man?
[Bouncer:] Hey man you can't get in here boy
[Tech:] What's wrong with me man?
[Bouncer:] Well can't you read the sign boy?
[Tech:] No French braids, No dread locks, No gold teeth... gold teeth 
Aw you don't want no black folks in here huh?
[Bouncer:] Can't you read the sign? It says Power and White I mean Power and Light District
[Tech:] Look here man, how much it gonna take to turn this all white club into a nigga club?
[Chorus]
Let me in the door
If you say you hear me knockin what you standin there for
Who I gotta kill or sleep with
Cause I'm the world's best kept secret (Let me in)
Let me in the door
If you say you hear me knockin what you standin there for
Cause I'm the one that do that music
Ya feel but you still refuse this
Let me in the door
[Verse (Cash Image)]
Right now fore my goons have to tear it down
We don't wait in line and we don't stand around
We in clubs and we draggin actin brand new
Actin like he never seen my face and I ain't got loot
They know I'm Cash Image
And I'm with Tech N9ne
And fore the club close the owner gonna respect mine
We spend a lotta money and that's the bottom line
Ten cars on chrome plus the neck shine
Baggy jeans on and J's worth a lotta bucks
And you ain't gotta know me
You can tell my dollas up
Poppin collars in the club
Turn the bottles up
And all the models in the club wanna follow us
It's Mr. Chevy man
You hear my song playin
And every time we in the club we be spending grands
First deny Tech then deny me and I was No. 1 on 103 for 40 weeks
[Chorus]
Let me in the door
If you say you hear me knockin what you standin there for
Who I gotta kill or sleep with
Cause I'm the world's best kept secret (Let me in)
Let me in the door
If you say you hear me knockin what you standin there for
Cause I'm the one that do that music
Ya feel but you still refuse this
Let me in the door
[Verse (D-Loc)]
You say you hear me knockin so why you don't wanna let me in
But I ain't buggin so tell the cops to come and get me then
Complain about my shoes ain't really talking bout shit
Dude I spent like 350 on this outfit
NV ain't gon let me in
Seein as he actin funny with me
What it gonna cost me homie
I brought a little money with me
I don't wear tight shirts
My pants kinda baggy
KC hat tilted so now they wanna red flag me
I buy the bar every time
Point blank period
The doorman hate takin his job too serious
Me Cash Image with Tech and Kaliko
About big business so what I'm talking to a bouncer for
The women see me scream my name like the announcer spoke
They actin brand new this week so I'm about to go
To the block and bubble
And get plenty cake
I just wanted women and I don't like this club anyway
So fuck ya'll
[Chorus]
Let me in the door
If you say you hear me knockin what you standin there for
Who I gotta kill or sleep with
Cause I'm the world's best kept secret (Let me in)
Let me in the door
If you say you hear me knockin what you standin there for
Cause I'm the one that do that music
Ya feel but you still refuse this
Let me in the door
[Verse (Tech N9ne)]
I get money from music and I like to spend spend
And when I hit the town they gonna let me ins in
But these other clubs gonna be trippin like I begin sin
You hear me knockin? Aw yea well let me in then
Cause NV ain't so friendly 
They got a gay assembly of femmes 
Who think the blacks be packin semis
That's why they don't sell no Henny
Stink butts who think bucks 
But they don't know my bank account is like a Brinks truck
Could buy it any day
2.1 on a new building and lease
The N9ne has plenty say
The rhymin get me paid so I resign
Cause NV gay and plus NV stands for no vaginas anyway
They place me in lil weezy wee give no love
That's why when I bring Chingy in there and he peed in your club
Not in the toilet either (Nope)
You don't enjoy the beaver (Nope)
You'd rather plot on how to give a lil or the peter
America's clubbin phase two I erase you
My pants are too baggy even though I'm clean and I'm paid too
Orlando south races they treated me cold
And Lightening Strike and Power and Light won't let the Nina enter both 
Whoa guess my Dickies the wrong clothes
Play my music but won't let me and my homies through the doors
Over one million records sold
Lots of money to fold
They should let me in any club in KCMO
And I'm the biggest tipper
Bartenders know me well
And waitresses love me
So club owners go to hell
You got that goal to sell
But you want this bro to fail
When it really ain't me cause is your destiny to go to jail
And when you be serving you might see work
On Club Nina when you walk up you might be hurt
You might skee skirt
Cause you ain't getting in if you ain't got a KC hat and a white t-shirt (HEY!)
[Chorus]
Let me in the door
If you say you hear me knockin what you standin there for
Who I gotta kill or sleep with
Cause I'm the world's best kept secret (Let me in)
Let me in the door
If you say you hear me knockin what you standin there for
Cause I'm the one that do that music
Ya feel but you still refuse this
Let me in the door
[Tech:]
Only reason I even go to the club is so I can listen to some loud music
And drink holler at a Bianc
My neighbors be mad at me cause I be shakin the whole block with my system
So that's why I go to the club
I gotta work at the club
Take pictures and sign autographs
Ya know what I mean
I don't need to be in your club for real
And club dollars say I owe 'em 70 dollars I paid 125 dollars to get in
Why you trippin I just wanted to drink
So if 70 dollars is owed that means some cats were there after I left
Ya know what I mean ha ha put it on my tab
