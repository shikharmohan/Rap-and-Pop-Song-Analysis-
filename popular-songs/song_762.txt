Hi, to the haters, I'll see you later
Please don't step on da gators
Do me a favor, just keep waitin' on me
Okay now, 5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1
We, we got rhythm, y'all, y'all got none
Say you, say you lookin' for somebody
Out there in the sun, drivin', grindin' like me
You're worse shawty, I'm the one
I, I owe you, naw you owe me
Y'all pop champagne, that's my breed
Tryin' ta get my bills up like John Seed
So girl you know, I, I'm not free
No one ever thought up in the street that I can hold it down
Talkin' that shit while I bringin' dat heat and now I own the town
Even with all this weight on me it couldn't bring me down
Only they keep hatin' on me
So I can wave, hi, to the haters, I'll see you later
Please don't step on da gators
Do me a favor, just keep waitin' on me
5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1
We, we takin' over, fee fi fo fum
You know I know I got the city bangin', fangin' out da drums
The strength that I been drinkin' got me feelin' kinda shh, uhh
I'm tipsy, y'all missed me
And it ain't 'cause I been around the world like Disney
Really, really, straight from the illy
Ain't no body stop me now
No one ever thought up in the street that I can hold it down
Talkin' that shit while I bringin' dat heat and now I own the town
Even with all this weight on me it couldn't bring me down
Only they keep hatin' on me
So I can wave, hi, to the haters, I'll see you later
Please don't step on da gators
Do me a favor, just keep waitin' on me
Hey, there baby girl, you shockin' me
Your bass in my trunk, that's knockin' me
Anywhere you go they watchin' me
'Cause I fly as a bird, they flockin' me
You got no property and I got monopoly
And I can stack it up, she can back it up
And nobody in the streets is stoppin' me
See the shoes on the whip
Or the chrome on the lip, they, hey
Or maybe it's the glare from the lice on the kit
Or the ice on they wrist they stare
Shit, listen I ain't get the manager but I don't see why they, hey
Can you see why they, hey, I ain't gon' lie
They make you wanna run an tell somebody
No one ever thought up in the street that I can hold it down
Talkin' that shit while I bringin' dat heat and now I own the town
Even with all this weight on me it couldn't bring me down
Only they keep hatin' on me
So I can wave hi, to the haters, I'll see you later
Please don't step on da gators
Do me a favor, just keep waitin' on me
On me, on me, on me, on me
On me, on me, yeah, oh
