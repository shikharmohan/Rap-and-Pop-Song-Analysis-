Here's how it goes
Boy meets girl, girl leaves boy 
That's all i know
All I've done 
All my life
Cause throughout my history 
Of only being with jerks
Who couldn't take it 
But you see the picket fence				
The swing on the front porch 
With us two on it 
When I believe  
That nothing last forever
You stay with me 
Keeping us together
And make me feel 
Like i never ever want to give you up 
till now 
I've always been a quitter
You rescued me 
Saved my life
Just in time
Saw past all my 
issues and scars
And made me try 
Cause ohh the way your kissing me 
Makes it hard to breath 
But i still like it 
Ohh ohh it should it feels like a dream 
You know exactly 
How i want it
 
When I believe 
That nothing last forever
Stay with me 
Keeping us together
And make me feel 
Like i never ever want to give you up 
till now 
I've always been a quitter
I've always been a quitter
When i believe that nothing last forever
Stay with me 
Keeping us together
And make me feel 
Like i never ever want to give you up 
till no 
I've always been a quitter
I've always been a quitter
