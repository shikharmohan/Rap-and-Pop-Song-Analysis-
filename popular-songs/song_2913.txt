My cousin's gettin' married at the Methodist Church
That's why I stayed home from work
I'm supposed to hold the flowers
When the new bride kisses the groom
That's what I'm supposed to do
So what are we doin' with the windows rolled down
Twenty five passionate miles from town
Oh, I love her like a sister, baby but to tell you the truth
I'd rather ride around with you
The guy she's gonna marry has got money to burn
His daddy's a partner in some big law firm
Yeah, that's how they're goin'
To Hawaii on their honeymoon
First class to Honolulu
She's never even set foot on a jet
I'm a little bit jealous I confess
I'd like to fly to Hawaii
But honey if I had to choose
Oh, I'd rather ride around with you
I don't care where this road goes
No, I don't wanna turn around
Let go of the wheel, feel the wind blow
Don't even think about slowin' down
They're tyin' tin cans to the back of the car
Wonderin' where in the world we are
The preacher's done prayin'
And the couple's done sayin' I do
That could be me and you
There's way too many decisions to make
The length of the dress
The layers on the cake
Oh, one of these days I might get married too
But I'd rather ride around with you
I don't care where this road goes
No, I don't wanna turn around
Let go of the wheel, feel the wind blow
Don't even think about slowin' down
'Cause I'd rather ride around with you
Oh, I'd rather ride around with you
