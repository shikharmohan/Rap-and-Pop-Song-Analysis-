when i think abour my life 
                i wonder if i will survive
		      live to see 25
                   or will i just fall?
                   like all my friends
                  they just keep dying
                    people around me
                     always crying
              in this place that i like to 
                      call my home 
                but not everybody knows
                 that everybody goes
                  to a better place
                and not everybody knows
                    that everybody  
            could be living their last days
             but the hard times will come
               and we'll keep moving on
                   we're moving on
                   keep movin' on

               trustÃÂ¡prideÃÂ¡ loveÃÂ¡ lustÃÂ¡
           on whitout the things we've lost
                the things we've gained
                  we'll take whit us
        and all i've got are these two hands
             to make myself a better man
      wonder if i 'll ever see the end of this
                  whit all this rain
                if just keeps falling
                      on my head 
                 and now i'm calling
                 out to someone else
             to help me make it through
              but not everybody knows
       that everybody goes to a better place
              and not everybody knows
     that they could be living their last days
           but the hard times will come
             and we'll keep movin' on
                 we're moving on
                 KEEP MOVIN' ONÃÂ¡
