Y'all know what this is
This is what you need to do girl
Let me hold you
I been watching you for a minute
Come through here so sweet scented
In life girl you need me in it
I'm determined to win it
I know what you need
I know what's wrong
I know how to make it tight
Everything'll be all right
If ya let me hold you
And introduce you to my world
And introduce you to the better side of life
That you ain't been seein' girl
I'ma show you where it's at
And I'ma show you how to get it
All you got do is be wit it
And let me hold you
Down like a real man's supposed to
I never would have approached you
If I ain't have intentions on doing good
See dude you wit is so fooled
To me girl you're so cool
And all I'm asking you to do is
Let me hold you
Down like a best friend and two homies in the game
When you cry I wanna feel your pain
No secrets, no games
All excitement, nothing plain
Keep you happy that's my aim
And all you gotta do girl is
Let me hold you
In my arms, in my mind, all the time
I wanna keep you right by my side
'Till I die I'm gonna hold you down
And make sure everything is right wit you
You can never go wrong if you
Let me hold you
Down like a real friend's supposed to
I'm trying to show you the life
That somebody like you should be living
Oh baby baby, you could never go wrong, never
If you let me hold you
I'ma keep you up on what's poppin'
And shake you fresh to death
When we hit the mall we can ball
'Till there's no mo' left
I know you ain't used to it
But you gon' get used to it
'Cause that's the only way I'ma do it
And let me hold you
All the homies think I'm trippin'
'Cause I got you a pad
But see, they just mad
'Cause they ain't get you, they ain't get you
Scorpio is your sign
And girl you're so fine
And I would do whatever in no time, no shine
(Let me hold you)
It's what you're coming with
But I'ma change all that
Rearrange that
Put you in the Range all black
With the rims to match, phone attached
TV's in the back
How you gon' say no to that, huh?
Let me hold you
Niggas look at me like, "Man, here you go
Really 'bout to blow some dough
But ain't nobody did it before
So why is you so gung ho?"
'Cause I believe
This was meant to be
I just gotta work at it
Like a crack addict up in rehab
In my arms, in my mind, all the time
I wanna keep you right by my side
'Till I die I'm gonna hold you down
And make sure everything is right wit you
You can never go wrong if you
Let me hold you
Down like a real friend's supposed to
I'm trying to show you the life
That somebody like you should be living
Oh baby baby, you could never go wrong
If you let me hold you
Down down around
Atlanta 'lanta, far found
And everybody know now
What I'm tryna do, I say
Down down around
Atlanta 'lanta, far found
I'm just tryna get you to
Let me hold you
Down down around
Atlanta 'lanta, far found
And everybody know now
What I'm tryna do, I say
Down down around
Atlanta 'lanta, far found
I'm just tryna get you to
Let me hold you
In my arms, in my mind, all the time
I wanna keep you right by my side
'Till I die I'm gonna hold you down
And make sure everything is right wit you
You can never go wrong if you
Let me hold you
Down like a real friend's supposed to
I'm trying to show you the life
That somebody like you should be living
Oh baby baby, you could never go wrong
If you let me hold you
