Staring deep into your eyes
Searching for answers to questions I can't find
If I took for granted that I held your heart
I'd beg forgiveness but I don't know where to start
Draw me a map that leads me back to you
I don't know where to go, please tell me what to do
Help me find the road you're on
I just need directions home
Draw me a map that leads me back to you
I've never been so at loss
I'm at a canyon I can't get around or cross
So baby come down here, lay by my side
And tell me love's not lost across the great divide
Draw me a map that leads me back to you
I don't know where to go, please tell me what to do
Help me find the road you're on
I just need directions home
Draw me a map that leads me back to you
You're my destiny and destination
Understand my desperation - you
The only place I wanna be
So get us back to you and me
Draw me a map that leads me back to you
I don't know where to go, please tell me what to do
Help me find the road you're on
I just need directions home
Draw me a map that leads me back to you
