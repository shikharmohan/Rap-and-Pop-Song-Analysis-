[Verse 1]
Get out the wayy
Cici comin' thru
30 inches on my jeep
Still I ride it like a 'coup
I ain't got nothing to prove
This is what I do
They think I'm in the game when they see the bottom of my shoe
(louis vuitton)
And that's just how I play
And you can find me on the stage (all day)
Don't you know (I go hard)
Givenchy on my shades
I'm the girl around the way
Still the princess of the A (hey)
[Chorus]
This right here is my (swag)
All the boys all on me, (damn)
Ev.erybo.dy pay. attention
This right here is my (pretty girl swag (ayeee) (4x))
Boys on my shit when I pretty girl swag
Boys love my shit when (I pretty girl swag (4x))
Boys on my shit when I pretty girl swag
Boys love my shit when I pretty girl swag
