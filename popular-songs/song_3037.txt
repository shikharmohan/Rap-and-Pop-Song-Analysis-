I'm lovin' you, baby, lovin' me
Lovin' you, lovin' me
And I'm inclined just to let it be, let it be
I'm a lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' me
Well, I'm lovin' you, baby, lovin' me
Lovin' you, lovin' me
And I'm inclined just to let it be, let it be
I'm a lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' me
Once was living life alone
Once was living but the life was gone
Once my life was just a bad routine
When you're doing it by yourself
Life's such a lonely thing
And I'm lovin' you, baby, lovin' me
Lovin' you, lovin' me
And I'm inclined just to let it be, let it be
I'm a lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' me
Well, I'm lovin' you, baby, lovin' me
Lovin' you, lovin' me
And I'm inclined just to let it be, let it be
I'm a lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' me
Well, I'm lovin' you, baby, lovin' me
Lovin' you, lovin' me
And I'm inclined just to let it be, let it be
I'm a lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' me
