In a diner down on Broadway they make small talk
When she brings his eggs and fills his coffee cup
He jokes about his love life and tells her he's about ready to give up
That's when she says,"I've been there before but keep on lookin'
'Cause maybe who you're lookin' for is"
"Somebody in the next car, somebody on the mornin' train
Somebody in the coffee shop that you walk right by every day
Somebody that you look at but never really see
Somewhere out there, there's somebody"
Across town in a crowded elevator
He can't forget the things that waitress said
He usually reads the paper
But today he reads a stranger's face instead
It's that blue-eyed girl from two floors up
Maybe she's the one maybe he could fall in love with
Somebody in the next car, somebody on the mornin' train
Somebody in the coffee shop that you walk right by every day
Somebody that you look at but never really see
Somewhere out there, there's somebody
Now they laugh about the moment that it happened
A moment they both missed until that day
When he saw his future in her eyes instead of just another friendly face
And he wonders why he searched so long
When she was always there at that diner waitin' on
Somebody in the next car, somebody on the mornin' train
Somebody in the coffee shop that you walk right by every day
Somebody that you look at but never really see
Somewhere out there, oh somewhere out there is somebody
