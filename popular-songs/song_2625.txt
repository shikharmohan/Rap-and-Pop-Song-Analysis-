Do you know where your heart is,
do you think you can find it,
or did you trade it for something, somewhere,
better just to have it,
do you know where your love is, 
do you think that you've lost it, 
you found it so strong but nothings. turned out how you want it, 
Well bless my soul, 
you loved me soul,
 cause you wont let go of anything you hold
well all i need, is the air i breath and a place to rest my head. 
do you know what your fate is,
now your trying to shake it, 
your doing your best dance, 
your best look and your praying that you'll make it, 
well bless my soul, you loved me soul cause you wont let go of anything you hold 
well all i need, is the air i breath and a place to rest my head said all i need is the air i breath and a place to rest my head
do you think you can find it, do you think you can find it, do you think you can find it, better than you have been, do you think you can find it, do you think you can find it, do you think you can find it, better than you have been (better than you have been ) 
said all i need is the air i breath and a place to rest my head said all i need is the air i breath and a place to rest my head,
Do you know where the end is, 
do you think you can see it, 
well until you get there, 
well go on, 
go ahead and scram it,
just say,
