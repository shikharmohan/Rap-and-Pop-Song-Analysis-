The first time I laid my eyes on you I knew
We'd spend this life side by side
I still feel the same though you're so far away
I swear that you'll always be my
Forever love, I promise you
Someday we'll be together, forever love
I won't give up no matter what
I'll be waiting for you, forever love
Minutes and hours and years may go by
But my heart knows nothing of time
So don't cry just keep me right there in your dreams
And hold on to these words of mine
Forever love, I promise you
Someday we'll be together, forever love
I won't give up no matter what
I'll be waiting for you, forever love
Love is the road to our destiny
Nothing can change
What is meant to be, forever love
Oh, I won't give up no matter what
I'll be waiting for you, forever love
I'll be waiting for you, forever love
Forever love
