Real cocky
Real sloppy
Drunk at the club and y'all can't stop me
Super star style
Whoop the are pounds
Out the roof, scoop the group we be troopin' large crowds
Yes we are foul and we rich now
Used to be all of me, but it's all on the bitch now
They wanna get me stuck, they comin' into my world
It's too late I got my wife, my bitch, my girl
I was nineteen, met a nice queen
Car was light green, naughty as ice cream
But she too jealous nickaleas
Sort of ridiculous with the liffa kickin' it
We can never be inconspicuous, my bitch
Rolls with me, it's so sickly in love with me
But she give me Felicia 'ol hickeys
But go get me in the wee hours to get me slow quickies
So sticky, roll with my homies she so shifty, my wife
Married a monsta, carried a youngsta
Said if you cheated, it will come back to hunt ya
She said my filthy world, makes her wanna hurl
And that's my first verse, my wife, my bitch, my girl
Daddy told me that she wanna control the chick
She gotta go blow her grip
Because it's all on a bitch
One is no trip but two had just mo lip
But three I can't cope with
My wife, my bitch, my girl
Daddy told me that she wanna control the chick
She gotta go and blow her grip
Because it's all on a bitch
One is no trip, but two had just mo lip
But three I just can't cope with
My wife, my bitch, my girl
Got a nice anus and it's right, ain't it?
Can't really touch it durin' the day but in the night, tame it
Usin' fight language when she take inches
Great bitches gettin' busy on the weight benches, my bitch
Got a big butt, a big slut who get bucks
You might look up and get your chick sucked
'Cause she's bi sex, keep her thighs wet
Spontaneous I don't know what we gonna try next, my wife
Go a ghetto booty like Naomi, I'ma tell you like Jayo say
All my bitches havin' fancy dreams
And all my bitches wearin' apple bottom jeans
My wife, my bitch, my girl
Daddy told me that she wanna control the chick
She gotta go blow her grip
Because it's all on a bitch
One is no trip but two had just mo lip
But three I can't cope with
My wife, my bitch, my girl
Daddy told me that she wanna control the chick
She gotta go blow her grip
Because it's all on a bitch
One is no trip but two had just mo lip
But three I can't cope with
My wife, my bitch, my girl
If one's trippin', the other's for fun flippin', you coo
She run's limpin', you end up with funds missin', you foo
Come wicked your women become vicious and cruel
Dump checkin' to [Incomprehensible] with some check's and you lose
Out of balance the playalistical values and lyin'
I done challenged the way of mystical powers and [Incomprehensible]
I can silence an egotistical chick in a fight
I'm defiant with an evil twist my girl, my bitch and my wife
Ain't no bitch on this planet that is a match for me
They get sick and they stand it 'cause Nina packs the three
Have to be, crash to see if natural cause a catastrophe
Exactaly, my wife don't like me, my bitch get's hyphy, my girl
Might knife me twice just to spite me, my wife
If I break her heart, my bitch
It'll rip her apart, my girl
But I'm the smarter y'all, my wife, my bitch, my girl
Daddy told me that she wanna control the chick
She gotta go blow her grip
Because it's all on a bitch
One is no trip but two had just mo lip
But three I can't cope with
My wife, my bitch, my girl
Daddy told me that she wanna control the chick
She gotta go blow her grip
Because it's all on a bitch
One is no trip but two had just mo lip
But three I can't cope with
My wife, my bitch, my girl
Daddy told me that she wanna control the chick
She gotta go blow her grip
Because it's all on a bitch
One is no trip but two had just mo lip
But three I can't cope with
My wife, my bitch, my girl
Daddy told me that she wanna control the chick
She gotta go blow her grip
Because it's all on a bitch
One is no trip but two had just mo lip
But three I can't cope with
My wife, my bitch, my girl
