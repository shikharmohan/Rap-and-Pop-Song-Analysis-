This is my one chord song
It's easy to sing along
'Cause there ain't much in the way it change
Sometimes life can be that way
Yeah, there ain't too much I can do with a melody
'Cause I'm stuck in the confines of the single key of G
This is my one chord song
I can't go on too long
'Cause I've said all I've got to say
And you probably won't hear this anyway
Yeah, now here's the same thing you've heard 8 bars before
'Cause just like me I'm sure your bored with this chord
If I can make you stop and think
About the life you're living in
'Cause you and I don't have long
So make the most before it's gone
This is my one chord song
I can make it sound like it's another chord
And you'd be fool because it's only one
This is my one chord song, this is my one chord song
This is my one chord song
