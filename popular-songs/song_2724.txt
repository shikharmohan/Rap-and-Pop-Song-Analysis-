You've been treating me like a candle
You put me out and light me as you please
But I ain't never gonna be your handle
So you can hold me and hurt me when you squeeze
And bring me to my knees
I got over you long ago
And I ain't under your spell no more
I've been round here too long
I've been over and under around and now I'm gone
You carried me away with your blue eyes
Now I'm heading back for those blue skies
You cut me way too hard and way too deep
You're looking at what a fool used to be
Take a look at me
I got over you long ago
And I ain't under your spell no more
I've been around here too long
I've been over and under around and now I'm gone
Well, I got over you long ago
And I ain't under your spell no more
I've been around here too long
I've been over and under around and now I'm gone
I got over you long ago
And I ain't under your spell no more
I've been around here too long
I've been over and under around and now I'm gone
