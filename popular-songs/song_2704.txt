I'd like to tell you all just a little bit about my background. I grew up
in the Southeastern part of Oklahoma. In a little, bitty town called
Chockie. It was little, it only had 18 people it. That's 18 people, not
1,800. We're talkin' small. In that town in Southeastern Oklahoma, we had
a lot of fun growin' up, us kids. There was 3 things that my mama and
daddy always taught us. Number one, they taught us to work hard. Number
two, they told us, if you ever start a job - you finish it. And number
three, they said once you start that job you give it 110% of everything
you have. And we did. Not only is my daddy a hard workin' man, but my mama
is a hard workin' woman. And that's what she instilled in us three girls,
was to be hard workin' women. Now that's not to say we didn't have a lot
of fun, 'cause we did. Why, I can remember gettin' in that closet. Puttin'
on them high-heeled shoe
And I wanna dedicate it to all the hard-workin' women with us tonight!
Tumble outta bed and I stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
And yawn and stretch and try to come to life
I jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the street the traffic starts jumpin'
For folks like me on the job from 9 to 5
Workin' 9 to 5
What a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by
It's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind
And they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you
Crazy if you let it
9 to 5 for service and devotion
You would think that I
Would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead
But the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is
Out to get me
Well, they let you dream just to watch 'em shatter
You're just a step on the boss man's ladder
But you've got dreams he'll never take away
Well you're in the same boat with a lot of your friends
Waitin' for the day, the ship to come in
And the tide's gonna turn and it's all gonna roll your way
Workin' 9 to 5
What a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by
It's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind
And they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you
Crazy if you let it
9 to 5 for service and devotion
You would think that I
Would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead
But the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is
Out to get me
9 to 5, they got you where they want you
There's a better life
And you think about it don't ya
It's a rich man's game
No matter what they call it
And you'll spend your life
Puttin' money in his wallet

Crazy if you let it
