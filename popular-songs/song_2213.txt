Polly wants a cracker
I think I should get off her first
Maybe think she wants some water
To put out the blow torch
It isn't me we have some seed
Let me clip your dirty wings
Let me take a ride don't hurt yourself
I want some help to please myself
I've got some rope haven't told
I promise you I have been true
Let me take a ride don't hurt yourself
I want some help to please myself
Polly wants a cracker
Maybe she would like more food
She asks me to untie her
A chase would be nice for a few
It isn't me we have some seed
Let me clip your dirty wings
Let me take a ride don't hurt yourself
I want some help to please myself
I've got some rope haven't told
I promise you I have been true
Let me take a ride don't hurt yourself
I want some help to please myself
Polly said
Polly says her back hurts
And she's just as bored as me
She caught me off my guard
It amazes me the will of instinct
It isn't me we have some seed
Let me clip your dirty wings
Let me take a ride don't hurt yourself
I want some help to please myself
I've got some rope haven't told
I promise you I have been true
Let me take a ride, don't hurt yourself
I want some help to please myself
