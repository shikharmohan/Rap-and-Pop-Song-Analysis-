Excuse me for this, I just want a kiss
I just wanna know what it feels like to touch
Something so pure, something I'm so sure of
What it feels like to stand outside your door
I'm unworthy, I can see you're above me
But I can be lovely given the chance
Don't move
I wanna remember you just like this
Don't move
It's only a breath or two between our lips
I know why you left, I can't blame you myself
Must be hard living with ghosts and such an empty shell
I tried to warn you, I've been a mess since you've known me
I can't promise forever but I'm working on it
If I can't hold you
Can I give you a kiss?
Can I have a kiss?
I see that you're torn
I've got some scars of my own
Seems I want what I know
Is gonna leave me hungry
Don't move
I need to remember you just like this
I know why you left, I can't blame you myself
Must be hard living with ghosts and such an empty shell
I tried to warn you, I've been a mess since you've known me
I can't promise forever but I'm working on it
If I can't hold you
Can I give you a kiss? Can I?
All I have, all I can give to you I will
Just promise this
If I can't have forever
Can I have a kiss? Kiss, kiss
No, I know why you left, I can't blame you myself
Must be hard living with ghosts and such an empty shell
I tried to warn you, I've been a mess since you've known me
I can't promise forever but I'm working on it
If I can't hold you
Can I give you a kiss?
Can I give you a kiss?
Can I? Can I?
Can I have a kiss?
