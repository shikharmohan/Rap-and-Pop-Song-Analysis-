"Like My Dog"
He never tells me that he's sick of this house
He never says why dont you get off that couch?
He dont cause me nothin when he wants to go out
I want you to love me like my dog
He never says I need a new attitude
Him and my sister aint always in a feud
When I leave the seat up he dont think that its rude
I want you to love me like my dog does Baby!
When I come home, I want you to just go crazy
He never looks at me like he might hate me
I want you to love me like my dog
He never acts like he dont care for my friends
He never asks me where in the hell have you been?
He dont play dead when I wanna pet him
I want you to love me like my dog does honey!
He never says 'I wish you made more money'
He always takes it for my fingers funny
I want you to love me like my dog
He dont get mad at me and throw a major fit
When I say his sister is a b**ch!
I want you to love me like my dog does baby
When I come home, I want you to just go crazy
He never looks at me like he might hate me
I want you to love me like my dog!
I want you to love me like my dog does Baby!
