I believe that love and trust are one and the same
I don't think you can truly love somebody unless you trust 'em
That blind trust, that beyond a shadow of a doubt
No matter what this person sayin', that person, you believe your man
Now you say you love me but every time one of your little friends
Come at you with something, we gotta do this
Mama, I'm tryin', I'm tryin' to show you that I'm for real
Tell me what I gotta do to show you that I'm for you
Just shut up and listen
Two hundred and sixteen
That's how many times that I went
Back and forth about it in my mind
Could she, could she really be
Who he's telling me that she is?
There's something about it that don't feel right
Saturday she called here 26 times
(Oh you counted)
You kept telling me not to worry
(Don't worry 'bout it)
Wanna believe that you're telling the truth
(So don't doubt it)
But if you are lying to me
You're leaving tonight, out of my life
Everyone said you ain't no good, then you prove them right
You're leaving tonight, it's over and done
Ain't no sense in trying to wait 'til the morning comes
(You're leaving tonight)
Baby, now hold up, let's just settle down
'Cause there's a perfect explanation
To this situation that we're goin' through
(This thing that we're goin' through)
I swear I don't know that girl but I seen her 'round
And she's expressed how much she want it
But baby, I'm not lonely, all of me is for all of you
Said, I got a girl like a thousand times
(So you counted)
She kept telling me not to worry
(Don't worry 'bout it)
Please believe I'm telling the truth
(I really doubt it)
Really wish you would believe in me
I'm not leaving tonight, girl, you're my life
All of your friends think I'm no good, please don't prove 'em right
I'm not leaving tonight, it's over and done
Let's leave this alone and let's make love 'til the morning come
(Not leaving tonight)
Oh, I won't deny that everything in my body
Wants to know that you're the one
(So what's the problem, girl?)
See I can't take this serious when you're just having fun
(Oh, I'm not just having fun)
Steady, running around, making a fool of me
  (I'm not running 'round)
Baby girl, you can't listen to everyone
I'm your man, trust in me
  (You're my man, uh huh)
Don't let them interfere with us being happy
Love me, girl
I love you, that's a fact
(Say that you love me, baby)
But I'll be damned if I'ma let you
Up and disrespect who's been there from the start
(You not gon' disrespect my heart)
You claim, claim to not know
(Not know that girl)
But her name and number is in your phone
She even got a ringtone
You care to explain that part?
Saturday she called here 26 times
(I know you counted)
You kept telling me not to worry
(Please don't worry 'bout it)
Wanna believe that you're telling the truth
(So don't doubt it)
But if you are lying to me
I'm not leaving tonight
(Leaving tonight)
Girl, you're my life
(Out of my life)
Everyone said you ain't no good
And you prove them right
I'm not leaving tonight
It's over and done
Just leave this alone
And let's make love 'til the morning come
(Not leaving tonight)
Said, I just need you to trust me, baby
(I wanna trust you)
Not leaving tonight
