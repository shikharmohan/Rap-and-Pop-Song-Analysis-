The city of angels is lonely at night
Keep myself alight by candlelight
So she can love you like I do
Look me in the eyes and say it's true
I ask myself is this love at all?
When I need you most you let me fall
I'm always here at the side of your stage
Let you live your life, pretend I'm okay
Don't you know that this is wrong?
I'll be okay
I'll hold you close, you'll stay forever
I, I don't understand
Why you're leaving me
I, I don't understand
How without you I can't breathe
Please don't, don't leave me here
Take my hand and breathe in deep
I don't understand
Why you can't take me with you
You can pretend I don't exist
But you will see my face every time you kiss
I hope you heard any walls fall down
When you hear the sound that I'm okay
Don't you know that this is wrong?
I'll be okay
You can't hold me down, I will stay forever
I, I don't understand
Why you're leaving me
I, I don't understand
How without you I can't breathe
Please don't, don't leave me here
Take my hand and breathe in deep
I don't understand
Why you can't take me with you
I watched you leave, I'm awake tonight
And I'm letting go for the last time
And through the tears I say goodbye
So breathe in, breathe in, breathe in, breathe out
I, I don't understand
Why you're leaving me
I, I don't understand
How without you I can't breathe
Please don't, don't leave me here
Take my hand and breathe in deep
I don't understand
Why you can't take me with you
I don't understand
Why you're leaving me
I, I don't understand
How without you I can't breathe
Please don't, don't leave me here
Take my hand and breathe in deep
I don't understand
Why can't take me with you
