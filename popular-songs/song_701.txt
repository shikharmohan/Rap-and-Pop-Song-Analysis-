I can't wait, wanna see
How this night is gonna be
Just a touch away
From the feelin' that is here to stay
We can make it last forever, baby
Our love will stand the test of time
(Get up)
In the middle of our world
I'll be waitin' for you to be all mine
(Get up)
We're walkin' on sunshine
In the middle of the night
And it feels like I'm somewhere
Above the sky
I, I, I
Take my hand, close your eyes
Say the sweet little things that make me cry
Catch my tears, with a kiss
These special moments do exist
We can make it last forever, baby
Our love will stand the test of time
(Get up)
In the middle of our world
I'll be waitin' for you to be all mine
(Get up)
We're walkin' on sunshine
In the middle of the night
And it feels like I'm somewhere
Above the sky
I, I, I
Let's take a chance
And try love, baby
No I'm not givin' up
Till you tell me
That you'll be in my life
Until the end of time
(Get up)
(Get up)
We're walkin' on sunshine
In the middle of the night
And it feels like I'm somewhere
Above the sky
I, I, I
Let's take a chance
And try love, baby
  (Try love)
No I'm not givin' up
Till you tell me
  (Till you)
That you'll be in my life
  (That you)
Until the end of time
Get up, get up, get up, get up
  (Oh aah, ooh aah)
Get up, get up, get up, get up
  (Oh aah, ooh aah, ooh aah, ooh aah)
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
We're walkin' on sunshine
  (Walkin' on sunshine)
In the middle of the night
  (Middle of the night, yea)
And it feels like I'm somewhere
Above the sky
  (Sky)
I, I, I
We're walkin' on sunshine
  (Walkin' on sunshine)
In the middle of the night
  (Middle of the night)
And it feels like I'm somewhere
Above the sky
  (The sky, so high, so high)
I, I, I
We're walkin' on sunshine
  (Yea, yea)
In the middle of the night
  (Yea, yea)
And it feels like I'm somewhere
  (Somewhere)
Above the sky
  (The sky)
I, I, I
We're walking on sunshine
  (Yea, yea)
In the middle of the night
  (Yea, yea)
And it feels like I'm somewhere
  (Yea, yea)
Above the sky, high
  (Yea)
I, I, I
  (Yea)
