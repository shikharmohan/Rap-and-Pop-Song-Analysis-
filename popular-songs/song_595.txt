uh uh oh ahhhhhhh radio killa
Taking back my love (x5)
You said you changed,
But still nothing.
You're still the same,
I'm just a part time lover.
And I'm the blame,
Should've went away.
But yet I stayed,
With a part time lover.
See, somedays you will love me.
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't.
Then you're here, then you're gone.
I'm alone.
Now you got me stressing out
On the phone.
But it's the last time, I'm movin' on,
I'm throwing on my Louboutins.
I'm throwing on my Louboutins (x9)
I left the state,
Changed everything.
No more (818)
For the part time lover.
What goes around,
comes back around.
And then you get what you deserve.
You part time lover.
See, somedays you will love me.
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't.
Then you're here, then you're gone.
I'm alone.
Now you got me stressing out
On the phone.
But it's the last time, I'm movin' on,
I'm throwing on my Louboutins.
I'm throwing on my Louboutins (x8)
Watch these Red bottoms,
And the back of my jeans.
Watch me go, bye baby.
Don't know what you got until it's gone.
Tail Lights is all you'll see
Watch this Benz exit
That driveway.
I'm throwing on my Louboutins (eh hey eh) (x8)
Watch me walk it out,
Walk it out, walk it out.
Walk this right up
out the house. 
Walk it out watch me walk it out
walk it out walk this right up out the house
I'm throwin on my Louboutins (out the house) (x8)
