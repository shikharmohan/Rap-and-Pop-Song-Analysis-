My grandmama was a wise old soul
Took me by the hand not long ago
Said, "Son, what's your hurry, boy slow it down
Taste the wild honey, listen to the sound of the
Wind that's blowin' through the trees
River is flowin' to the sea
Yeah they're all headin' home just like you and me
Life's for livin' child, can't you see there?"
If these are the days we will remember
And these are the times that won't come again, hmm
The highest of flames becomes an ember
And you gotta live 'em while you can
And these are the days we will remember
These are the days we will remember
These are the days we will remember
  (Ooo ooh)
An' these are the days we will remember
  (Ooo ooh)
  (Ooo ooh)
So take 'em by the hand, they're yours and mine
  (Take 'em by the hand, ooh)
Take 'em by the hand and live your life
Take 'em by the hand don't let 'em all fly by
  (Take 'em by the hand, ohh)
C'mon, C'mon now
  (Ooo ooh)
Ooo days go by
  (Ooo ooh)
Yeah, just like a hand out the window
  (Ooo ooh)
Wavin' in the wind as the cars go by
  (Ooo ooh)
Days go by
Ooo ooh, ooo ooh
Oo ooh, aah ooh
