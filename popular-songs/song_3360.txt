1, 2, 3, like a bird I sing
'Cause you've given me the most beautiful set of wings
And I'm so glad you're here today
'Cause tomorrow I might have to go and fly away, hey!
I'm down to my last dollar, I've walked right though my shoes
Just a small reminder of the hell that I've gone through
But look at me still smiling as I'm wondering what I'll do
Since I ain't got nothing I got nothing to lose
Everybody say, "Ha ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha"
Well my friends are always giving me watches, hats and wine
That's how I know this is serious, that's how I know it's time
I don't have to worry about things that I don't have
'Cause if I ain't got nothing I got nothing to hold me back
And 1, 2, 3, like a bird I sing
'Cause you've given me the most beautiful set of wings
And I'm so glad you're here today
'Cause tomorrow I might have to go and fly away
Fly away, fly away
Fly away, fly away
There's nothing that's worth keeping me from places I should go
From Happyville to Lovingland I'm gonna tour from coast to coast
I'm leaving everything behind, there's not much that I need
'Cause if I ain't got nothing I'm footloose and fancy free
And 1, 2, 3, like a bird I sing
'Cause you've given me the most beautiful set of wings
And I'm so glad you're here today
'Cause tomorrow I might have to go and fly away
Fly away, fly away
Fly away, fly away
Look at me so free, nothing's holding me down
Look at me so free, can't keep my feet on the ground
And 1, 2, 3, like a bird I sing
'Cause you've given me the most beautiful set of wings
And I'm so glad you're here today
'Cause tomorrow I might have to go and
1, 2, 3, like a bird I sing
'Cause you've given me the most beautiful set of wings
And I'm so glad you're here today
'Cause tomorrow I might have to go and fly away
Fly away, fly away
Fly away, fly away
Fly away, fly away
1, 2, 3, like a bird I sing
