Boy I never knew I could feel
The way I felt, when I felt
They way you were feelin' me baby
I'm so out of control, yeah
Every time you look my way
I realize more and more
How much I adore those pretty eyes of yours
I'm helpless baby
What I want to know is
Are you willing to try
Can you love me for a lifetime
In just one night, ohh
Baby I love you
Baby I need you
I gotta have you
Can't be without you
Baby I love you
Baby I need you
I gotta have you
Can't be without you
Blessed and cursed on the same day
The day that I first felt the power of you
Inside of me
Such a strong feeling
There comes a time in everyones life
When you know that everyone around you knows
That everything has changed, you're not the same
It's a new day
Oh, what I wanna know is
Are you willing to try
Try to be more meaning to this
Than what meets the eye
Baby I love you
Baby I need you
I gotta have you
Can't be without you
Baby I love you
Baby I need you
I gotta have you
Can't be without you
Ohh, I love the way you kiss me
Baby please
I'm about to lose my mind
Ohh, talk to me
'Cause I'm beggin' for you and I'm down on my knees
Baby, I know you're the one that I need
Baby I love you
You know that I need you
Gotta have you
Can't be without you
Baby I love you
You know I need you
Gotta have you
Can't be without you
Baby I love you
Baby I need you
I gotta have you
Can't be without you
Baby I love you
Baby I need you
I gotta have you
Can't be without you
Baby I love you
Baby I need you
I gotta have you
Can't be without you
Baby I love you
Baby I need you
I gotta have you
Can't be without you
