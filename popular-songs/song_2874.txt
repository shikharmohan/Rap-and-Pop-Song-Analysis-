Set me free why don't you baby?
Get out of my life why don't you baby?
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on
You don't really need me
But you keep me hangin' on
Why do you keep a comin' around
Playin' with my heart
Why don't you get out of my life
And let me make a new start
Let me get over you
The way you've gotten over me yeah
Set me free why don't you baby?
Let me be why don't you baby?
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on
Now you don't really need me
But you keep me hangin' on
You say although we broke up
You still wanna be just friends
But how can we be friends?
When seeing you only breaks my heart again
You claim you still care for me
But your heart and soul need to be free
Now that you've got your freedom baby
You wanna still hold on to me
You don't want me for yourself
So let me find somebody else yeah
Why don't you be a man about it and set me free?
You don't care a thing about me, you're just using me?
So get out get out get out of my life
And let me sleep at night
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on
Keep me hangin' on
Keep me hangin' on
