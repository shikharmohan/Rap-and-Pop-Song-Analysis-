Last night I was pouring out my heart
Like a waterfall to you
And with a one kiss
I was a runaway train
Flying off the track to you
I love you came flooding out
Couldn't make it stop
Couldn't shut my mouth
I felt like a fool then I lied and said I'm sorry
But I unapologize
I meant every word
Won't take back the way I feel about you
I cant unsay what you heard
Cause you heard me right
And I won't try to fight 'em back
Or hide my feelings for you
I unapologize
You know, people say a lot of things
That they don't really mean
And last night I told a little white lie
Hoping you'd forget the scene
Where it felt like a movie under that porch light
Couldn't help myself when you held me tight
Said what I meant then I lied and said I was sorry
I unapologize
I meant every word
Won't take back the way I feel about you
I cant unsay what you heard
Cause you heard me right
And i wont try to fight 'em back
Or hide my feelings for you
I unapologize
Ooh there's no time to be holding it all
And trying to pretend
That I don't feel anything
Ohh I shouldn't have said I'm sorry
I meant every word
Won't take back the way I feel about you
I cant unsay what you heard
cause you heard me right
and I wont try to fight 'em back
Or hide my feelings for you
I unapologize
Cause you heard me right, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I unapologize
