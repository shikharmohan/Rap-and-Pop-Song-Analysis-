Got up at dawn just to be out on the water
The weather man said, "Hot and gettin' hotter"
But he didn't say nothin' 'bout it raining like hell, oh well
A bad day of fishin' beats a good day of anything else
Had the big one on, and man I would'a got 'em
But he took my pole straight down to the bottom
Leavin' me with nothin' but a big ol' story to tell, ah hell
A bad day of fishin' beats a good day of anything else
We should probably go to work
I mean everybody does
Instead of sittin' out here in the middle of nowhere
Workin' on a pretty good buzz
Didn't catch a damn thing, guess you could say we took a lickin'
Tonight's fish fry is gonna taste like chicken
But we did just fine if I do say so myself
A bad day of fishin' beats a good day of anything else
Play that guitar
We should probably go to work
I mean everybody does
Instead of sittin' out here in the middle of nowhere
Workin' on a pretty good buzz
Didn't catch a damn thing, guess you could say we took a lickin'
Tonight's fish fry is gonna taste like chicken
But we did just fine if I do say so myself
You know a bad day of fishin' beats a good day of anything else
You know a bad day of fishin' beats a good day of anything else
