You can tell everyone, love is over and done
You can pack all your things and go
You can lie to yourself and say that there's nothing left
But there's something that I like you to know
It's never really over
Even though you say we're through
You may be over me, but can't you see
It's not over if I'm not over you
For there's not much I can do if it's over for you
I'll just wish you the best when you leave
But you've played such a part in my life and in my heart
You'll always be a part of me
And it's never really over
Even though you say we're through
You may be over me, but can't you see
It's not over if I'm not over you
You may be over me, but can't you see
It's not over if I'm not over you
