Back up wait a minute
Why you looking at me like that
Do you really wanna trip or you flip in the script
Do you wanna rap with a nigga
Or bang is a whoop in a rip
I don't eva want us to come the bust and shots, nigga misery cant produce enough cops and a'
Don't know if you wallin' or what?
All you wanna do is free stopping cop
Fan or Foe I don't really know
Off at the show niggas they know
But I look light, was a good night and i was looking like a mutha fukka wanna jack all me doe
Come up to me 
My kids would be chillin'
Betta think twice I'm a 5-6 villain
All they wanna talk about 
I did it 
When I did it
Man I thought I was gonna get a bullet in a minute
You Should be care full how you walk upon us
Got a bonus for all the opponents if they want it
I kno they wait for Tecca Ninna moments
Till' the opponent be poppin' up and hes you don't it
We don't if they be tripin' or not (NO)
Probably cuz all of them live on the block
when you rapping niggas know what you got
Toughest ever, when you up on the top
Show some respect when you approach me 
Don't you be mugging me 
Might have that drug in me 
Plug in a nigga, for nearly shrugging me
Ain't nothing wrong with people peeping,Geeking 
Where the man hoe
But the grandma so bama, stama
I don't know if you fan or foe
[Chorus Repeat 2X]
We be tripin', we can go
Peeping like hes seeking doe
Want the doe or want to go
I dont know if you fan or foe
I dont know if you fan or foe
I dont know if you fan or foe
Easy, hang and speak and brawl
I don't know if he fan or foe
Now easy how they speak
With broken teeth
That they did, young flow he can dope be choken 
So yo' ass and you be walking off with it broken 
Run up poor muthafukas in the open
Making them shut up
Woofing with that cold shit
Cant that shinanigans
Thinking you makes it the manikans
Thinking you silking the lotion
Back up wait a minute why you looking at me like that
I'm just a nigga with a little bit of fame but if you get the tripin' than im giving up my game
Never catch me sliping
You can get it out yo brain
Maine Fan or Foe!
Fuck a nigag try to get his hands on my doe
but if you really want come on
Try to get a, you can feed the unpulla
Tuck my hands on your throat
Man im a  Low
Want a background for sack town
Better watch out from the Blao Blao
BLACK OUT, BLACK OUT, BLACK OUT, BLACK OUT  (braararararaa ttataaaaa)
Stay with my kimers, stepping nockle doodle
Waicking there game on blood goca doodle
Think you gon catch me slip at a show
No factor slick Oh slack, shock a zoolu
Watch me do you
With all that fake shit
You fill with hate trade
Hoping wishing you wre my replacement
Courage so viciouse you gon' have to face it
They try to taste it
Cuz i laced it like a tennis shoes and Ive been a fool
Like Zeepo bitch and X-Raided
But this is a different interview
[Chorus Repeat 2X]
Living a bee a bad idea
If it never go home again
Nigga looking at me
Like imma chicken dinner
Looking back at niggas
Like a shot of hennessy
So i gotta carry the four
I don't really know though
Cuz they walking past me 
Giving me the eye
When they past me they be asking
When you new shit coming out
At tha picture house
They be huddled up and i think i might pick one out get tha nigga bigger than me 
For tha trigger to see
If he tough enough
Make it what he trying to be
But he aint bad though
Dont know how to approach a vulture
Get to close how im post up
Cant even live in peace
and when I eat with my peeps In the place
You in my face with your mix-tapes
and if i try to listen to it
We get it to it
and fo' all that fue it
Then its time to do it
Uhhhh...Cuz a nigga from out south out the mouth
Your girl be loving me giving me mouth to mouth
(yea)
But it aint fair that the music gotta do on what you wanna do when you aint there.
And if too softly, softy when you see me out you betta get out off me
[Chorus Repeat 2X]
