I saw you and fell in love
You saw me and fell in love too
You and me, we fell in love with each other last night
I told you that I was concerned
You told me of your concerns too
Yet and still we both decided to make love last night
Baby, please tell me
(Where do we go from here my love?)
What are we doing baby, boy you gotta let me know?
(Why can't we live the way we want?)
I want the world to know, I just gotta let it show
(What do we stand to lose?)
If being together is what we choose
Ohh, my love I think that we should talk about us
Could this be a crazy dream?
And if so then you're dreaming too
'Cause I know for sure that you feel the same as I do
I know you feel the same
Could it be that we could be wrong
Even though we're feeling so right
I don't care because I know
That I want you tonight and I know you want me too
(Where do we go from here my love?)
What are we doing baby, boy you gotta let me know?
(Why can't we live the way we want?)
I want the world to know, I just gotta let it show
(What do we stand to lose?)
If being together is what we choose
Ohh, my love I think that we should talk
You see all my live I've waited
Waited all my life
Just to be with someone like you
(Where do we go from here my love?)
Where are we going baby I wanna know
(Why can't we live the way we want?)
I want the world to know, I just gotta let it show
(What do we stand to lose?)
If being together is what we choose
Ohh, my love I think that we should talk about us
