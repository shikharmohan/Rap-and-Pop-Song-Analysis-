These four walls,
They whisper to me
They know a secret
I knew they would not keep
Didn't take long
For the room to fill with dust
And these four walls, came down around us
It must've been something, sent me out of my head
With the words so radical,
Not what i meant
Now I'll wait for a break in the silence
'Cause it's all that you left
Just me and these four walls again
It's hard now to let you be
I won't make excuses, 
I've made my peace
Didn't take long for me to lose the trust
And these four walls, were not strong enough
It must've been something sent me out of my head,
With the words so radical,
Not what i meant
Now I'll wait for a break in the silence
'Cause it's all that you left
Just me and these four walls again
Yeah
It's difficult
Watching us fade
Knowing it's all my fault
My mistake
Yeah, and it's difficult
Letting you down
Knowing it's all my fault
You're not around
It must've been something sent me out of my head,
With the words so radical,
Not what i meant,
Now I'll wait for a break in the silence
'Cause it's all that you left
Just me and these four walls again,
Again, mmmm, oh, me and these four walls again
