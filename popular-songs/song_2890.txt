(a duet with reba mcentire)
(mark d. sanders, tim nichols)
Linda:
You jet from coast to coast
Dressed in designer clothes
When you appear somewhere
Your chauffeur drives you there
I wouldn't think twice
If I could live your life
Reba:
You see your friends at the store
Your sister lives next door
You kiss your babies goodnight
Your husband's there at your side
I'd love to give it a try
If I could live your life
Chorus:
Both:
If I could trade places with you
Linda:
Hear the roar of the crowd
Reba:
And the church bells in a quiet town
Both:
Just for one moment in time
I wonder what this world would be like
If I could live your life
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
Linda:
Saw your picture in "people" today
Reba:
And I see you're in the pta
Linda:
You're living everyone's dream
Reba:
It isn't all that it seems
Both:
Wouldn't it be nice
If I could live your life
Repeat chorus
(reba only sings last line "if I could live your life"
Linda:
If I could live your life
Both:
If I could live your life
