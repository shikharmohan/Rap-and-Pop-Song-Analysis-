Twisted,
You've shaken my exsistence,
When I'm with you baby bliss is,
All I've come to know.
Running,
I didn't see it coming,
Blinded it's so stunning,
I don't wanna let you go.
A thousand church bells ringing,
I can hear the angels singing,
When you call my name,
Your love is off the chain.
The chemistry is crazy,
And you make me feel amazing,
And I can't explain,
Your love is off the chain.
Your love, your love, your love,
Your love, your love, your love.
Coming,
Just keep the magic coming,
You've got me baby crushing,
But it feels like so much more.
Just when,
When I least expected,
You make it feel so epic,
Like nothing i've felt before.
A thousand church bells ringing,
I can hear the angels singing,
When you call my name,
Your love is off the chain.
The chemistry is crazy,
And you make me feel amazing,
And I can't explain,
Your love is off the chain.
Your love, your love, your love,
Your love, your love, your love.
I'm not the type who gets crazy for someone,
Odds of me, tripping are like next to nothing,
Guarded my heart like a diamond ring,
But love, your love changes everything.
Everything has changed,
Everything has changed,
Everything has changed,
Your love is off the chain.
Everything has changed,
Everything has changed,
Now everything is changed,
Your...
A thousand church bells ringing,
I can hear the angels singing,
When you call my name,
Your love is off the chain.
The chemistry is crazy,
And you make me feel amazing,
And I can't explain,
Your love is off the chain.
Your love, your love, your love,
Your love, your love, your love.
Your love, your love, your love, love,
Your love, your love, your love, love,
Your love, your love, your love, love.
