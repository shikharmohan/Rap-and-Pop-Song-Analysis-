I cant get it back, but
I dont want it back, i
Realized that,
She dont know how to act
Never been a dumb dude
No im not dense
I Just had a slight lack
Of common sense
I was the good guy
She was the bad girl
Im thinking one girl
She thinking me, earl james and jimmy
Yep she had plenty
But love for me, she didnt have any
I was inviting, her into my heart
But she was out riding in some other manÃÂ¢€s car
She was my night time, thought I was her star
Guess I was wrong, but see im strong
Wont take me long for me to move on
Please dont worry bout me im fine
(Please dont worry bout me im fine)
Only gonna play the fool one time
(Only gonna play the fool one time)
Trust me when I say
That iÃÂ¢€ll be ok
Go on girl
(Go on girl)
Go on girl
(Go on girl)
Go on girl
I cant get it back, but
I dont want it back, i
Realized that,
She dont know how to act
Tried to settle down and look what I get
Thought it was my time, but I guess not yet
She at the bar getting drinks from many men
Im in the house, thinking shes with her girlfriends
Trust not knowing, truly not knowing
I look back now like, man, I was open
I was inviting, her into my heart
But she was out riding in some other manÃÂ¢€s car
She was my night time, thought I was her star
Guess I was wrong, but see im strong
Wont take me long for me to move on

Please dont worry bout me im fine

Trust me when I say

Go on girl
(Go on girl)
Go on girl
(Go on girl)
Go on girl
The mistake i made is clear
(we never shoulda been together)
Thats the reason youre not here
(I know that I can do much better)
Not a single salty tear
Not a feeling in my chest
Baby im feeling no stress
Im too fly to be depressed
Go on Girl
Go on Girl
Go on Girl
Go on Girl
Please dont worry bout me im fine
(Please dont worry bout me im fine)
Only gonna play the fool one time
(Only gonna play the fool one time)
Trust me when I say
That iÃÂ¢€ll be ok
Go on girl
(Go on girl)
Go on girl
(Go on girl)
