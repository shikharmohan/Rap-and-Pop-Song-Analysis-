(clint ballard, jr.)
Feelin' better
Now that we're through
Feelin' better
'cause I'm over you
I learned my lesson
It left a scar
But now I see
How you really are
Chorus:
You're no good, you're no good
You're no good...baby you're no good
I'm gonna say it again
You're no good, you're no good
You're no good...baby you're no good
Broke a heart
Gentle and true
Left a man
Over someone like you
I'll beg his forgiveness
On bended knee
But I wouldn't blame him
If he said to me
Repeat chorus
I'm tellin' you now baby
That I'm going my way
Forget about you baby
'cause I'm leaving today
