Yeah, whoa
I know this isn't what I wanted
I never thought it'd come this far
Just thinking back to where we started
And how we lost all that we are
We were young, and times were easy
But I could see it's not the same
I'm standing here, but you don't see me
Give it all for that to change
And I don't want to lose her, don't wanna let her go
Standing out in the rain
Need to know if it's over
'Cause I will leave you alone
Flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold ya
Like I did before the storm
Yeah, before the storm
With every strike of lightening
Comes a memory that lasts
And not a word is left unspoken
As a thunder starts to crash
Maybe I should give up
Standing out in the rain
Need to know if it's over
'Cause I will leave you alone
Flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold ya
Like I did before the storm
Trying to keep the light from going out
And the clouds from ripping out my broken heart
They always say a heart is not a home
Without the one who gets you through the storm
Standing out in the rain
Knowing that it's really over
Please don't leave me alone
Flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold ya
Like I did before the storm
Like I did before the storm
