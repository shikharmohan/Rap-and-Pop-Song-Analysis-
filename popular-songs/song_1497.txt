He walked in with a salty sway
Lookin' like black beard in his day
A brother in arms just like me
I was born a son of the sea
I can't be still, I can't be tied
The only time I, I feel alive
Is when the wind fills my sail
Riding on a lifelong swell
Let my heart take me where it wants to go
That's the soul of a sailor, the soul of a sailor
He slid a stool and a beer to me
Said, "You know, we're both a dying breed"
Here's to love lost and newfound friends
Living out life in the boat we're in
I can't be still, I can't be tied
The only time I, I feel alive
Is when the wind fills my sail
Riding on a lifelong swell
Let my heart take me where it wants to go
That's the soul of a sailor, the soul of a sailor
Let my heart take me where it wants to go
That's the soul of a sailor, the soul of a sailor
