Hush my baby, don't you cry
I'll dry your eyes, fulfill your heart's desire
Let's go in, try again
Careful this time, broken promises linger in our mind
I'll give in completely, hearts break so easy
I know, believe me, oh I've tried
But my arms can hold you, my kiss console you
I'll come and love you tonight
And I, I love, I love, I love
Love hurts sometimes but this feels right
You, you love, you love, you love
Though you've been burned you still return
Come and share my house, my home
And all I own I'd love to give to you
Aren't you tired of going along this lonely road?
It takes its toll on you
Give me your emotion, your heart's devotion
Give anything you like
And I'll give understanding, life's so demanding
I'm all you need to get by
And I, I love, I love, I love
Love hurts sometimes but this feels right
And you, you love, you love, you love
Though you've been burned you still return
I love, I love, I love
Love hurts sometimes but this feels right
And you, you love, you love, you love
Though you've been burned you still return
Still return, still return to love, keep coming back to love
