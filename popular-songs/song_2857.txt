I can't get used to the hustle
I try to keep my actions straight
I get caught in the bustle
I do things I really hate
Just when I think I'm sinking
I hear a voice inside my head
Says, "Don't do what you're thinking
Send your thoughts to me instead"
Somebody up there likes me
Somebody up there knows what I need
And when my worldly head spins around
He sends His love down
You know I'm only a human
That's what I always say
It's just excuses
So I can do things my own way
But, when I fall and I stumble
I know I will be saved
No, my world won't crumble
I'll make it through the hardest days
Somebody up there likes me
Somebody up there knows what I need
And when my worldly head spins around
He sends His love down
I wish I'd known all along
But it's much better late
Than to never
Know you're wrong
Somebody up there likes me
Somebody up there knows what I need
When my worldly head spins around
He sends His love down
Somebody up there likes me
Somebody up there knows what I need
When my worldly head spins around
He sends His love down
He sends His love down
Somebody up there likes me
