Let me try to explain, it's not the roses or champagne
That really touch my heart
How can I make you see? You're the best at loving me
When you don't know you are
'Coz baby, it's the way that you reach out while you're sleepin'
And gently hold my hand the whole night through
It's how you listen when I'm pourin' out my feelings
And baby when I feel the most from you
Is when you're not tryin' to
You don't need to rehearse, some sweet romantic words
To whisper in my ear
So just forget the poetry, what comes naturally
Is what I long to hear
Baby it's the way that you reach out while you're sleepin'
And gently hold my hand the whole night through
It's how you listen when I'm pourin' out my feelings
Baby when I feel the most from you
Is when you're not tryin' to
It's in your eyes, and in your smile
In the passion of your kiss
It's takin' me, in your arms so easily, so easily
It's how you listen when I'm pourin' out my feelings
Baby when I feel the most from you
Is when you're not tryin' to
Is when you're not tryin' to
When you're not tryin' to
