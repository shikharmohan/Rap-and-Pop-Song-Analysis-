He said, "I'll make your dreams come true in Texas"
And he captured my Appalachian heart
I was so naive that I believed him
When he promised we'd never be apart
So we packed and pulled a U-Haul down to Dallas
A year went by and the baby came along
Then his old friends and the night life came between us
Dreams turned into sleepless nights waiting all alone
And I'm staring out the window through these teardrops
Holding on to the only dream that turned out right
We're on a Greyhound bus bound for West Virginia
He's in Dallas without us tonight
Oh, Lord I hate to break the news to mama
She's getting on in years and worries so
Maybe I should have stayed in Dallas
And gave him another chance right now I just don't know
I'm staring out the window through these teardrops
Holding on to the only dream that turned out right
We're on a Greyhound bus bound for West Virginia
He's in Dallas without us tonight
He said, "I'll make your dreams come true in Texas"
And he's in Dallas without us tonight
