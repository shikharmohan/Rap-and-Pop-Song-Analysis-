Yeah, J-J-J-JB
Yeah, woah, woah, no, no
Now I can see it, girl
You ain't gotta say nothing
Your lips are calling me
Like they wanna do something
I feel the chemistry
Yeah, you're givin' me
A little kiss is a definite possibility
Seen you a couple times
Had a couple conversations
Since you been on my mind
Made a couple observations
Like you a fly chick, you could be my chick
Play by the rules and you can get what I give
Just keep it quiet, keep it on the hush
And what we do, keep it just between us
I don't wanna see you tweet about JB
'Cause the only people that should know is you and me
So baby, I know that you're cool with rocking with me
But I can't have you telling everybody
Got me all twisted with your lips like this
So tell me, tell me are you gonna kiss, kiss and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss, kiss and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss me, then tell everybody
You got me twisted with your lips, girl
Are you gonna kiss and tell?
It's confidential
No one has to do with it
But you and me, girl
Tell and we'll ruin it
Don't need that T.M.Z.
All in our privacy
Use them lips for kissing, girl
If you wanna ride with me
And if you wanna tell somebody
Then we can call the whole thing off, no problem
You can go your way and I'll go mine
But I'd rather spend a little time with you, yeah
Just keep it quiet, keep it on the hush
And what we do, keep it just between us
I don't wanna see you tweet about JB
'Cause the only people that should know is you and me
So baby, I know that you're cool with rocking with me
But I can't have you telling everybody
Got me all twisted with your lips like this
So tell me, tell me, are you gonna kiss, kiss and tell?
Tell me, are you gonna kiss, kiss and tell?
Tell me, are you gonna kiss me then tell everybody?
'Cause you got me twisted with your lips, girl
Are you gonna kiss and tell?
Tell, said, are you gonna kiss and tell, tell?
Said, are you gonna kiss and tell, tell?
Said, are you gonna kiss and tell?
Kiss and tell, oh
Don't tell your homies
Don't tell your mama
Don't tell your girlfriends
That'll start some drama
Stay off that Facebook
I'll treat you real good
You keep this private
And you can get what I give
Baby, I know that you're cool with rocking with me
But I can't have you telling everybody,
Got me all twisted with your lips like this
So tell me, tell me, are you gonna kiss, kiss and tell?
Tell me, are you gonna kiss, kiss and tell?
Tell me, are you gonna kiss me then tell everybody?
'Cause you got me twisted with your lips, girl
Are you gonna kiss and tell?
Kiss and tell, woahh, ooh
I'm not about that if you're gonna kiss and tell
No, no, no, if you're gonna kiss and tell
If you're gonna kiss and tell that's not me
