Yeah, I was colder then December
Never thought that you would enter my life that day
Love so gentle and so tender
And I really don't remember feeling this way
I owe it all to you
I feel so blue like I can't lose
And everybody knows 'cause it just shows
I wear a glow, I like the fit of love
Up here with you is where I wanna be
And I'm not coming down
I like how your love just fits on me
Like it's gently wrapped around
I'm covered from my head to my feet
With everything it does
It stays on me because, oh yeah
I like the fit of love
You're the reason and the meaning
For new things I believe in
You make me smile again
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And I wouldn't change nothing
I won't wish ya could've rushed it
Don't wanna change the way it is, oh no
I'm in a better place
Those hurtful days have gone away
And everybody sees that you love me
And I'm complete, I like the fit of love, oh yeah
Up here with you is where I wanna be
And I'm not coming down
I like how your love just fits on me
Like it's gently wrapped around
I'm covered from my head to my feet
With everything it does
It stays on me because
I like the fit of love
All when you was new with me
One night like I used to be
Like still you're not for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't know how to take me now
Ain't easy break it down
'Cause I'm wearing love on me
And it fits too deep, I like the fit of love
Up here with you is where I wanna be
And I'm not coming down
I like how your love just fits on me
Like it's gently wrapped around
I'm covered from my head to my feet
With everything it does
It stays on me because
I like the fit of love
Up here with you is where I wanna be
And I'm not coming down
I like how your love just fits on me
Like it's gently wrapped around
I'm covered from my head to my feet
With everything it does
It stays on me because, yeah
I like the fit of love
