Yeah, yeah, let's go
This is feelin' real good
Well you know it feels good to feel good
You look familiar, girl
I should remember, girl
If I ever ran into you
Refresh my memory
Your smile is killin' me
Where did we go and what'd we do?
Wait, it's comin' back
You was at that club
You spilled your drink on me
Damn, I wanted you
You disappeared
But now you're back
Let's take it from here
Do it, do it
I gotta do it, do it
We gotta do it this time around
Let's do it tonight
Do it, do it
I gotta do it, do it
We gotta do it this time around
Let's do it tonight
Girl, this is kinda cool
Me bumpin' into you
You here alone or with your man?
I dropped the ball before
Let you slip out the door
Won't let you get away again
Girl, I'm real impressed
And it ain't just
Because you're light skinned
Girl, let's shake this spot
Back to my crib
Come on, let's go
Let's take it from here
Do it, do it
I gotta do it, do it
We gotta do it this time around
Let's do it tonight
Do it, do it
I gotta do it, do it
We gotta do it this time around
Let's do it tonight
Do it, do it
I gotta do it, do it
We gotta do it this time around
Let's do it tonight
Do it, do it
I gotta do it, do it
We gotta do it this time around
Let's do it tonight
