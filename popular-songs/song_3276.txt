[Tech N9ne: Intro]
I now pronounce
Me and music together
From now
Until the end of time (time)
[Tech N9ne]
Always on the road
Doing hella shows
Day to day, high and lows
But that's just how it goes when you grinding
Homie ain't no rewinding time with the family behind
In this business that I'm in
I don't feel anything
It's hard remembering places and faces
They think I'm what December brings
The day is just like moments turned to hours
Autographs, sound check, radio spots and quick showers
Hit the stage and get so much love from the fans
Keep it rough with the fellas
But I make the ladies wanna dance
And still I don't think you understand what's real
While I'm with you
With my wife, another chance is killed
And my kids, 
All 3 of them suffer in the worst way
Cause last year I missed all three of their birthdays
So when you see me with my eyes full of pain, give me love
Cause these are three of the reasons why I call the road the rain
[Chorus]
So here we are now (In the rain) 
A superstar now (In the rain) 
So far now (In the rain)
The Rain (I walk in the rain) 
I live my life like (In the rain) 
Just for the limelite (Is it right or is it wrong) 
[Alyia Yates, (Tech N9ne)]
(My little girl says)
Daddy (What'up)
Me and Reign really miss you (Oh yeah)
Not to mention momma always need a tissue (Yeah)
I saw your picture in the paper and I kissed you (Oh yeah)
I heard you won't be home for Halloween
Is this true? (Right after Halloween baby)
Yeah I'm used to it
Why don't you teach me and Reign how to produce music? (Ha)
So we can travel everywhere that you travelin, 
Being a family me and sissy fightin and tattelin (Haha)
I know you miss that (No)
I know you dig that
Do your fans ever wonder about where your kids at? (Yeah)
Is Donny really comin to move with us in L.A.? (Uh...)
Will mommy still love you and be with you everyday? (Um...)
I gotta go now, I love you daddy but slow down (Yeah)
There's not enough Tecca Ninas to go around (Aw...)
Reignbow's cryin, she wants to talk to you badly
(What's up Reignbow baby?)
[Reign Yates] I love you daddy
[Chorus]
So here we are now (In the rain) 
A superstar now (In the rain) 
So far now (In the rain)
The Rain (I walk in the rain) 
I live my life like (In the rain) 
Just for the limelite (Is it right or is it wrong) 
[Tech N9ne] 
I love my fans, 
Cause they make it possible for me to provide for the fam
The fact that my life is in shambles
They could give a damn
When it shakes, then they choose it
Fakes who hate, lose it
They love my pain cause it makes for great music
But in the interim
This family matter is a tender one
I might leave in January and come back
When the winter come
Like, calling my wife in the rain and end up getting into a dumb fight
Cause she lonely, you try to consult her but you ain't come right
So it's about what and what?
You give them everything they need
But what they need is your presence indeed
Life, yes it's been a strainer
It's like I've been a stranger to my kids and my wife
That's the life of an entertainer
More money to gain
More people to change
Sore deep in the game
The worlds peepin my pain
Out on the road bustin for sure, reachin for fame
Healthy relationships, 
You can't have them when you live your life in the rain
[Chorus][2x]
So here we are now (In the rain) 
A superstar now (In the rain) 
So far now (In the rain)
The Rain (I walk in the rain) 
I live my life like (In the rain) 
Just for the limelite (Is it right or is it wrong)
