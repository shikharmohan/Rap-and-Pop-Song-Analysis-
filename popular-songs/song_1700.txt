I'll tell you what we're gonna do
What you need to know
What you gotta get to get where you wanna go
Never ever miss a noun
Keep your eyes on all displays
When you find your style
Every day's a holiday
i'll show you how to work it
To find the fit that's perfect
You know that you deserve it
Whoa Whoa Whoa
This is the good life
Take a good look have anything you want
This is the good life
Dining with your friends at a fancy restaurant
Living the good life
We have such a good time, I know
Grab a little Gucci bag
And some Prada shoes
Here, take my credit card
They're all here to wait on you
Jimmy Choo calls out your name
D&G; on every wall
When you can't decide
That's okay just buy them all
There's no better feeling(oh)
There's nothing more appealing(hey)
The door, front, floor, the ceiling
Whoa, whoa, whoa
This is the good life
Take a good look have anything you want
This is the good life 
Dining with your friends at a fancy restaurant
Living the good life 
We have such a good time I know
Can't be slow
Never stop
Fill those bags up to the top
Turn around
Try it on
Now off to the hair salon
Joanie says, "I'll just pay,
There's no need for lay-away."
Slide your plastic, flash your cash.
Ring it up, it's such a blast
1,2,3,4
This is the good life
Take a good look have anything you want
This is the good life
Dining with your friends at a fancy restaurant
Living the good life 
We have such a good time, you know
(the good life)
Oh, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, the good life
Oh, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, I'm livin the good life
Oh, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, the good life
Yeahh
