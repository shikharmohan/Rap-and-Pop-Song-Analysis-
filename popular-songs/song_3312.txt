When you see me smilin'
I'm really frownin'
You think you really wilin'
I'm killa klownin'
Meaning i don't give a fuck about nothin'
You say that you do because stupid
Iz how everybody soundin'
Niggah you think you know me
But only if you knew me homie
You leave me by my lonely
I'm thinkin' death and destruction
Imagez of blood n pus and
I ain't lookin' for nothin' but trouble
Thinkin' of murderin' you when i'm just loungin'
That'z just the devil (just the devil)
Block it out and keep it movin'
I'm evil and this pussy that i'm pursuin'
Gimme the bible yes i need it
Cuz tecca nina'z in ruin
Mentally i'm fuckin' up when i really don't know what i'm doin'
My tolerance for physical pain is gained rapidly
I'm gobblin' more thizzlez than thangz but it came back at me
The holy father musta flipped and became mad at me
Because i'm ponderin' a wicked insane strategy
How to end it all?
Many men will fall
And he sent us all
Nina been involved
Don't really want it wit me fuck ya don't have to go
I taste the blood on my tongue makin me wanna brawl	
That sentimental shit 
That is the penalty for any bitch you try to re-kennel this 
And I got the triple head
Bout to bubble about to pop just like a pimple gets
Seein something so insane I'm sewn off with simple shit
So teeter-totter if you want it but just keep it to the left of me,
Crazy til the death of me
Pussy money more money blood and guts is the recipe
Havin hella drama for Nina is a necessity
Good and bad is fightin within me and im the referee
Shit is lookin like it is even gettin the best of me
