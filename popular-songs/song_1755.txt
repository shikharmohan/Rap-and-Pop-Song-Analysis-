You wake up it's raining and its Monday
looks like one of those rough days 
times up your late again so get out the door 
sometimes you feel like running 
find a whole new life and jump in
let go get up and hit the dance floor 
when the lights go down its the ending of the show 
and your feeling like you've got no where to go
don't you know
(chorus)
you can change your hair. you can change clothes
you can change your mind , thats just the way it goes 
you can say goodbye and you can say hello 
but you'll always find your way back home 
you can change your style you can change your jeans 
you can learn to fly and you chase your dreams 
you can laugh and cry but everybody knows 
you'll always find your way back home
your best friends your little home town
waiting up where ever you go now
you know that you can always turn around 
cuz' this world is big and its crazy
and this girl is thinking that maybe
that this life is what some people dream about
cuz' when I'm feeling down 
and I'm all alone
I've always got a place were i can go 
cuz' i know
chorus)
you can change your hair. you can change clothes
you can change your mind , thats just the way it goes 
you can say goodbye and you can say hello 
but you'll always find your way back home 
you can change your style you can change your jeans 
you can learn to fly and you chase your dreams 
you can laugh and cry but everybody knows 
you'll always find your way back home
 
and they know exactly who you are 
where the real you is a superstar
you know its never to far away
you can change your hair. you can change clothes
you can change your mind , thats just the way it goes 
you can say goodbye and you can say hello 
but you'll always find your way back home 
you can change your hair. you can change clothes
you can change your mind , thats just the way it goes 
you can say goodbye and you can say hello 
but you'll always find your way back home 
 you can change your style you can change your jeans 
you can learn to fly and you chase your dreams 
you can laugh and cry but everybody knows 
you'll always find your way back home
you'll always find your way back home
you'll always find your way back home
you'll always find your way back home
you'll always find your way back home
you'll always find your way back home
