Big Bad Wolf 
(Hook) 
I've got myÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ Gun on spray, so don't try toÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ (Pop! Pop!)
Run awayÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ Hit em with the big bad wolfÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ 86 sick streak inside of meÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ 
(1st Verse) 
I'm giving em a dilemmaÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
The coming of a killer, the phantom of all niggas who wanna be "Nina"ÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ But listenÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
I kill a bitch in a vision of "Milli-Vanilli"ÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
Motherfuckers who's being murdered by the big bad wolfÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
ComputerismÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ I'll give em aÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ PushÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
Ripped you and your mocking crew, what you gonna do when I pop at you, glock at youÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
Fill em with the venomÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ Who the fuck are you talking to? 
Betray me? you crazy! The kind of souls say Kevin SpaceyÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
Niggas hate me, cant face meÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ Bitches like Cagney and Lacey, basicallyÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ You can't ace meÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
I put that on school is the Lil Tracey, ya better mace me, cause I'ma fuck up a niggas careerÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
If you think you trying to bite me, taste me; listen to meÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ 
Like guerilla monsoonÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ I'ma a wolf, so I howl at the motherfucking moonÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
I can smell a rotten fella, cotton dwella; hella props to the jella, my nigga loomÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
2 little pigsÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ Niggas who wanted to be the big bad wolfÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ Tecca Nina cloneÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
That's why this little piggy hit the carpet and the other little piggy stayed homeÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
ChromeÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ Huff and I'll puffÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ And I'll blow that fucking mic down and stuffÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
Hit me with a silver bullet and get it outta me, cause a weak bullet is only a mini-technicalityÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ Follow me niggaÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
If you gotta be "Nina" to get a bigger salary motherfuckerÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
To bust flows like Joe's or like those who make relish and throw midwest blows at foesÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ 
Take another look, you ain't off the hook, you been peeking in my book nigga, lookÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ 
Take another look, you ain't off the hook, you been peeking in my book nigga, lookÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
Take another look, you ain't off the hook, you been peeking in my book nigga, lookÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
You being a bitch as in Brooke, you're nothing but a crookÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
So you niggas can't fuck with the big bad wolfÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦

You thought you built yo rhymeÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ Outta some brickÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦

Let's findÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ Who got the way tight licksÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ I bet mineÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ You'll get em, cause they like thisÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
The real shitÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ Mama MiaÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ Disagree-AÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ I really better see aÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦. Then be aÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
Cause when a nigga flowed what he wrote, sorryÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦

You little niggasÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ You can't fuck with the wolf, you a devil with hooves and death booksÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ Came to a Tech N9ne show and got tookÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦. By the lyrical anghellical voice that's shookÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
Satan, the lord rebutes yaÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ The power of Christ compels youÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
To get the "Haff" away from the "Ish"ÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
I'm spitting; you're losing, I'm sorry to tell youÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
Who the man now? Who the man now?
MotherfuckerÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ You a student, put ya hand downÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
Trying to growl like a wolfÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ Trying to pop like a Tech N9neÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
Little nigga, you can't peck mineÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
I'ma hairy motherfucker with whiskers and I flips a hella script from here to LamaviskaÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
Kiss the fist of a nigga who walks so hard on niggas like you, I'll get a goddamned blisterÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ NiggaÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ I'll huff and I'll puffÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ And I'll blow that fucking mic down and stuffÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
