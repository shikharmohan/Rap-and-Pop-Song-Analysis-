I realized as I lay down to sleep
We haven't spoke in weeks
So many things that I'd like to know
Come have a talk with me
I need a sign, something I can see
Why all the mystery?
I try not to fall for make believe
But what is reality?
Where do we go? What do we know?
Life has to have a meaning
Show me the light, show me the way
Show that you're listening
Show me that you love me
Show me that you walk with me
Hopefully just above me
Heaven's watching over me
Guess it's funny how I say thanks to you
For all you've given me
And sometimes the price of what you gave to me
Is I can't stop questioning
Oh, God of love, peace and mercy
So why so much suffering?
I pray for the world, it gets worse to me
I wonder if you're listening
When people go, why do they go?
Why don't you choose me?
But someday I know that I'm gonna go
I hope you're waiting for me
Show me that you love me
Show me that you walk with me
Hopefully just above me
Heaven's watching over me
Show me
To show me
Maybe we'll talk some other night
Right now I'll take it easy
Won't spend my time waiting to die
Enjoy the life I'm living
Show me that you love me
Show me that you walk with me
Hopefully just above me
Heaven's watching over me
Show me that you love me
Show me that you walk with me
Hopefully just above me
Heaven's watching over me
