I didn't see the fire burn to ashes
I couldn't feel the winds of change
I was lost inside the passion
Blinded by the memory of a flame
I guess, I should've felt it when you touched me
I should've seen it in your eyes
But I believed you really loved me
Why can't I believe you've said goodbye?
Oh why, is the last one to know
The first one to cry and the last to let go
Why is the one left behind
The one left alone with no one to hold
The last one to know
It would be easier to face the mornin'
If you were holdin' me tonight
But you left me without a warning
Holdin' onto a heartache while she's holdin' you tight
Tell me why, is the last one to know
The first one to cry and the last to let go
Why is the one left behind
The one left alone with no one to hold
The last one to know
