And so I wrote this song for you
I think I know just what you're going through
Did you believe you'd never change
And nothin' ever stays the same
I know it's hard holdin' on
And even harder trying to let it go
And so you're frozen like a stone
But you are not alone
Every step I take, I get a little less afraid
Of giving in to love, love, let it out
Believe me when I say, it gets better every day
Once you get used to the pain
What you hide inside I see
There's a scar that's always gonna be
And there's a past in everyone
You can't undo, you can't outrun, I don't know
Every step I take, I get a little less afraid
Of giving in to love, love, let it out
Believe me when I say it gets better every day
Once you get used to the pain
Every step I take, I get a little less afraid
Of giving in to love, love, let it out
Believe me when I say it gets better every day
Once you get used to the pain
Once you get used to the pain
In my life I've been proud of living
How long this same road
And all my life I've been wanting attention
How long this same road
I found faith
