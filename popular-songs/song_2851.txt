I just got the wedding invitation
There's gonna be a celebration
Like you've never seen
Just fit for a queen
She's got her mom and daddy's blessing
She's got a long white wedding dress
And his wedding ring
Oh, what can I bring
What do you give the girl who has everything
She's got the man who used to hold me
She's got the man who told me I was his everything
She's got the man who used to love me
Who placed no one above me, how he made my heart sing
Oh, what can I bring
What do you give the girl who has everything
She'll hear his promise of forever
She'll hear him say what
I could never get him to say
Oh, he'll say it today
She'll hold his hand and throw the flowers
Drink champagne till the morning hours
The queen has her king
And the world on a string
So what do you give the girl who has everything
She's got the man who used to hold me
She's got the man who told me I was his everything
She's got the man who used to love me
Who placed no one above me, how he made my heart sing
Oh, what can I bring
Tell me, what do you give the girl who has everything
What do you give the girl who has everything
