(Bobby Russell)
He was on his way home from candle top
Been two weeks gone and he thought he'd stop
At Web's and have him a drink for he went home to her
Andy wo-lo said hello
He said "Hi what's a doing?"
Wo said "Sit down I got some bad news that's gonna hurt
Said I'm your best friend and you know that's right
But your young bride ain't home tonight
Since you been gone she's been seeing that amos boy Seth"
He got mad and he saw red
Andy said "Boy don't you lose your head
Cause to tell you the truth I've been with her myself"
Chorus:
That's the night the lights went out in georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Don't trust your soul to no back woods southern lawyer
Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hand
Andy got scared and left the bar
Walking on home cause he didn't live far you see
Andy didn't have many friends and he just lost him one
Brother thought his wife must've left town
So he went home and finally found the only thing
Daddy had left him and that was a gun
He went off to Andy's house
Slipping through the back woods quiet as a mouse
Came upon some tracks too small for Andy to make
He looked through the screen at the back porch door
He saw Andy lying on the floor
In a puddle of blood and he started to shake
The Georgia patrol was making their rounds
So he fired a shot just to flag 'em down
And a big bellied sheriff grabbed his gun and said
"Why'd you do it?" 
The judge said guilty in a make believe trial
Slapped the sheriff on the back with a smile and said
"Suppers waiting at home and I got to get to it"
Chorus
They hung my brother before I could say
The tracks he saw while on his way
To Andy's house and back that night were mine
And his cheatin wife had never left town
And that's one body that'll never be found
You see little sister don't miss when she aims her gun
Repeat chorus twice
