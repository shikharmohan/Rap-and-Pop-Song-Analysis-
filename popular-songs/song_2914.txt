Do you hold her all night long?
Do you sing her our love song?
Do you kiss her lips
Until love makes her weak?
Oh darlin'
Do you promise her the moon?
Does she think love's comin' soon?
Does she know each move
Is made from memory?
Oh darlin'
Everytime you touch her
  (Every time)
Everytime you touch her
Think of me
When she reaches out for you
The same way my arms do
Does she know the truth
Your love belongs to me?
Oh baby
Do you wander in the dark
  (Do you wander?)
If she sees into your heart
Do you close your eyes ?
So she will never see
Oh baby
Everytime you touch her
  (Everytime)
Everytime you touch her
Think of me
Nights were never
  (Nights)
Made to spend alone
I can wish you love
  (I)
But I can't wish you gone
Do you hold her all night long?
  (Do you hold her?)
Do you sing her our love song?
Do you kiss her lips
Until love makes her weak?
Oh darlin'
Everytime you touch her
  (Everytime)
Everytime you touch her
Think of me
