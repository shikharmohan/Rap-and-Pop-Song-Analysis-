Well, here we are again, me and my friends on a Friday night
Waitin' on Jimmy, he's always gotta get his hair just right
Bobby yells, "Where we gonna go?"
Ah, you'd think by now he'd know
Where the girls are where the fun is
Where the heads get turned and the games begin
Might get you a name and a number
Kiss and a heart, oh, where the girls are
Pile three in my truck, the rest follow us and we'll head downtown
Ah, we all know the drill, hit Jack and Jill's then the Cavalier Lounge
Jimmy, "You run in and look around
And we'll know if you don't come out"
Ah, that's where the girls are, where the fun is
Where the heads get turned and the games begin
Might get you a name and a number
Kiss and a heart, where the girls are
If we gotta cross the county line
Oh, you can bet we're gonna find
Where the girls are, where the fun is
Where the heads get turned and the games begin
Might get you a name and a number
Kiss and a heart
Ah, where the girls are, where the fun is
Where the heads get turned and the games begin
Might get you a name and a number
Kiss and a heart, oh, where the girls are
Where the girls are, where the girls are
I think we hit a gold mine
