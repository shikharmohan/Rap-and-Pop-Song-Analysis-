Style of your hair
Shape of your eyes and your nose
The way you stare
As if you see, right through to my soul
It's your left hand and the way
That it's not quite as big as your right
The way you stand in the mirror
Before we go out at night
Our quiet time
Your beautiful mind
They're all part of the list, things that I miss
Things like your funny little laugh
Or the way you smile, or the way we kiss
What I noticed is this
I come up with something new
Every single time that I sit and reminisce
The way your sweet smell
Lingers when you leave a room
Stories you tell as we lay in bed all afternoon
I dreamed you now every night
In my mind is where we meet
And when I'm awake staring at pictures of you asleep
Touching your face
Invading you space
They're all part of the list, things that I miss
Things like your funny little laugh
Or the way you smile, or the way we kiss
What I noticed is this
I come up with something new
Every single time that I sit and reminisce
And you live in my memories
Forever more I swear
And you live in my memories
Forever more I swear
They're all part of the list, things that I miss
Things like your funny little laugh
Or the way you smile, or the way we kiss
What I noticed is this
I come up with something new
Every single time that I sit and reminisce
