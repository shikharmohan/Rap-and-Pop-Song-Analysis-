You muthafuckas thing we gonna stop keepin' on
We shall prevail
Muthafuckas fear what they do not understand
And what they do not understand, they try and destroy
Come on, now
I hear 'em whisperin' in corners, speakin' dirty talk on us
'Bout how we too grown up, that we unknowners
And my persona is rock 'n' rollish
Yo', nigga told us, every word that you quoted
Said I wouldn't be the one that sold it, but ha, we exploded
I'm that rap nigga that you heard with 2Pac, Sole
Lynch and Bo, Wake Up Show wit King Tech and Sway
Yukmouth, Thicker Than Water, Gang Related, Eminem
Roger Trout, MC Ren, nigga Spice-1 and them
Hit 'em wit a venom, send 'em down, kill 'em when I spit
When I get a bit of scrilla, Tech is givin' niggas shit
Love 'em, love us but the playa hatin' niggas betta split
It'll neva be another Tecca Nina when I quit
You better kneel when you hear a nigga that's real
I feel 18 when I bust from the grill
Because, if you keep it young, yo' song is always sung
So, street life taught me to keep 'em sprung
God sent me to kill, lyrical scripts
The miracle whipped, you demons and hatas who tripped
Listen, I really feel my Villainty real when he spit
Fuck them, plus, anybody they go get and shit
You can pray and pray for my downfall
When I rise like the sun, I ain't fuckin' wit y'all
I'ma keep on keepin' on, keep on holdin' on
You can pray and pray for my downfall
When I rise like the sun, I ain't fuckin' wit y'all
I'ma keep on keepin' on, keep on holdin' on
The storm consumes all the sun and moon fall
When you saw the mega morion, Gregorian Jet and Ru Pauls
Extreme case of blue balls 'cuz you bang got fruit all in his veins
What I'm sayin' is I will reign, murder you, all in his name
Biss malla wit the fist in a pistola
Dismiss the kiss from a hiss giva
Wrist slita, male bitch or witch wit a twist
A glitch man abyss swimma, trick
I will never slide, never fall, never fail
Never the Devils side, ever call, never Hell
But I got these muthafuckas prayin' for my downfall
But the orange hair means time to clown y'all
Thanks to Jenny, I'll get the message to many
The circus is comin' and gunnin' wit plenty
I heard that Bakari got a poster of me burnin'
To get his earnin's concernin', not I killed him but he ain't learnin'
Nigga, you couldn't burn me wit acid or in a firey pit
You couldn't burn in a volcano, where lava is spit
You couldn't burn me, if you damned me to Hell, where Satan sit
The only way that you can burn me is wit ya bitch, nigga
You can pray and pray for my downfall
When I rise like the sun, I ain't fuckin' wit y'all
I'ma keep on keepin' on, keep on holdin' on
You can pray and pray for my downfall
When I rise like the sun, I ain't fuckin' wit y'all
I'ma keep on keepin' on, keep on holdin' on
Why don't you niggas keep ya mouth shut?
Without us, you clout sucks, you doubt us and get ya mouth bust
We veterans and better then you young cheesy cheddar men
Bouncin' across the nation and you home watchin' Letterman
I'm the nigga that got 'em listenin', I know it's sickenin'
To know I'm the nigga got girlies coochie glistenin'
From listenin' to my shit and when I get her for christenin'
She splits again 'cuz I made her spit the nitro glycerin
I'm on you, callin' me a old negro
But I don't know a young nigga that could hold me though
Plus, the dough be low, average and I hold the glow
But they want me to fall, so they can say, "I told you so"
But if I'm mutli punks would say I just lucked up
Keep talkin' that shit, might getcha fucked up
You some Jimmy Rucker, Tommy Tucker type of muthafuckas
Glamorize and specialize in gettin' butt fucked
Niggas, think they dope, then gonna try to check me
I'm here to let yo' ass know you need to respect me
'Cause although you ain't sayin' shit, you gettin' on my nerves
I'ma keep on keepin' on, mufucka, that's word
You can pray and pray for my downfall
When I rise like the sun, I ain't fuckin' wit y'all
I'ma keep on keepin' on, keep on holdin' on
You can pray and pray for my downfall
When I rise like the sun, I ain't fuckin' wit y'all
I'ma keep on keepin' on, keep on holdin' on
They say I don't fit in
But I won't listen
You can say what you wanna, I'ma come up from a
Life from livin' gutta, I have to be no otha
Say what you wanna, I'ma come up from a
Life from livin' gutta, I have to be no otha
Keep on keepin' on, keep on, holdin' on
Keep on keepin' on, keep on, holdin' on
So now, do you understand?
Is the picture clear with ya?
Fuck y'all niggas
