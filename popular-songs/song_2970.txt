I guess I'm just one of those
Who believes there has to be a reason
For livin' and breathin'
Everytime you pull me close
Something tells me there'll be no more reachin'
You're everything I'm needin'
Oh, I don't know how it happened
I never thought I would
Find someone to complete me
Oh, I just can't explain it
This feelin' that I get
Oh, there ain't no way to name it
But I'm thinkin' baby
Maybe it's the way you look at me
Like there'll never be another
I get swept away baby when
We get so caught up in each other
I don't know where you end and I begin
Where you end and I begin
All it takes is just one kiss
I just wanna get lost in this emotion
Like the river in the ocean
oh, when you wrap your arms around me
It happens every time
Time don't seem to matter
We'll always be together
I don't know what it is
That tells me it's forever
But I'm thinkin' baby
Maybe it's the way you look at me
Like there'll never be another
I get swept away, hey baby when
We get so caught up in each other
Maybe it's the way you look at me
A like there'll never be another
I get swept away baby when
We get so caught up in each other
I don't know where you end and I begin
Where you end and I begin
Maybe it's the way you look at me
Like there'll never be another
I get swept away, hey baby when
We get so caught up in each other
Maybe it's the way you look at me
Like there'll never be another
I get swept away, hey baby when
