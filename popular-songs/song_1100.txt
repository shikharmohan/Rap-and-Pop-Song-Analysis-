I can see it in your eyes
And feel it your touch
I know that you're scared
But you've never been this loved
It's a long shot baby
Yeah I know it's true
But if anyone can make it
I'm betting on me and you
Just keep on moving into me
I know you're gonna see
The best is yet to come
But don't fear it now we're going all the way
That sun is shining on a brand new day
It's a long way down and it's a leap of faith
But I'm never giving up
'Cause I know we got a once in a lifetime love
Everybody's looking for what we found
Some wait their whole life
And it never comes around
So don't hold back now just let go
On all you've ever known
You can put you're hand in mine
And don't fear it now we're going all the way
That sun is shining on a brand new day
It's a long way down and it's a leap of faith
But I'm never giving up
'Cause I know we got a once in a lifetime love
I close my eyes and I see you standing right there
Saying "I do" and they're throwing the rice in our hair
Well the first one's born and a brother comes along and he's got your smile
I been looking back on the life we had still by your side
So don't fear it now we're going all the way
That sun is shining on a brand new day
It's a long way down and it's a leap of faith
But I'm never giving up
'Cause I know we got a once in a lifetime love
Lifetime love
