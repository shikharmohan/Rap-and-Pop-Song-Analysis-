Just when I thought that
It never could happen to me
He touched me and feelings that
Never have stirred in me ever like this are in his kiss
Heart, where are you takin' me?
What will you make of me? Is this the real thing?
And heart, could he be paradise?
'Cause in his eyes do I see love looking at me?
May be I'm crazy for believing
It's different this time
Oh am I ready to feel what I've dreamed about
Love that I've lived without finding is finding me
Heart, where are you takin' me?
What will you make of me? Is this the real thing?
And heart, could he be paradise?
'Cause in his eyes do I see love looking at me?
('Cause in his eyes I see)
Love looking at me
('Cause in his eyes I see)
Love looking at me
