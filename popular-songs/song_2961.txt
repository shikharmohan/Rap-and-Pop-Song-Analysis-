Love's the only thing I know in this life
That's cut me deeper than the sharpest knife
And once again here I am
And I'd pay any price for a new love
I still hurt for the one I lost
Standing here on a bridge that I can't get across
And I can't burn but I will
When I walk with a new love
And I believe
That it's gonna be better than ever before
That's why I'm looking for
A new love for this old heart
A new love and I just can't wait to start
I wanna feel that way again
Oh, when I find a new love
For this old heart of mine
Say and I'm looking for a new love
Somebody tell me where I find a new love
For this old heart of mine
Love's the only thing that's ever made me cry
Nothing's ever made me feel more alive
And that's why once again here I am
Looking for the eyes of a new love
I know that somewhere in this world tonight
There's a guy and I take a price, gonna trade on his plight
I'd even walk if I thought
I might find a new love
And I believe
That it's gonna be better than ever before
That's why I'm looking for
A new love for this old heart
A new love and I just can't wait to start
I wanna feel that way again
Oh, when I find a new love
For this old heart of mine
Say a new, new love
For this old heart of mine
I believe
That it's gonna be better than ever before
That's why I'm looking for
A new love for this old heart
A new love and I just can't wait to start
I wanna feel that way again
Oh, when I find a new love
For this old heart of mine
Oh I'm looking for a new love
For this old heart of mine
Say, I need a new love
For this old heart of mine
Oh I'm looking for a new love
Somebody tell me where I'll find
For this old heart of mine
