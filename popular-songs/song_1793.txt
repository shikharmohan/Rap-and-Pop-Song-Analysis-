I see your face, I look in your eyes
What you feel is no surprise
Everyone needs somethin' to believe in
Tell me your dreams, I'll tell you mine
In our hearts we'll look inside
And see all the colors of the rainbow, I know
We all want to believe in love
We all want to believe in something
Bigger than just us
We all want to be a part
Of the greater picture
That's hanging in our hearts, our hearts
Yeah, it's bigger than us
I want to see beyond my own little world
Grab your hand so we can twirl around the galaxy
See the world with clarity oh, oh
Oh, oh, we have such a long way to go
But I know we're getting closer every day
Every day!
We all want to believe in love
We all want to believe in something
Bigger than just us
We all want to be a part
Of the greater picture
That's hanging in our hearts, our hearts
Yeah, its bigger than us
It fills the universe
It lights the skies above
It rescues all our hearts
With love
L.O V E love, with love
L.O V E love
That's what's bigger than us
Bigger than us, come on!
It's love, it's love that's bigger than us
It's love, it's love that's bigger than us
It's love, it's love
It's love, it's love, it's love, it's love!
We all wanna believe in love
We all wanna believe in something
Bigger than just us
