Far away from it all
You and me with no one else around
A brand new start is all we need
It's all we need to mend these hearts
Back to the beginning
Be still, let it go
Before we lost hope
When we still touched
And love wasn't so hard
Be still, I already know
Foolish one with the smile
You don't have to be brave
Every time we fall down
But we're falling from grace
I'll gladly climb your walls
If you'll meet me halfway
Slow, slow it down
Why do we run?
We're missing so much, babe
Just lay in my arms for a while
Be still, we should've known
Foolish one with the smile
You don't have to be brave
I'll gladly climb your walls
If you'll meet me halfway
Every time we fall down
But we're falling from grace
Here's my hand and my heart
It's yours to take
Be still, be still, now
Be still, be still, be still
