A whisper away from changing everything
But is it safe to say such dangerous things?
And your hands are trembling
Girl, I'm weak in the knees
It's times like these
When silence means everything
More than anything
So fall when you're ready, babe
Let our kiss count the moments
And hearts set the pace
And I'll be your love song
And I'll love you right off your feet
Until you fall into me
Love ain't a race, there's no finish line
And I love a chance but don't leave me behind
'Cause, girl, we're both gambling
But I'm playing for keeps
It's times like these
When patience means everything
More than anything
So fall when you're ready, babe
Let our kiss count the moments
And hearts set the pace
And I'll be your love song
I'll love you right off your feet
And I'll fall for you every day
I'll cherish the moments, time can't erase
We'll be the love song
I promise you we're gonna sing
Girl, when you fall in me
Girl, when you fall in me
Come on, baby, fall into me, yeah
I'm waiting, fall into me, fall into me, fall into me
A whisper away from changing everything
