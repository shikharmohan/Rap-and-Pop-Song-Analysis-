When you walked up behind me and covered my eyes
And whispered in my ear, guess who?
Well I rattled off names like I really didn't know
But all along I knew it was you
And the longer we talked, the more we laughed
And wondered why we didn't last
It had been a long time, but later last night
Baby, we caught up real fast
And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is gonna work
All I know is you're sure looking good in my shirt
Ooh you look so good baby
You look good in my shirt
Well now I'm not saying that we solved overnight
Every way that we went wrong
Oh, but what I'm seeing I'd sure love seeing
Every morning from now on
And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is gonna work
All I know is you're sure looking good in my shirt
Ah you look so good
Maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is gonna work
All I know is you're sure looking
You look mighty good in my shirt
And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is gonna work
All I know is you're sure looking good in my shirt
You look good in my shirt, 1, 2, 3, 4
You look good in my shirt
