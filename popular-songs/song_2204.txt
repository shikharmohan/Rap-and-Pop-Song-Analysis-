I was your mine, you were mine, my enemy
You were mine, I was your, your enemy
You were mine, I was your, your enemy
You were mine, I was once your ene
You rang
Your ears rang
I was your mine, you were mine, my enemy
You were mine, I was your, your enemy
You were mine, I was your, your enemy
You were mine, I was once your ene
At night, wishful goddess
At night, wish the hardest
At night, disco goddess
At night, we're gonna go out
I was your mine, you were mine, my enemy
You were mine, I was your, your enemy
You were mine, I was your, your enemy
You were mine, I was once your ene
Wishful goddess
At night, wish the hardest
At night, wishful goddess
At night, wishful god
I was your mine, you were mine, my enemy
You were mine, I was your, your enemy
You were mine, I was your, your enemy
You were mine, I was, was your ene
At night, wishful goddess
At night, wish the hardest
At night, disco goddess
At night, she was so modest
At night, Crisco Loch Ness
At night, a mouthful omelet
At sight, a fish full of garbage
At night, the weasels go aah
