It was the thirty first gathering of the Thompsons, Joneses, and Smiths
There were tables full of chicken, taters, collard greens, and grits
Well, it all took place at Hatie Lake State Park
Volleyball, fishin', badmitton, yard darts
Aunt Irene said she'd never seen a turnout like this
Well, it started with hand shakes and lordy, how the babies have grown
As the sun got hotter the day got to draggin' along
I saw Uncle Gene comin' back from his car
With somethin' clear as water in a mason jar
The lemonade got hearty and, lordy, the party was on
That ol' boom box got louder and louder
Actin' civilzed didn't seem to matter
Everybody got to showin' their honey includin' me
Lord, I'd never known granny to take her a sip
But the words were a slurrin' comin' off of her lips
And it dawned on me, white lightnin' hit the family tree
Well, cousin Johnny was a gator, Jimmy was a UT fan
And that football talk was quickly gettin' out of hand
And granny told Uncle Dave that she hated his guts
Got right up in his face said, your whole famn damily's nuts
Chicken legs got to flyin' and the whoop started hittin' the fan
Yeah, that ol' boom box got louder and louder
Actin' civilzed didn't seem to matter
Everybody got to showin' their honey includin' me
Lord, I'd never known granny to take her a sip
But the words were a slurrin' comin' off of her lips
And it dawned on me, white lightnin' hit the family tree
Well, that ol' park ranger jumped out of his car
Said, "Listen here folks, it's gone a little too far"
Tear it all down, pack it all up
Call it quits while there's still a little love
Yeah, I've never known granny to take her a sip
But the words were a slurrin' comin' off of her lips
And it dawned on me, white lightnin' hit the family tree
Yeah, it dawned on me, white lightnin' hit the family tree
Ohh, that day we had a good time, man
Take it home, yo
