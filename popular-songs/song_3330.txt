Ya You have now entered your girls phsyce

but something so thick well just an occupation will never be
and what she makin it sounds good like laraby
but she says she specialize in message therapy

I know what she did
suck dick all day and went kiss on your kids
now shes kissin on you
instead spittin she true
yet your lovin that she ballin but she twistin the crew
