Ah you know I just can't help it
Ah a bad habit, I'm hooked
He got me, I can't break it
One hit, can't quit, last sip, that's it
Quick fix, don't fall, withdraw, hell now
Can't put down the bottles
Tipsy got me throwed off
Tryin' not to stumble
Slurrin' words that mumble sayin'
Baby, baby, baby
Ya poison's got me up and down
Head spinnin' round and round
I'm goin' crazy, crazy, take me
Boy, you got that ghetto love
I just can't get enough
That's why I'm so addicted
I'm feindin' for ya baby
I really need it
So hit me up, you got that stuff I like
That's so so fine
Hit me one more time
I'm an addict, gotta have it baby
Go, go slow, slow, more
More, pour, pour
Oh, boy you got me wired
Hyper but I'm tired
Sweatin' hot like fire
I can't get enough I'm so addicted
Baby, baby, baby
Ya poison's got me up and down
Head spinnin' round and round
I'm goin' crazy, crazy, take me
Boy, you got that ghetto love
I just can't get enough
That's why, I'm so addicted
I'm feindin' for ya baby
I really need it
So hit me up, you got that stuff I like
That's so so fine
Hit me one more time
I'm an addict, gotta have it baby
Got my lights in my trunk
Let it glow, feel the bass
Let it bump, let it bump
Down here in the A
We can kick it wit my girls
We can kick it wit the boys
If u feel me make some noise
(Hit it)
One, two, three
Now you really got to get it
Fired up, fired up
Put ya hands up to the ceilin'
Higher, higher
If you wit me, let me see ya
Lighters, lighters
'Cause you really got me feindin' bad
One more hit, I need it bad
I'm so addicted
I'm feindin' for ya baby
I really need it
So hit me up, you got that stuff I like
That's so so fine
Hit me one more time
I'm an addict, gotta have it baby
I'm so addicted
I'm feindin' for ya baby
I really need it
So hit me up, you got that stuff I like
That's so so fine
Hit me one more time
I'm an addict, gotta have it baby
