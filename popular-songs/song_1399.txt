Last night I think, I put that home fire out
Came in late and lit to a cold dark house
I guess she thinks, she's got me good this time
She took all of hers and most of mine
She left me high but I ain't dry
Well, I've got beer and tears to cry
Well, I should be feelin' low
Up that creek that we all know
Yeah, that woman left me high but I ain't dry
Say, "Hey bartender fill 'er up again
Let's just keep me in the shape I'm in
And if I can't get her memory to drown
Well, I'll take it for a swim all over town"
She left me high but I ain't dry
Well, I've got beer and tears to cry
Well, I should be feelin' low
Up that creek that we all know
Yeah, that woman left me high but I ain't dry
Well, I should be feelin' low
Up that creek that we all know
Yeah, that woman left me high but I ain't dry
