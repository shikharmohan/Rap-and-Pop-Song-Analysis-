(royce porter, bucky jones)
Use to be (use to be)
Love was mean to me
Every love I tried my heart cried that won't do
Now you see (now you see)
Love's been good to me I guess my love was waiting just for you
You and me (you and me) (you and me)
Go so well as we
Fit right to a t
Can't you see we do
Chorus:
Gotta say (gotta say) (gotta say)
Your love's got a way
Of making me glad
I waited just for you
I should have known
That my heart could not be wrong
Repeat chorus 4 times
