This feels so good
B. Cox, Omarion
In the beginnin', we were supposed to be temporary
But you put that thing on me, they tryna explain to me
That I should just let it be 'cause I'm lookin' crazy
But I can't be concerned with that, I'm tryna get it again
I'm not that hard, you pull my card
Girl, I'm tryna kick the habit, I'm an addict
I can't let you go, even though I know
That you're not one for me, it ain't good for me
I just can't let you go
You got a man but you all up on me
And I know I should let it go, you knockin' at my door
And put the blame on me when you're talkin' to your homies
Now I ain't concerned with that, I'm tryna get it again
I'm not that hard, you pull my card
Girl, I'm tryna kick the habit, I'm an addict
I can't let you go, even though I know
That you're not one for me, it ain't good for me
I just can't let you go
Let it go
Just can't let you go
Omarion
I'm not that hard, you pull my card
Girl, I'm tryna kick the habit, I'm an addict
I can't let you go, even though I know
That you're not one for me, it ain't good for me
I just can't let you go
Just can't let you go
