Feel like she loves me
she loves me
and then she loves me not
she loves me not
feel like she loves me
she loves me
and then she loves me not
she loves me not
then she loves me not
[Verse 1]
Hey, I know that this aint nothing that you used to
out of the ordinary, unusual
I know you had your whole life planed out
so to watch this pan out I know this shit gotta confuse you
I know you wonder why i had to choose you
then wanna take you for granted or abuse you
so I'mma keep it honest
I think it's a little ironic
if I hit another chick its gonna bruise you
shit, staring out the window of this plane
thinking if it crash, I'll never see your ass again
wouldnt that be a shame
cause look at all the shit we overcame
made it through the falme and never got cremated
I made it to the fame and never got too jaded
all them other couples we f-ck with, secretly hated
flash forward it's been year, we're the only ones that made it
sh-t remember I was straying from home
and where I wanna be was my favourite song
sometimes I still be on my Donnell Jones
but I just can't leave you alone
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
she know me like a book, its too easy to read my ass
unhappy stressed, yelling don't mislead my ass
I mean I make it so easy don't please my ass
the shoe was on the other foot and you would leave my ass
its true that, true that
my song all on the radio
Who Dat!
am i so far gone, used to see both sides like the Mohawk on
now I know you wonder why this phone lock on
all this time I've been with ya you aint used to do that
I loved you ass way before I knew you could wrap
the way you breaking my heart i should sue you for that
calling my uncles and my cousins have them do you for that
we had a deal you aint keeping up your end of the shit
in my mind I know she got the short end of the stick
trying justify it, man we finna be rich
and some bad b-tch I barely know sending me flix
[Chorus]
