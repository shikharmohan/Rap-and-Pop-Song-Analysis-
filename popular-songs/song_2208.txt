Come on people now, smile on your brother
Everybody get together, try to love one another right now
When I was an alien
Cultures weren't opinions
Gotta find a way, find a way when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, better wait
Never met a wise man
If so it's a woman
Gotta find a way to find a way when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I better wait
Gotta find a way to find a way when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I better wait
Just because you're paranoid
Don't mean they're not after you
Gotta find a way to find a way when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I better wait
Gotta find a way to find a way when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I better wait
Gotta find a way to find a way when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I better wait
