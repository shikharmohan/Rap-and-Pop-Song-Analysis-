Well i bet you wonder why
messages that you try, to send her like after nine
lately she just don't reply
you try to call but no, it's straight voicemail you go
and you don't hear her ringtone
till the sun hit your window
You wanna know where she been,
she said baby stop playing
claims she was with her girlfriend 
but six in the morning she getting home
you wanna know where was she
she saying don't you trust me?
situation is ugly, so pay attention, player listen
sorry that you have to be hearing all this from me
she find out you was creeping,
hello my name is revenge
all them numbers in your phone
but now she got some of her own
she found out you was creeping, hello my name is revenge
Oh Oh Oh Oh-Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh-Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Hello my name is revenge
Oh oh oh oh-Oh
oh oh oh oh-Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Hello my name is revenge
Well it certainly took you long to see what's been going on
You was so busy doing you
didn't notice her doin' what she do
You wanna be mad at me, player how could you be?
Gotta pay the carts you dealt, you brought this on yourself
You wanna know where she been,
she said baby stop playing
claims she was with her girlfriend 
but six in the morning she getting home
you wanna know where was she
she saying don't you trust me?
situation is ugly so pay attention player listen
