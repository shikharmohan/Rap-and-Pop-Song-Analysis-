Monkey see, monkey do
I don't know why I
Walk around, follow you
I don't know why I
Throw it out, keep it in
I don't know why I
Have to have poison skin
I don't know why I
Pay, pay to play
Pay to play
Pay to play
Walk an inch, take a mile
I don't know why I
Never faded, never smiled
I don't know why I
Never mind, eat and run
I don't know why I
Monkey ass mother fuck
I don't know why I
Pay, pay to play
Pay to play
Pay to play
I don't know why I
I don't know why I
Pay, pay to play
Pay to play
Pay to play
Monkey see, monkey do
I don't know why I
Walk around, follow you
I don't know why I
Throw it out, keep it in
I don't know why I
Have to have poison skin
I don't know why I
Pay, pay to play
Pay to play
Pay to play
I don't know why I
I don't know why I
Pay, pay to play
Pay to play
Pay to play
Pay to play
Pay to play
Pay to play
