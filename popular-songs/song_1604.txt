It's Miley Cyrus, teen pop sensation!!
We go on the danceflo' tonight
[Verse 1]
I don't have nobody with me now,
So baby, am I right or wrong?
I wanna kick the ball around, so kipow!
Unless you wanna sing me a song
Yeah
[Chorus:]
Don't pout, don't pout
This is what it's all about
Don't pout, don't pout
Even though I'm always around
So don't you pout
[Verse 2]
I don't wanna date, so don't try and ask me
Cuz that's how I am and how I wanna be
Since you came along, you singin' a song
Even though I have no money, it's still find!
[Chorus:]
Don't pout, don't pout
This is what it's all about
Don't pout, don't pout
Even though I'm always around
So don't you pout
[Bridge]
Even though I don't wanna you to come, it's a bang bang bang bang!
And even though you wanna act like this, it's a little bit of love
[Chorus:]
Don't pout, don't pout
This is what it's all about
Don't pout, don't pout
Even though I'm always around
So don't you pout
[Chorus:]
Don't pout, don't pout
This is what it's all about
Don't pout, don't pout
Even though I'm always around
So don't you pout
