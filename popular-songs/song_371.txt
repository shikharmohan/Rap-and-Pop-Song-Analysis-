Everytime I hear that whistle whine
From a lonesome locomotive comin' down the line
It carries my mind away to another place in time
When train travelin' across the land was the only way to fly
Am I a fool to think it glamorous
Box-carrin' like a hobo, it must have been rough
But a simpler way of life is what it really means to me
When we weren't so dependent on money to bee free
I hear you train, are you travelin' my way
Won't you let me ride your rails right back to yesterday
Who knows what I could see from that old time machine
But there you go again train travelin'
There you go again train travelin'
I'm lyin' on a rotten wooden floor
Smell yesterday's whiskey here rattlin' at the door
Railroad man lookin' for me I'm scared as I can be
I open my eyes and realize its just another dream
I hear you train, are you travelin' my way
Won't you let me ride your rails right back to yesterday
Who knows what I could see from that old time machine
But there you go again train travelin'
There you go again train travelin'
There you go again train travelin'
