[Verse 1]
We're a hurricane
So destructive in the way that we do
A little bit insane
But she loves it just the same
And me too
[Pre-Chorus]
They say love and insanity
Are somewhat related
The way that they make us act
But baby girl the love between you and me
Is truly the greatest
Though sometimes we hate it
[Chorus]
They can't tell me nothing about you
Cuz you're my 
Crazy love
Can't tell me nothing about how we do
Cuz we got
Crazy love
[Verse 2]
I'm intelligent
I'm not stupid
Not at all
But my common sense
When it comes to you it falls
Then I do something dumb
[Pre-Chorus]
They say love and insanity
Are somewhat related
The way that they make us act
But baby girl the love between you and me
Is truly the greatest
Though sometimes we hate it
[Chorus]
They can't tell me nothing about you
Cuz you're my 
Crazy love
Can't tell me nothing about how we do
Cuz we got
Crazy love
[Fabolous]
I walk into where you was at then my phone calls get a who is that
I told her that i worry that we won't last
She told me you need to worry when i don't ask
See that's the crazy love i be talking bout
Gary Coleman face girl what you talking bout
Make me wanna kick you and that yorkie out
Then i see that fat ass when you walking out
How I'm gonna tell my baby bye-bye
Outfit look crazy on her you my lady gaga
But you wanna start at first and get the last word
You wanna lock me down and get the password
Damn i wanna spray don't use juice
So in the bedroom i got a few screws loose
The head's coo-coo back-shots psycho
Hit it from the back hard hope you got Geico
[Chorus]
They can't tell me nothing about you
Cuz you're my 
Crazy love
Can't tell me nothing about how we do
Cuz we got
Crazy love
