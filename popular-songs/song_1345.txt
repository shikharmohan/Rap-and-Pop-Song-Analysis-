Louder, louder, the voices in my head
Whispers taunting, all the things you said
Faster the days go by and I'm still
Stuck in this moment of wanting you here
Time in the blink of an eye
You held my hand, you held me tight
Now you're gone and I'm still crying
Shocked, broken, I'm dying inside
Where are you? I need you
Don't leave me here on my own
Speak to me, be near me
I can't survive unless I know you're with me
Shadows linger only to my eye
I see you, I feel you, don't leave my side
It's not fair, just when I found my world
They took you, they broke you, they tore out your heart
I miss you, you hurt me, you left with a smile
Mistaken, your sadness was hiding inside
Now all that's left are the pieces to find
The mystery you kept, the soul behind a guise
Where are you? I need you
Don't leave me here on my own
Speak to me, be near me
I can't survive unless I know you're with me
Why did you go?
All these questions run through my mind
I wish I couldn't feel at all
Let me be numb, I'm starting to fall
Where are you? I need you
Don't leave me here on my own
Speak to me, be near me
I can't survive unless I know you're with me
  (Where are you?)
Where are you? I need you
Don't leave me here on my own
Where are you?
(I can't survive unless I know you're with me)
You were smiling
You were smiling
You were smiling
