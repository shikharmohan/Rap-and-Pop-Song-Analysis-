Only just a friend, the love story begins
Now here's a happy ending to believe in
You're always there for me, now you're with me in my dreams
It's got me wondering if you ever dream of me
I don't wanna risk losing everything
But I'll take the chance and tell you what I'm thinking
Girl, you've been my best friend, can we put this to bed then?
Tonight's the night to cross the line, baby won't you be mine?
Not just my homegirl, time that I take you home, girl
Tonight's the night to cross the line, let me love you tonight
I, I, I
Kiss, kiss, kiss me on my lips
We've been dancing 'round the moment now we're doin' it
Then breathe, breathe a sigh your sweet relief
We've been holding it so long the wait was killing me
Oh, and we are what we have been waiting for
So baby open your mind while I close the door
Girl, you've been my best friend, can we put this to bed then?
Tonight's the night to cross the line, baby won't you be mine?
Not just my homegirl, time that I take you home, girl
Tonight's the night to cross the line, let me love you tonight
I, I, I
Don't let this moment just slip away
'Cause we'll never know unless we try someday
If you're ready I'm so ready
Tonight's the night, tonight's the night
Oh, girl you've been my best friend, can we put this to bed then?
Tonight's the night to cross the line, baby won't you be mine?
Not just my homegirl, time that I take you home, girl
Tonight's the night to cross the line, let me love you tonight
I, I, I, I, I, I
