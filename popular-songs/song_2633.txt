I found verity on Nolan's Avenue
Down where the air is thick as L.A. skies are blue
The water tried to break it down but it held through
It gave a little for the sake of staying true
We cut ties, we tell lies, we hate change
And we wanna claim where we feel
We take toes, we rake yours, yeah, we dig holes
And we're digging right in your fears
We're waking up, we're waking up
And right on time, and right on time
We'll take these roads, we'll break them up
And right on time, and right on time
We got cars, we write laws, we won't pause
Don't you know we're always working this hard?
We don't lose, we might bruise, yeah
But we'll rain fire on you till you're playing all of your cards
We're waking up, we're waking up
And right on time, and right on time
We'll take these roads, we'll break them up
And right on time, and right on time
On time, right on time
Waking up, waking up, yeah
Ooh, oh, ooh
