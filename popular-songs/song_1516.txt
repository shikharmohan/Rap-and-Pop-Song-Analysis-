Now the Bible tells the story 'bout Adam's rib
How the Lord made a woman for companionship
And the first thing she did was take a bite of that forbidden fruit
Well, I guess we'll be paying till the end of time
At least it is how it is with that woman of mine
Oh Lord, I think I want my rib back
Now this is wrong and baby, that ain't right
And I'm working tryin' to please that woman day and night
She's never satisfied although I try to do the best that I can
That she's gotta change or honey, I'm gonna leave
I won't let evolution gonna make a monkey out of me
Oh Lord, I think I want my rib back
There's been a hole in wallet and a pain in my side
Ever since I made that girl my blushing bride
Her daddy calls her Angel and her momma calls her three times a night
Her cousin's on my sofa, her sister's got my car
Her brothers drink my liquor like my house was a bar
Oh Lord, well, I think I want my rib back
Well, now this is wrong and baby, that ain't right
And I'm working tryin' to please that woman day and night
She's never satisfied although I try to do the best that I can
That she's gotta change or honey, I'm gonna leave
I won't let evolution gonna make a monkey out of me
Oh Lord, I think I want my rib back
Oh Lord, I think I want my rib back
