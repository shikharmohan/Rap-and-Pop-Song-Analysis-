She married when she was twenty, she thought she was ready
Now she's not so sure, she thought she'd done some living
But now she's just wonderin', what she's living for
Now she's feeling that there's something more
Is there life out there? So much she hasn't done
Is there life beyond her family and her home?
She's done what she should, should she do what she dares?
She doesn't want to leave, she's just wonderin' is there life out there
She's always lived for tomorrow
She's never learned how to live for today, she's dyin' to try
Something foolish do something crazy or just get away
Something for herself for a change
Is there life out there? So much she hasn't done
Is there life beyond her family and her home?
She's done what she should, should she do what she dares?
She doesn't want to leave, she's just wonderin' is there life out there
There's a place in the sun that she's never been
Where life is fair and time is a friend
Would she do it the same as she did back then?
She looks out her window and wonders again
Is there life out there? So much she hasn't done
Is there life beyond her family and her home?
She's done what she should, should she do what she dares?
She doesn't want to leave, she's just wonderin' is there life out there
Is there life out there?
Is there life out there? So much she hasn't done
Is there life beyond her family and her home?
She's done what she should, should she do what she dares?
She doesn't want to leave, she's just wonderin' is there life out there
She doesn't want to leave, she's just wonderin' is there life out there
