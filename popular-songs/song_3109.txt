Oooh Oooh Ooooooohhhhhhh Ohhhhh
Can you feel me
When I think about you
With every breath I take
Every minute
No matter what I do
My world is an empty place
Like I've been wonderin the desert
For a thousand days ( Ohhh )
Don't know if it's a mirage
But I always see your faaaaaaace, baby
I'm missing you so much
Can't help it, I'm in love 
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without raaaaaain
Oooohhhhhhh, Wooaaah wooaah wooaah
The stars are burning
I hear your voice in my mind ( Voice In My Mind )
Can't you hear me calling
My heart is yearning
Like the ocean that's running dry
Catch me I'm falling
It's like the ground is crumbling underneath my feet
Won't you save me
There's gonna be a monsoon
When you get back to me
Ohhhh baabyyyy
I'm missing you so much
Can't help it, I'm in love (love) 
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side (side)
Don't know how I will survive
A day without you is like a year without raaaaaain
Ohohouh, Wooaaah wooaah wooaah
So let this drought come to an end
And may this desert flower again
And I need you here 
I cannot explian 
The day without you
It's like a year without raaaaain
Ooooohhh
I'm missing you so much (much)
Can't help it, I'm in love  
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side (side)
Don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain
Ohhohoh, Woooaaahh woaahh
Ooohh, Ooooooooouuhh
