I don't think you'll like it, I hear that city's cold
And the people are much warmer, two good reasons not to go
You fight traffic all day long then you gotta pay to park
You have to go around locking all your doors there after dark
Don't know why you feel you gotta go somewhere
Have you ever thought about just staying here?
If you let me I can give you don't you know
Every reason not to go
Their football team is lousy no matter what they do
You can bet come Sunday they'll find a way to lose
You'll hate the way the smoke and the buildings block the sky
Got the prices jacked so high takes a million to get by
Don't know why you feel you gotta go somewhere
Have you ever thought about just staying here?
If you let me I can give you don't you know
Every reason not to go
There must be something in this town
You'd be missing if you move
'Cause I know if you were around I'd be missing you
Don't know why you feel you gotta go somewhere
Have you ever thought about just staying here?
I'm in love with you
And baby, now you know every reason not to go
Every reason not to go, baby, please don't go
