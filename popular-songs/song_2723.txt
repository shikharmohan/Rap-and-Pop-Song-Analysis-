Now, I've never been in with the fast crowd
I've never been closer than just a little over the line
I know those nights, I'd find great temptations
I go home to bed alone, pull the covers up over my mind
I let it go by and said I'd save my feelings
But until I met you, I hardly used them at all
I should say, no, oh whoa, I don't want to
Honey you will be the first one to watch this angel fall
So, you can take the wings off me
Lay them down so carefully
Hold me close tonight, you'll see
I am yours and you can take the wings off me
Oh, you can take the wings off me
Oh, lay them down so carefully
Oh, I should say, no, oh whoa, I don't want to
I am yours and you can take the wings off me
