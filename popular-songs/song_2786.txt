I'm rolling, I'm tumbling, I'm falling apart
'Cause I'll never, no I'll never find love
In his runaway heart
He's a fast rushing river I can't get across
Like an ocean of sadness over which I am tossed
He never slows down, he's always ready to fly
And when I get next to you it's just 'Hello, hello and goodbye'
I'm rolling, I'm tumbling, I'm falling apart
'Cause I'll never, no I'll never find love
In his runaway heart
No rope can hold him, he's not fit to be tied
Like the wildest of horses nobody can ride
Freedom's his distance and the means to his end
So I'm giving up trying 'cause I'm just chasing, chasing the wind
I'm rolling, I'm tumbling, I'm falling apart
'Cause I'll never, no I'll never find love
In his runaway heart
In his runaway heart
