The sun is shining down
There's not one cloud around
Morning hits me
Where I lay
Everything was green
A perfect day it seems
Yeah, he's got everything his way
Oh, but I've seen better days
I've seen better days
When the rain was pouring down
And he had his loving arms
Wrapped around me
I've seen better days
The neighbors come and go
They smile and wave, hello
And all the kids are out to play
Lollipops and good times
They look so much like mine
But he has taken mine away
Oh, and I've seen better days
Lord, I've seen better days
When the rain was pouring down
And he had his loving arms
Wrapped around me
I've seen better days
Oh Lord, I miss 'em
I've seen better days
