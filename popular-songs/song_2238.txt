You're my favorite of my saviors
You're my favorite, oh no
You're my favorite of my favors
You're my razor, oh no
Hey, and the situation wasn't quite as intense as I thought
I need you around to remind me when not to be calm
And the situation wasn't quite as intense as I thought
I need you around to remind me when not to be calm
Calm, calm, calm
You're my favorite of my saviors
You're my favorite, oh no
You're my favorite of my favors
You're my razor, oh no
Hey, and the situation wasn't quite as intense as I thought
I need you around to remind me when not to be calm
And the situation wasn't quite as intense as I thought
I need you around to remind me when not to be calm
Calm, calm, calm
You're my favorite of my saviors
You're my favorite, oh no
You're my favorite of my favors
You're my razor, oh no
Hey, and the situation wasn't quite as intense as I thought
I need you around to remind me when not to be calm
And the situation wasn't quite as intense as I thought
I need you around to remind me when not to be calm
Calm, calm, calm
