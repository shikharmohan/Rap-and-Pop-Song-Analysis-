Hey, my third floor stuck on a hoodrat charm
Cut, take boy, Hollyhood act charm
Short tennis skirt, now she got me in the zone
Tattoo, tight broach, bump the low ring tone
Then the ghetto booty, play the ghetto booty on her
Roll up our cuties, don't smoke Arizona
One night stand, one night with the clan
One night, one time broke her off ten grand
Project all the way, gutter all day

Three stories while them hoodrats play
