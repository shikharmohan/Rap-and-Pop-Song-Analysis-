What Up Sit Up Get Up Wit Us Killas
Enough Niggas To Crush Ya Luck And Bust Ya Guts And Liver
Hit With The Rigor Now Ya Livin Off In The River
Watchin This Arsinist While I Spark A Bit Of My Heart
And Embark Imma Start The Shit
Welcome To The Bottomless Pit
Animalistic I Know Its Hella Dark In There
My World Is Not Like A Regular Life
We Tote Big Guns Instead Of A Knife
Hella Grim Nite The Devil Is In Flight
He Said A Buretta Would Get Whatever's In Sight
You Got a Job, I Aint Got One
You Got a Wad, I Gotta Shotgun
You Got a Guard, I Got Squad
You Here To Work Im Here To Rob!
