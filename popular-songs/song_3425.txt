They wouldn't let him play the opry
With whiskey on his breath
And it didn't take 'em long
To figure out what they missed
He went down that lost highway
Underneath that purple sky
A legend disappeared
Before his time
Things change
(Change)
They said, he was the Devil
Dressed in gold leme
The way he shook his hips
Out there on that stage
But before that faithful day
He left Tennessee
All of them were
Callin' him the King
Things change
(Things change)
Well they like to call them hippies
Outlaws with guitars
But they brought a little poetry
To the honky tonks and bars
They might've got a little too crazy
They might have flew a little too high
Somewhere somebody's playin'
Their song tonight
(Things change)
Don't you know things change
(Things change)
Some say, it's too country
Some say, it's too rock 'n' roll
But it's just good music
If you can feel it in your soul
And it doesn't really matter
It's always been the same
Life goes on
Things change
(Things change)
Things change
  (Things change)
Don't you know they change
(Things change)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Things change)
They can keep me from change
  (Things change
(Things change)
Keep on, keep on, keep on changing
  (Things change)
'Cause things change
  (Things change)
