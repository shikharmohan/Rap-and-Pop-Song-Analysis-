Where did you go when I woke up
You were gone
Find someone to replace you
I'll never be alone
I sit around so anxious
For you to call my phone
She went up to heaven
Said she'll be back later on
In love with an angel, she don't belong to me
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
In love with an angel, she don't belong to me
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
In love with an angel, she don't belong to me
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
In love with an angel
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
And I just can't chase the clouds
Out of my mind
She's the cause of my heart ache
But I, I'll be fine
'Cause when we kiss there's no playin' around
There's no time
In love with an angel, she don't belong to me
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
In love with an angel, she don't belong to me
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
In love with an angel, she don't belong to me
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
In love with an angel
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
In love with an angel, she don't belong to me
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
In love with an angel, she don't belong to me
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
In love with an angel, she don't belong to me
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
In love with an angel
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
In love with an angel
In love with an angel
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
In love with an angel
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
In love with an angel
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
