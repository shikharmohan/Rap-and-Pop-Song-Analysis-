I know you may not want to see me
On your way down from the clouds
Would you hear me if I told you
That my heart is with you now
She's only happy in the sun
She's only happy in the sun
Did you find what you were after
The pain and the laughter brought you to your knees
But if the sun sets you free
Sets you free
You'll be free indeed
Indeed
She's only happy in the sun
She's only happy in the sun
Every time I hear you laughing
Hear you laughing
It makes me cry
Like a story of life
Of life
Is hello goodbye
She's only happy in the sun
She's only happy in the sun
She's only happy in the sun
She's only happy in the sun
