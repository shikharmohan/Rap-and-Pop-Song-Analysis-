Sometimes I get angry
and feelin' sorry for myself
I worry myself crazy 'til I can't catch my breath
I see life as a struggle
And answers hard to find
and trouble's weighin heavy on my mind
'Til beautiful you starts smilin '
Laugh until you cry
And even if I'm trying 
I can't help laughin' at myself
I don't know how you do it
Like there's nothin' to it
When I look up and there ain't nothin' left 
but beautiful you.
Sometimes when I ask you
What do you stay here for
I know we need each other
But it seems I need you more
You act like you don't hear me
You don't even make a sound
And I hold my breath until you turn around
And beautiful you starts smilin'
Laugh until you cry
And even if I'm trying 
I can't help laughin at myself
I don't know how you do it
Like there's nothin' to it
When I look up and there ain't nothin' left
But beautiful you
You don't even see it
You swear you can't believe it
But you're beautiful
Beautiful
I don't know how you do it
Like there's nothin' to it
and sometimes I have to pinch myself
When I look up and there ain't nothin' left
But beautiful you
beautiful you
