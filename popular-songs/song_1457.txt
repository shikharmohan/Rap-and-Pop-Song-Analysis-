Ordinary no, really don't think so
Not a love this true
Common destiny, we were meant to be
Me and you
Like a perfect scene from a movie screen
We're a dream come true
Suited perfectly for eternity
Me and you
Everyday, I need you even more
And the night time too
There's no way I could ever let you go
Even if I wanted to
Everyday I live, try my best to give
All I have to you
Thank the stars above that we share this love
Me and you
Everyday, I need you even more
And the night time too
There's no way I could ever let you go
Even if I wanted to
Ordinary no, I really don't think so
Just a precious few
Ever make it last, get as lucky as
Me and you
Me and you
