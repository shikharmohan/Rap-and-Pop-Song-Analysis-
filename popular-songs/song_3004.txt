I thought love was meant to last forever
Isn't that how love's supposed to be?
Now it seems the good times are all over
It's so funny, I guess, the joke's on me
Every day, I sit alone and wonder
Why I fell in love so easily
And then woke up to find that all he left behind
Were tattered dreams and broken pieces in my memory
So tell me what's so good about goodbye?
What's so good about watching good love die?
He's the kind you can't forget
So I won't even try
Tell me, what's so good?
I gave him all I could
Tell me, what's so good about goodbye?
I don't think, I'll ever love another
I didn't know goodbye could hurt so bad
I know, I'll always find, he's somewhere in my mind
Still believe the worst of him's the best I'll ever have
So tell me what's so good about goodbye?
What's so good about watching good love die?
He's the kind you can't forget
So I won't even try
Tell me, what's so good?
I gave him all I could
Tell me, what's so good about goodbye?
