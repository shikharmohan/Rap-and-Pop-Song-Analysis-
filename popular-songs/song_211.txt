Ciara:

I just wanna be wherever you are
And I will love you, baby
Sun or rain
And I just wanna let you know 
I'll always be down (down)
Oh,
I I I, I just wanna make you feel good
And I just wanna love you like you deserve
You'll never, ever need for another girl
I'd need an extra day on the week
An extra hour on the clock
Just to show you how beautiful you are
You're so good to me 
Boy, you're so good to me
Oh yeah, I'd need an extra month on the year
One extra holiday
just to kiss you all over your face
You're so good to me
Boy, you're so good to me
You got me
I'm Speechless (Oh, oh, oh)
I-I-I'm Speechless (Oh, oh, oh)
Ahhh, You got me speechless (Oh, oh, oh)
I'm Speechless (Oh, oh, oh)

(Verse 2)
Baby I, I
wanna be the girl that gives you everything
My whole heart, every piece, every part of me
And I'm gon' do my best
to make sure that you never leave
And boy, you do your best
cause you're the reason that I breathe
And sometimes we gon' fight
but at the end of the night I humble myself
baby, we're alright
Make sure that we're tight
Your love is my muse
No more will I have to choose
You're my number one, there's no number two
I'd need an extra day on the week
An extra hour on the clock
Just to show you how beautiful you are
You're so good to me 
Boy, you're so good to me
Oh, yeah...I'd need an extra month on the year
One extra holiday
Just to kiss you all over your face
You're so good to me...
You're so good to me.
You got me
I'm Speechless (Oh, oh, oh)
I-I-I'm Speechless (Oh, oh, oh)
Ahhh. You got me speechless (Oh, oh, oh)
I'm Speechless (Oh, oh, oh)
I'm Speechless (Oh, oh, oh)
I-I-I'm Speechless (Oh, oh, oh)
Ahhh. You got me speechless (Oh, oh, oh)
I'm Speechless (Oh, oh, oh)
Ohhhh
(Bridge)
Baby, I'm thankful for all the days 
you've had my back (back)
Could've been anywhere in the world
but look where you're at (at)
You're loyal to me
it's me and you against the world
And I'm loyal to you
I will always be your girl (uh-huh)
I'll be wrong with you (uh-huh)
I'll be right with you (uh-huh)
So just take us both
You hurt him, you hurt me too
I need an extra day on the week
An extra hour on the clock
Just to show you how beautiful you are
You're so good to me
Boy you're so good to me, hey
I'd need an extra month in the year
One extra holiday
Just to kiss you all over your face
So good to me
You've been so good to me
So good...
