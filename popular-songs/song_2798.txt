You come to me just as a friend
'Cause you're looking for someone's shoulder you can cry on
Well, she broke your heart, now it's the end
And you say that you've got an aching heart
Like the world has never known
But baby, what do you know about heartache?
What do you know about pain?
What do you know about the sleepless nights
And walking alone in the rain?
What do you know about crying?
What do you know about being blue?
When you don't even know about the love I feel for you
You say I may not understand
How it feels to see your love in the arms of another
But you don't know the many times
That I had to hide all my tears inside
When I saw you with your lover
But baby, what do you know about heartache?
What do you know about pain?
What do you know about the sleepless nights
And walking alone in the rain?
What do you know about crying?
What do you know about being blue?
When you don't even know about the love I feel for you
When you don't even know about the love that I feel for you
But baby, what do you know about heartache?
What do you know about pain?
What do you know about the sleepless nights
And walking alone in the rain?
What do you know about crying?
What do you know about being blue?
When you don't even know about the love I feel for you
