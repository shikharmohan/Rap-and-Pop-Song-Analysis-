I fell by the wayside
I fell on my knees
Cryin', "Why was I so hard to please?"
I stood at the crossroads
Took a long look at me
Sometimes you don't know where
You're from 'til you leave
And I've been out there searching
For a place where I belong
And on my way, I heard my song
Let it sing me home
Sun on my shoulders
And the wind at my back
Bound and determined
To get back on track
To where the heart is
Where it's been all along
Sometimes you don't know you've
Got 'til it's gone, gone, gone, gone
And I've been out there searching
For a place where I belong
And on my way, I heard my song
Let it sing me home
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And I've been out there searching
For a place where I belong
And on my way I heard my song
Let it sing me home
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
