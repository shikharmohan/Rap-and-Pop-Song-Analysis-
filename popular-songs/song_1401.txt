I was lost in the wild side of life
I was blinded by smoke and neon lights
I was drinkin', sinkin' without a prayer
Then she showed up right out of thin air
She took me to Heaven, oh my Lord, what a ride
And I've never been higher, on her love I could fly
I was hell bound, on my way down, then I found the one I need
Oh, an angel loved the devil out of me
I thank God for her love each day
He saved me when he sent her my way
Now each night I drive by those neon lights
And go home to my own paradise
Where she takes me to Heaven, oh my Lord, what a ride
And I've never been higher, on her love I could fly
I was hell bound, on my way down, then I found the one I need
Oh, an angel loved the devil out of me
Oh yes she did
Yeah, an angel loved the devil out of me
