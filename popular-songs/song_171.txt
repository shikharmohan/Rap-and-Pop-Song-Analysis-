Always be momma's baby
Always be daddy's girl
Right now she's makin' 'em crazy
Little red riding hood, big bad world
She ain't waitin' on 21 candles
She ain't missin' not a minute of fun
She ain't worried about one day older
Pretty little rebel on the run
She ain't tryin' to be hard to handle
She gonna do what a girl gonna do
She ain't waitin' on 21 candles
Sure ain't gonna wait on you
Can't be innocent forever
Ain't never done anything
She'll tell you no but she don't mean never
Turned the corner when she turned 18
She ain't waitin' on 21 candles
She ain't missin' not a minute of fun
She ain't worried about one day older
Pretty little rebel on the run
She ain't tryin' to be hard to handle
She gonna do what a girl gonna do
She ain't waitin' on 21 candles
Sure ain't gonna wait on you
Her folks wanna hold her back
But they don't know how
She wants it all and she wants it all right now
Get it all before the sun goes down
She ain't waitin', she aint' missin'
She ain't worryin', that girl needs kissin'
She ain't waitin' on 21 candles
She ain't missin' not a minute of fun
She ain't worried about one day older
Pretty little rebel on the run
She ain't tryin' to be hard to handle
She gonna do what a girl gonna do
She ain't waitin' on 21 candles
Sure ain't gonna wait on you
Yeah, them 21 candles
