Now I know what you need
And you know what I need
The whole dang block knows this whole house needs
A love revival, love revival up in here
Now I know I'm preaching
'Cause I'm certainly not leaving
But it's time to get excited and the neighbors aren't invited
To this love revival, love revival up in here
So sit up and listen, boy 'cause I'm tired of being nice
Now momma's gonna tell you what she needs tonight
Revival, revival, well give me something soulful
Honey, all I need are your two arms around me again
So, if you're in this till the end
Then let the love revival begin
I feel the spirit, the spirit's moving
I feel the spirit moving
So, I pray you won't deny me
Now that I've said my peace
And I'll say it again, son
Just in case you were asleep
I want a love revival, love revival up in here
'Cause I know what you need
And you know what I need
The whole dang block knows this whole house needs
A love revival, love revival up in here
So sit up and listen, boy 'cause I'm tired of being' nice
Now momma's gonna tell you what she needs tonight
Revival, revival well give me something soulful
Honey, all I need are your two arms around me again
So, if you're in this till the end
Then let the love revival begin
Well, we're both in this till the end
So let the love revival begin
I feel the spirit, the spirit's moving
I feel the spirit, the spirit's moving
I feel the spirit, the spirit's moving
I feel the spirit, the spirit's moving
Revival, revival, well give me something soulful
Honey, all I need are your two arms around me again
So, if you're in this till the end
Then let the love revival begin
Revival, revival, well give me something soulful
Honey, all I need are your two arms around me again
So, if you're in this till the end
Then let the love revival begin
