Chorus [Krizz Kaliko]
I see shadows on the road again
wonder if they comin for my soul
I get trapped up in this mode I'm in
and will I every grow old
(and will i ever grow old)
Verse 1 [Tech N9ne]
I member, them high nights
on x we find sites, to climb heights
unheard to man we line white
molly up it had to be non flight
mix it with weed and wet its chronkite, that shits beyond hype
spittin somethin we be trippin and seeing some shit
its fuckin up the buzz of me and the clique
so we hop up in the whip and flee with the quick
but the shadow make us swerve and we on the strip
did you see the shit? (ye i saw the shit)
did ya'll see the shit? (ye we saw the shit)
all agree that a shadow was crossin the street
then immediately vanished we need a hit
Chorus [Krizz Kaliko]
I see shadows on the road again
wonder if they comin for my soul
I get trapped up in this mode I'm in
and will I ever grow old
(and will i ever grow old)
Verse 2 [Tech N9ne] 
Is it comin for me because of all the shit that i did in the past
was bad to people
mad and evil
if your the A.O.D im sad to meet you
angel of death when i quit doin ex
because of seeing you every night on the stretch
so ive been clean for three years
and counting still im seeing shadows will they scheme for me
to follow them into the pit of despair
punishment for what i did in this lair
what if evil spirits live in the road
to take the kindrid spirits crippled up souls
i dont know how the spirit thing goes
real or livin in my frontal lobe
will i be livin life until im old
or will i be takin by shadows on the road
Chorus [Krizz Kaliko]
I see shadows on the road again
wonder if they comin for my soul
I get trapped up in this mode I'm in
and will I every grow old
