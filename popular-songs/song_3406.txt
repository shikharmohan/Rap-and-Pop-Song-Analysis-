Sometimes I close my eyes
And imagine you're with me
Chasing passion into the night
All tangled in a dream
Oh if you could see my heart
The way I feel inside
You would know just how far
I'm willin' to go to get to you
There is nothin', I won't do
Show me what it's like to lose control
Free the desire in your soul
Ohh, let me love you
Let me take you to a place like nowhere else
Show you the things you never felt
Ohh, let me love you
Oh, I want to taste your kiss
Be the reason for your smile
Touch the magic on your skin
Be the one that drives you wild
Oh if you could read my mind
You'd know you're everything I need
You'd see yourself through my eyes
You'd understand what I'm goin' through
Just how much I want you
Show me what it's like to lose control
Free the desire in your soul
Ohh, let me love you
Let me take you to a place like nowhere else
Show you the things you never felt
Ohh, let me love you
Let me love you
Let me love you
Let me show you what it's like to lose control
Free the desire in your soul
Ohh, let me love you
Let me take you to a place like no where else
Show you the things you never felt
Ohh, let me love you
Let me show you what it's like to lose control
Free the desire in your soul
Ohh, let me love you
Let me take you to a place like no where else
Show you the things you never felt
Ohh, let me love you
Ohh, oh let me love you
Ohh, let me love you
