The spiked red hair...and the..and the, paintn' his face
Wha, hold on man, Tech is losein' it man
He's not as grounded as he used to be

You know you see a black dude with red hair
And a long beard, I mean look he look scary to me too

That is..that's he's doin' that for the white folks
That white shit he doin' man
[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]

Nineteen years oh so

Stop me, and then try ta tell me (Come gangsta)
And then compare me to Nelly (What ya bang bra)
So this songs is gonna tell me ??
Hey, I've been bustin'
And fizz knuckin' bitches
It tizz nothin' for years puffin'
I've been clutchin' riches from his muffin'
Heres fuck you niggaz this is toughin' I
(Don't know what the fuck you thinkin' tellin me this shit is hella fake)
Say, since way back in the days rappin'

And stage saggin'
Theys wackin' Nina stays layed backin' I
(Laugh at niggaz contantly they never know the money Nina makes)
Hey, this is amazin' how niggaz formulate they hatin'

Cause some gangstas want a head blast
Cause I run with the red rags
And try make the feds flash
Try to swipe my bread stash

Is what they sayin' to me
[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
I've been nice to you rapper cats for a long time
I left Kansas City so them other cats can gon shine
But it seems these punks are confussed because I'm my own kind
But I'm back on deck cause Kansas City is who's throne? Mine!
This ain't no punk shit
Nigga this is strength at it's finest
I made this shit so you all you sins can rewind it
Meaning, you pussys who says this Tech shit ain't hard for real
And try to disregard the real
You mutherfuckers is hard to feel
I get your death threats
Cause I'm the king bitch
Money, groupies, drugs, and alcohol 
And bling shit
But I stay a head of da game
And you punks is so lame
Cause my mobbin' gangsta track will demolish your whole tank [A screech of some kind]
I've been with every rapper who's legendary
Underground to mainstream know that Tech is very hard
Cause I bring the heater
Love me cause I'm your leader
Bitches they suck my peter
While I drinkin' Margaritas
Niggaz get layed down
Seven displayed sounds
N9ne the crayzed clown
Lines like sprayed rounds
This is for all you haters who don't bump my shit
If you say this ain't gangsta, you can suck my dick!
I might look like a clown
But you niggaz sound like a motherfuckin' circus
Fuck you motherfuckers!
[Outro: Yukmouth]
This nigga is the tightest nigga movin' man
I mean...Tech N9ne will demolish all you niggaz
From the stage show, to rockin' the mic you name it
Thats why I roll wit him he my favorite rapper real talk
Tech N9ne
