I can open doors all by myself
And I'm strong enough to face this world
Without anybody's help
But why, why would I want to?
Why would I, when you love me like you do?
I could go on living
Without tasting your kiss
Get by without this moment
You touching me like this, but why?
I could keep this feeling locked in my heart
I could bury these emotions and put up my guard
But why, why start resisting
Why, why? Look at all I'd be missing
I could go on leaving
Without tasting your kiss
Get by without this moment
You touching me like this
But why would I do that?
I'd have to be crazy
To give up all you give me
What you do to me, baby
Oh, I could go on living
Without tasting your kiss
Get by without this moment
You touching me and holding me
Loving me like this but why?
Why would I want to, baby?
Oh, why?
