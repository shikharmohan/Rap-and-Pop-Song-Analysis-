Yeah the rumors are true
I deleted my Twitter, huh
Can you believe it 
I got 2, 2 million
The I said a-di-os
I had to say good-bye
And this little rap is to tell my fans why
Uh, uh
No, it wasnÃÂ¢€t because my friend told me to
YÃÂ¢€all know very well what you say I donÃÂ¢€t do
And the reasonÃÂ¢€s that simple
I started tweetin ÃÂ¢€Ãbout pimples
I stopped livin for moments
And started livin for people
Yeah, you write what youÃÂ¢€re doin
But who really cares
If IÃÂ¢€m playin with Noah
Or just doin my hair
Everything that I type
And everything that I do
All those lame gossip sites take it
And they make it news
I want my private life private
IÃÂ¢€m done tryin to please
I ainÃÂ¢€t livin for tabloids
No, IÃÂ¢€m livin for me
No more emo quotes 
And fake feuds with Demi
Yeah, IÃÂ¢€m done with all that
And the truth is IÃÂ¢€m too busy
Yeah I gotta admit
I miss Dane CookÃÂ¢€s tweets
And I really like lookin at Katy Perry and Britney
I might have some withdrawls
I was a little obsessed
But IÃÂ¢€m peacin out
And IÃÂ¢€m leavin with this
Uh, good-bye
Uh, uh good-bye
