I be bussin', parents be fussin' and cussin'
'Cause all I talk about is silicon and muffins
So if you didn't come to hear some strip club hits
Then get the hell on 'cause I'm getting' my mail on I'm hustlin'
I'm talkin' about foes and I'm talkin' about fans and kitties
I'm talkin' about ho's and I'm talking about Kansas City
That's where I dwell wit wit, my, my vills and I, I, I will
Pop hot rocks for real venomous
When it gets hot, the Tech's straight killin' hataz
When it gets rock, the sex rates 10, I made her sit on this jock
Spits quick game innovator chick generator
Quick trip James Lemonader
This is the beginning of blingin' and houses and women
Welcoming angels and demons on couches and sinnin'
I'm alive and well the demise will bring ghost stories
When I rise in hell them alive will still vote for me
Watch out 'cause here comes Tecca Nina

Bunzai baby, everone's high smokin' and drinkin'
And poppin' so hurry come fly 'cause I got plenty rolls
And I got plenty dough and we got plenty ho's
We roll on 24's
What it is? What it was? What it shall be?
Where the blizz? Where the ale? Where's the belve?
Caraboulou is 151 and Malibu Rum and pineapple so
What's this weakness you tryin' to sell me?
I represent the Rogue Dog Villain niggas
Better repent the foes all feelin' triggas
You got me bent, we rolls all peelin' skrilla
Roll call willin' killaz, froze yall feelin' millas
This be the best time to bust your best rhyme
You bring your best rhyme, I'm on your next line
And when I flex mine I see respect signs call the request line
And just say Tech N9NE
Watch out 'cause here comes Tecca Nina
Roll out 'cause here comes Tecca Nina
Drop down 'cause here comes Tecca Nina
Here comes Tecca Nina

Watch out 'cause here comes Tecca Nina
Roll out 'cause here comes Tecca Nina
Drop down 'cause here comes Tecca Nina

They call me Tecca nina, that be my nickname
I often wreck arenas, most of 'em chicks man
Spoil us with checks and Visa 'cause how we spit game
Havin' her bless the weiner, I love to get brain
For chicks in the back of the truck, backin' it up
Suckin' on tongues, laughin' it up
Gassin' at Kutt, bussin' her bun, slappin' it up
Quick wrappin' it up, get thrust with no funds then passin' the butt
Absolute when I shoot the shit
Juice the chicks with flows that you use to get
Take 'em to Adam's house, don't rat 'em out
Or take 'em down to Wess's get breasts
Up in your face and scat 'em out
Make room for the crew with beats that thump
I got the sickness horny chicks mighty mine be
Straight doom for the crew that skeet
Like chumps I bring 'em 66 triple 8 46993
Watch out 'cause here comes Tecca Nina
