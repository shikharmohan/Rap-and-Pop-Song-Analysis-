I thought that my first love would be my wife
But in junior high she moved away from here
And I thought Johnny'd always be my best friend
I haven't talked to him in fifteen years
Back when I had those fights with my old man
I never thought he'd be an old man
And I didn't know all those years ago
How the years would go flyin' by
Thought I knew it all but I was wrong
And I didn't know, I didn't know it at the time
I never thought good jobs were hard to find
Till I let my pride cost me one
I never thought my whole life would change
Till I heard the doctor say I had a son
I never really thought that I was lost
Until I heard my dyin' mother
Sing 'Old Rugged Cross'
And I didn't know all those years ago
How the years would go flyin' by
Thought I knew it all but I was wrong
And I didn't know, I didn't know it at the time
Oh, I thought I knew it all, oh but I was wrong
And I didn't know, I didn't know it at the time
I didn't know, didn't know, didn't know
I didn't know, oh, I didn't know, oh
