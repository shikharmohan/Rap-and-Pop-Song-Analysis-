Ladies and gentlemen
This is a Jazze Phizzle Productshizzle
'Missy', the princess is here 'Ciara'
(This beat is)
Automatic, supersonic, hypnotic, funky fresh
Work my body, so melodic, this beat rolls right through my chest
Everybody, ma and papi, came to party
Grab somebody,work ya body, work ya body
Let me see you one, two step
Rock it, don't stop it, everybody get on the floor
Crank the party up, we about to get it on
Let me see you one, two step
I love it when you one, two step
Everybody one, two step, we about to get it on
(This beat is)
Outrageous, so contagious, make you crave it
(Jazze made it)
So retarded, top charted, ever since the day I started
Strut my stuff and yes I flaunt it, goodies make the boys jump on it
No I can't control myself, now let me do my one, two step
Rock it, don't stop it, everybody get on the floor
Crank the party up, we about to get it on
Let me see you one, two step
I love it when you one, two step
Everybody one, two step, we about to get it on
We gone drop it like this
It don't matter to me, we can dance slow
Whichever way the beat drops our bodies will flow
So swing it over here Mr. DJ and we will, we will, rock you
It don't matter to me, we can dance slow
Whichever way the beat drops our bodies will flow
So swing it over here Mr. DJ and we will, we will, rock you
I shake it like JLO, make the boys say hello
'Cause they know I'm rockin' the beat
I know you heard about a lot of MCs
But they ain't got nothin' on me
Because I'm 5 foot 2, I wanna dance with you
And I'm sophistcated fun, I eat fillet minon
I'm nice and young, best believe I'm number one
Rock it, don't stop it, everybody get on the floor
Crank the party up, we about to get it on
Let me see you one, two step
I love it when you one, two step
Everybody one, two step, we about to get it on
Rock it, don't stop it, everybody get on the floor
Crank the party up, we about to get it on
Let me see you one, two step
I love it when you one, two step
Everybody one, two step, we about to get it on
This is for the hearing impaired
