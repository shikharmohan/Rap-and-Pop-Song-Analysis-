Someone found a letter you wrote me, on the radio
And they told the world just how you felt
It must have fallen out of a hole in your old
Brown overcoat
They never said your name
But I knew just who they meant.
Oh, I was so surprised and shocked, and I
Wondered too
If by change you heard it for yourself
I never told a soul just how I've been feeling
About you
But they said it really loud
They said it on the air
On the radio whoa oh oh
On the radio whoa oh oh
On the radio whoa oh oh
On the radio whoa oh oh now, now
Don't it kinda strike you sad when you hear our
Song
Things are not the same since we broke up last
June
The only thing that I wanna hear is that you love
Me still
And that you think you'll be comin' home real
Soon
Whoa oh yeah yeah
And it made me feel proud when I heard you say
You couldn't find the words to say it yourself
And now in my heart I know I can say what I
Really feel
'cause they said it really loud
They said it on the air
On the radio whoa oh oh
On the radio whoa oh oh
On the radio whoa oh oh
On the radio
If you think that love isn't found on the radio
Well tune right in you made find the love you
Lost
'cause now I'm sitting here with the man I sent
Away long ago
It sounded really loud they said it really loud
On the radio whoa oh oh
On the radio whoa oh oh
On the radio whoa oh oh
On the radio whoa oh oh
On the radio whoa oh oh
On the radio, radio, radio
