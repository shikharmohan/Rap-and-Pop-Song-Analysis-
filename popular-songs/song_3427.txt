People ask me what you doin' son
You're gonna drive yourself insane
You'll never find the sunshine
When you're followin' the rain
Seems like I'd take a new road
After all these years
But I wind up on
The same old trail of tears
I'm still walkin' down Memory Lane
'Cause I know I'll be runnin' into you
Reminiscin' through the pain
Recallin' things that we used to do
I'm lookin' up an old flame
Down on Heartbreak Avenue
I'm still walkin' down Memory Lane
'Cause I know I'll be runnin' into you
I hate the way I loved you
But my mind keeps goin' back
My train of thought just won't get off
That same old worn out track
It's an every night occasion
Me and your memory meet
On that endless lonely street
Of broken dreams
I'm still walkin' down Memory Lane
'Cause I know I'll be runnin' into you
Reminiscin' through the pain
Recallin' things that we used to do
I'm lookin' up an old flame
Down on Heartbreak Avenue
I'm still walkin' down Memory Lane
'Cause I know I'll be runnin' into you
I'm still walkin' down Memory Lane
'Cause I know I'll be runnin' into you
Reminiscin' through the pain
Recallin' things that we used to do
I'm lookin' up an old flame
Down on Heartbreak Avenue
And I'm still walkin' down Memory Lane
'Cause I know I'll be runnin' into you
Here she comes now
I'm still walkin'
(Walkin')
Down Memory Lane
I'm still walkin'
Down Memory Lane
I'm still walkin'
(Walkin')
Down Memory Lane
Lord, I'm walkin'
Down Memory Lane
Oh, I'm walkin'
(Walkin')
Down Memory Lane
I'm still walkin'
(Walkin', walkin')
Down Memory Lane
I'm still walkin'
