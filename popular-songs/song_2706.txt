Now and then I open up a trunk full of old souvenirs
Thumb through a scrapbook holding back the tears
I keep wishing we could do it once more
Just the way we did before
Take me back to Sycamore Park
Put the radio dial on the golden oldies
Hey, lay a blanket down and hold me
We can stay all night by the light of the moon above
So take me back, back to love
Ever since you took me to the big city looking for the start
Living in the fast lane is tearing us apart
Sometimes don't you want to trade it all in
For a little way back when
Take me back to Sycamore Park
Put the radio dial on the golden oldies
Hey, lay a blanket down and hold me
We can stay all night by the light of the moon above
So take me back, back to love
Well, I remember sneaking out the back, mama thought I was asleep
Watching for your headlights, creeping down the street
Trying to steal a kiss just anyway we can
Back where it all began
Take me back to Sycamore Park
Put the radio dial on the golden oldies
Lay a blanket down and hold me
We can stay all night by the light of the moon above
So take me back, back to love
Take me back to Sycamore Park
Put the radio dial on the golden oldies
And lay a blanket down and hold me
We can stay all night by the light of the moon above
So take me back, back to love
