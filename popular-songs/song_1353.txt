Well, I ain't had nothing to drink
I knew that's probably what you'd think
If I dropped by this time of night
Remember way back when
I promised you I'd drop in
At one of those meetings down at the Y
And they started talkin' 'bout steps you take
Mistakes you make, the hearts you break
And the price you pay, I almost walked away
And you could hear a pin drop when this old man
Stood up and said, "I'm gonna' say it again like I do every week
For those who don't know me"
It's the simple things in life like the kids at home and a loving wife
That you miss the most, when you lose control
And everything you love starts to disappear
The devil takes your hand and says, "No fear
Have another shot, just one more beer"
Yeah, I've been there, that's why I'm here
This ol' boy stood up in the aisle
Said he'd been living a life of denial
And he cried as he talked about wasted years
I couldn't believe what I heard
It was my life word for word
And all of the sudden it was clear
It's the simple things in life like the kids at home and a loving wife
That you miss the most, when you lose control
And everything you love starts to disappear
The devil takes your hand and says, "No fear
Have another shot, just one more beer"
Yeah, I've been there, that's why I'm here
I know for us it may be too late
But it would mean the world to me
If you were there when I stand to say
It's the simple things in life like the kids at home and a loving wife
That you miss the most, when you lose control
And everything you love starts to disappear
Devil takes your hand and says, "No fear
Have another shot, just one more beer"
Yeah, I've been there, that's why I'm here
Oh, I've been there, that's why I'm here
