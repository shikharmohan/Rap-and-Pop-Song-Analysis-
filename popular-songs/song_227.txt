I'm used to men approaching me
Tryna talk to me
Always tryna buy me things
Drinks to diamond rings
Fast cars, first class
To the Philippines
That's a daily thing
It don't interest me
Just then it came as a surprise
When I looked into your eyes
Never walked up to a guy
But here I go
I don't wanna waste your time
I just wanna make you mine
Wanna play with you all night
So tell me what your name is
And I know I'm acting strange
Girls ain't supposed to talk this way
But I can't let you slip away
So tell me what your name is
I see you sitting all alone
Tell me though, if you got a girl at home
I gotta know, is she taking care of you?
Like I would do
And he said I don't have a girl at home
But I'm feeling you
Just then it came as a surprise
When he looked into my eyes
Never walked up to a guy
But here I go
I don't wanna waste your time
I just wanna make you mine
Wanna play with you all night
So tell me what your name is
And I know I'm acting strange
Girls ain't supposed to talk this way
But I can't let you slip away
So tell me what your name is
Tell me what your name, what your name
Tell me what your name
Tell me what your name is
Tell me what your name, what your name
Tell me what your name
Tell me what your name is
I don't wanna waste your time
I just wanna make you mine
Wanna play with you all night
So tell me what your name is
And I know I'm acting strange
Girls ain't supposed to talk this way
But I can't let you slip away
So tell me what your name is
I don't wanna waste your time
I just wanna make you mine
Wanna play with you all night
So tell me what your name is
And I know I'm acting strange
Girls ain't supposed to talk this way
But I can't let you slip away
So tell me what your name is
