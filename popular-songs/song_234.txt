See me in the A
I drop it down low
I back this thing up
And make mo' money mo
And he up in my ear like
Go shawty go
No I ain't a stripper but I do it like a pro
Who said this girl can't make you bounce like this
Well shawty i'm the shit
Shawty i'm the shit
Lady in the street you know the rest
Put yo money on the flo'
How high can you go
See I got you watching
Everytime I drop it
Everytime I rock this woop
There she go
Make you wanna marry me
Make you wanna take me home
I'ma put it on you shawty
Woop here I go
