The cover of a magazine
Nothing but paper dream
Just another fantasy for sale
Telling me what I need
What should I do, who should I be
And that stuff don't matter to me at all
The sky is blue and the sun is shining
I feel like a bum with a pocket full of diamonds
I'm free as a bird and my spirit's flyin'
And that's enough to keep me smilin', smilin'
Guru man on my TV set
Selling the secrets to happiness
1-800-change your life today
Dreams, I've got my own
I ain't looking for a yellow brick road
I'm just gonna go my own way
The sky is blue and the sun is shining
I feel like a bum with a pocket full of diamonds
I'm free as a bird and my spirit's flyin'
And that's enough to keep me smilin'
Smilin', smilin'
Smilin', smilin'
The sky is blue and the sun is shining
I feel like a bum with a pocket full of diamonds
I'm free as a bird and my spirit's flyin'
And that's enough to keep me smilin'
I'm still smilin'
Gotta keep on smilin'
I'm still smilin'
