Dear Mrs. bill collector
I know you just doing your job
Don't mean to disrespect ya
But we been going through this thing since way back
I told you when I get the dough I would pay back
But I got problems baby
I got bigger problems baby
So why you talking about the money that I owed
Like as if I didn't know man it don't mean nothing to me
Cos right now I got my little boy crying and my grandmother dying
Could you please stop fucking with me
Listen here I ain't looking for no tears but my brother got a year
And my mother keep smoking that shit
On top of that i'm broke please put that in your notes
For the next one to call me up talking that shit
And then I holla
I just ain't into this shit anymore
I just might lose control
I feel like letting it go
Please just leave me
I need to be left
And if i'm wrong then let me be wrong
Just leave me alone
Dear Mr. policeman
Ay am I wrong or ain't you supposed to keep the peace man
I could have swore that I was driving pretty peaceful
So why the hell is you pulling over me for
Is it this black Mercedes
Oh no I get it I get it I get it
Or cos i'm black hmm maybe
Yeah hey tell me why my hands start sweating
And I hold my breath every time that you get behind me
I turn my music down so you won't hear a sound
Man i'm nervous like I got a couple pounds on me
You pulled me over you frowned on me
With your flashlight tell me what do you see
Thug niggas drug dealers it's a trip
Every nigga in this whip got a mother fucking college degree
I just ain't into this shit anymore
I just might lose control
I feel like letting it go
Please just leave me
I need to be left
And if i'm wrong then let me be wrong
Just leave me alone
