I've been trying to get on the lonely street
Got lost in the shadows, fell hard in the battle
Who cries when their suffering
I walk through the darkness, broken and heartless
I'm falling out, can you hear my voice?
I'm gonna find you through all the noise
Oh, you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do
So shine your light as I reach for you
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
It's the sound that I hear
Tells me not to give up
It breathes in my chest
And it runs through by blood
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love, woah, yeah
I've been told at least a 1000 times
Its not worth the struggle, the hurt or the trouble
I keep running up to these front guys
No, I won't surrender, I'll wait here forever
Standin' here with my back up high
Can't you see that it's worth the fight?
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
It's the sound that I hear
Tells me not to give up
It breathes in my chest
And it runs through by blood
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love, woah, yeah
I'm about to cross this battle field
I'm screamin' out, you hear me now
I'm holding on, stand on the ground
Screamin' now, can you hear me?
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
It's the sound that I hear
Tells me not to give up
It breathes in my chest
And it runs through by blood
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love, woah, yeah
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
It's the sound that I hear
Tells me not to give up
It breathes in my chest
And it runs through by blood
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love, woah, yeah
