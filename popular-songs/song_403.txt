I must look just like a fool
Here in the middle of the road
Standin' there in your rearview
And gettin' soaked to the bone
This land is flat as it is mean
A man can see for a hundred miles
So I'm still praying I might see
The glow of a brake light
But your wheels just turn down the road ahead
If it hurts at all you ain't showed it yet
I keep a lookin' for the slightest sign
That you might miss what you left behind
I know there's nothing stopping you now
But I'd settle for a slowdown
I held on longer then I should
Leaving you might change your mind
And those bright lights of Hollywood
Would fade in time
But your wheels just turn down the road ahead
If it hurts at all you ain't showed it yet
I keep a lookin' for the slightest sign
That you might miss what you left behind
I know there's nothing stopping you now
But I'd settle for a slowdown
But your wheels just turn down the road ahead
If it hurts at all you ain't showed it yet
You're just a tiny dot on that horizon line
Come on tap those brakes baby just one time
I know there's nothing stopping you now
I'm not asking you to turn back around
I'd settle for a slowdown
Come on just slow down
I'd settle for a slowdown
