(Now 'cause oh, oh)
I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door 'cause I won't come
I'm hidin' from the storm 'til the damage is
(Done)
(Oh, ah yeah, don't knock on my door, oh)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, tell me why
You gotta make me, make me
Make me, make me, make me cry, oh Lord
If I told you once, I told you a thousand times
You can't knock me off my feet
When I'm already on my knees
(Now 'cause oh, oh)
I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door 'cause I won't come
I'm hidin' from the storm 'til the damage is
(Done)
(Oh, ah yeah, don't knock on my door, oh)
Oh, yeah
Baby, baby, baby, baby tell me how
You think you're gonna live without my love now
I don't know why you gotta keep comin' around
Creepin' up my street
But boy, you can't bother me
(Now 'cause oh, oh)
I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door 'cause I won't come
I'm hidin' from the storm 'til the damage is
(Done)
(Oh, ah yeah, don't knock on my door, oh)
