Got a guitar, got a guitar on my back
And I'm standing on this lonesome railroad track
Train's a coming, it'll be here 'fore too long
But I don't think I can stop it with a song
Girl, that's the kind of the way I'm feeling
Trying to stop your leaving
Got a pebble, got a pebble in my hand
And I toss it out into the middle of the Rio Grande
But the river keeps running
Don't even know that I'm around
I could throw in a million more and not slow it down
Girl, that's kind of the way I'm feeling
Trying to stop your leaving
There's nothing I wouldn't try
If I thought it would change your mind
But you don't love me, no, you don't love me anymore
And I know as soon as you walk out that door
Train's a coming, river's running, train's a coming
River's running, pain's a coming, tears are running
And that's kind of the way I'm feeling
Knowing I couldn't stop your leaving
