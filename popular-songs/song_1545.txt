5AM at the Waffle House workers filing in 
Strippers walking out
Truckers driving down the interstate 
Doin' coffee and pills cause they got bills to pay
And over the Brooklyn bridge a lady runs 
Doing all she can to stay looking young Ã¢Â¦young
And underneath on a card board bed 
A man sleeping with shoes under his head
Welcome to America x2
College kids shot gun and beer 
A hobo prophet screaming end is near
A teenage girl in the bed of a truck 
Can't help but think that this just might be love
Welcome to America x2
Tears streaming down a mother's face 
When a folded flag comes home in her son's place
In a hospital room a new daddy cries 
When he holds his baby girl for the first time
She opens up her eyes
Welcome to America x3
The houses lined up like dominos 
High rises high as they can go
A Single Mom at the laundromat 
Dropping every last quarter that she has 
Grandmas making apple pies
Grandpas at the barber shop telling lies
Welcome to America X5
