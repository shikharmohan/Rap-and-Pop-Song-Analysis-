I can see it in your eyes and feel it in your touch
I know that you're scared but you've never been this loved
It's a long shot, baby, I know it's true,
But if anyone can make it, I'm betting on me and you
Just keep on moving into me
I know you're going to see
The best is yet to come
Don't fear it now; we're going all the way
Where that sun is shining on a brand new day
It's a long way down, and it's a leap of faith
But I'm never giving up, 'cause I know we got a once in a lifetime love
Everybody's looking for what we've found
Some wait their whole lives and it never comes around
So don't hold back now, 
Just let go of all you've ever known
You can put your hand in mine
Don't fear it now; we're going all the way
Where that sun is shining on a brand new day
It's a long way down, and it's a leap of faith
But I'm never giving up, 'cause I know we got a once in a lifetime love
I close my eyes and I see you standing right there
Saying "I do" and they're throwing rice in our hair
Then the first one's born, then a brother comes along and he's got your smile
I'll be looking back on the life we had still by your side
So don't fear it now; we're going all the way
Where that sun is shining on a brand new day
It's a long way down, and it's a leap of faith
But I'm never giving up, 'cause I know we got a once in a lifetime love
