Runnin' from the rate race just as fast as I can
Take off my tie so I can breathe
Me, I'm going where the fresh air's blowin'
Take a little walk in the country with me
Walk in the country with me
You watch the sun sinkin' down on the trees
It's gonna do us some good to get down in the woods
Take a little walk in the country with me, hey
I'm so sick of all them TV shows
I need some dirt road under my feet
C'mon let's point our toes where the red fern grows
Take a little walk in the country with me, come on now
Walk in the country with me
You watch the sun sinkin' down on the trees
It's gonna do us some good to get down in the woods
Take a little walk in the country with me
Walkin' in the country
Oh, oh, oh, bless my soul
Just gimme that country road, yeah
Come on now
Walk in the country with me
You watch the sun sinkin' down on the trees
It's gonna do us some good to get down in the woods
Take a little walk in the country with me
Take a little walk in the country with me
Come on now baby
Take a little walk in the country with me
Yeah, yeah
