verse 1 :
candlelight's and mood music ooohh
champagne, sweeter when i put you to it mmm
i take her by her hand and hold her tight
but she don't want romance
it's friday night
chorus :
she wants the stroke lights, bright flashing, high life, high fashion, v.i.p section, celebrities, flexing dance floor, full crowded, music, up loud and bumpin', whole place is jumpin' [while ?] wait it's something. it's what she wants, it's what she loves. up in the club. until the sun comes up.
verse 2 :
all i want is us
to spend one night
outside of this club
but she just can't
the night life calls her name
and she must go
the pleasure is my pain
chours :
she wants the stroke lights, bright flashing, high life, high fashion, v.i.p section, celebrities, flexing dance floor, full crowded, music, up loud and bumpin', whole place is jumpin' [while ?] wait it's something. it's what she wants, it's what she loves. up in the club. until the sun comes up.
bridge :
ooo she wants the night time 
all that i have is love and that just won't do [just won't do, no]
she wants the night time living the spotlight dying my dreams of you [dying my dreams of you] (x2)
ooo said i wish it could be just us two
my love just won't do
chorus :
she wants the stroke lights, bright flashing, high life, high fashion, v.i.p section, celebrities, flexing dance floor, full crowded, music, up loud and bumpin', whole place is jumpin' [while ?] wait it's something. it's what she wants, it's what she loves. up in the club. until the sun comes up. (x2)
