I can pretend that I don't see you
I can pretend I don't wanna hold you
When you're around, when you're around
I can say that nothing was right
But we know if I looked in your eyes
I'd break down, yeah, let's break down
If I could for just one night
To be with you, to make it right
And what we were and what we are
Is hidden in the scars
If I could, take you there
I won't let go, this I swear
You won't have to wonder what we are
'Cause you won't have to ever look too far
It's in the scars, it's hidden in the scars
If I told you that I love you
But I'm doing alright without you
It'd be a lie but I could try
I'd run a thousand miles we're leaving
You're the only one, I want you breathing
To break down, yeah, let's break down
If I could, for just one night
To be with you, to make it right
And what we were and what we are
Is hidden in the scars
If I could, take you there
I won't let go, this I swear
You won't have to wonder what we are
'Cause you won't have to ever look too far
It's in the scars
Yeah, I'll tell you all my secrets
All the ones I've kept inside
And I'll give you all the reasons
That you faded from my life
I will learn to go
Baby, come here for
I will let you up away
If I could for just one night
To be with you, to make it right
And what we were and what we are
Is hidden in the scars
If I could, take you there
I won't let go, baby this I swear
You won't have to wonder what we are
'Cause you won't have to ever look too far
It's in the scars, it's hidden in the scars
It's hidden in the scars
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I can pretend that I don't see you
And I can pretend I don't wanna hold you
When you're around
