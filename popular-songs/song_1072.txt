Yo, this sound like some movie shit right?
Get ya popcorn, get ya condiments, you dont wanna miss nothin, ok listen
[Verse 1]
They call me +Edward Scissorhands+ 'cause i'm tryin to cut
She claim she got cramps, im gone get you to suck
And you not gon use ya teeth ya hear?
You gon find out +What Lies Beneath+ right here
+The Preachers Wife+ dont give head? Get a divorce man
The kids been callin you the headless horseman
Like +Sleepy Hollow+ see she swallow
Suck like ol girl got booed at +Apollo
+13 Ghost+ use my +Hollow Mans+ for +Friday 13th+
You be +Ghost+, +Backdraft+ from the toast
Niggaz who drop names is, oh so shameless
Get a chain thats stainless, they +Almost Famous+
My bling got em callin me, +Lord Of The Rings+
+The Shining+ make it hard for her to +Do The Right Thing+
But I +Dont say word+, I'll never tell
Until you get a Kanye beat, you'll never sell
[Chorus]
I'm livin a movie, not livin by rules
It's just a movie, dont lose ya cool
1,2 Ye comin for you, 3,4 better lock your door
5,6, 7,8, 9,10 never sleep again
[Verse 2]
Shits deeper, than +The Sleepers+ 
+Jeeper Creep-up+ on your block and cops +Clock-us+
Try to +Baller Block-us+, use +Absolute Power+
You gave him +9 1/2 Weeks+, why you tryin to +Rush Hours+ huh?
And in +The Cell+ dont drop soap in the showers huh
They try to give me +Life+, I'm out in a hour huh
Back on the block wit more +Juice+ than Pac
Makin +Mo' Money+ 'cause of +The, The, The, The Roc+
[Chorus]
I said some shit like, umm, you in my things like +Suicide Kings+
There's only +Three Kings+, +Me, Myself and Irene+, you know what im sayin
