Head back, eyes close, deep breath, let it go
Bare with me, I'll take good care
I'm an expert, other girls just can't compare
I'm highly recommended, don't need a second opinion
You'll be all better, baby, once I'm finished
So be a good patient, be patient
Stay under my observation
And holla back in the morning
I know you never had a girl quite like me
Uh me, uh me, uh me
I take a hot boy, oy and give him cold feet
Uh feet, uh feet
When it comes to love, I'm like a surgeon, I'ma true tactician
I'ma make your body better when we get in the right position
I'm like a surgeon, I'ma make your body jump
Every time my body pumps, uh huh, uh huh
I'm like a surgeon until your reflexes leave your knees
My love's like anesthesia, I'll rock you fast to sleep
I'm like a surgeon, oh yes, I'm fully qualified
Lay your head back on that pillow and relax your mind
Check, check, calling patient, patient, patient number one
Make sure that you sign out, sign out, out when you're done
Make sure you grab a sucker on the way and out the door
And make your next appointment and come back and get some more
Now that you learned, you'll be so glad you returned
Open up your mouth, let me check you out
My ears will be your stethoscope, we'll fill your vital signs
Make sure your heart beats like mine
I appreciate your recovery time
But you need a physical one more time
Head to feet, baby you're just fine
You're my best patient and you never have to wait in line, no
I know you never had a girl quite like C
Uh C, uh me, uh me, uh me
I take a hot boy, oy and give him cold feet
Uh feet, uh feet
When it comes to love, I'm like a surgeon, I'ma true tactician
I'ma make your body better when we get in the right position
I'm like a surgeon, I'ma make your body jump
Every time my body pumps, uh huh, uh huh
I'm like a surgeon until your reflexes leave your knees
My love's like anesthesia, I'll rock you fast to sleep
I'm like a surgeon, oh yes, I'm fully qualified
Lay your head back on that pillow and relax your mind
Check, check, calling patient, patient, patient number one
Make sure that you sign out, sign out, out when you're done
Make sure you grab a sucker on the way and out the door
And make your next appointment and come back and get some more
That's it baby, you can count on C
Give you everything you need
Girl, that you got ain't got nothing on me
So call me in case of an emergency
