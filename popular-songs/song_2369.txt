[Verse One:]
I'm in my ride at the corner by the light
Bout to pull up in front of your door
So make sure that your body's lookin' right
Let me know what I came out here for
You could be wifey material
Baby I'm not mad at you
Girl you get me high
See, I've been jonesin'
Got a crush on you
Not tryin to put a rush on you
We can let it ride
[Chorus:] 
We can take it slow, slow (Take it slow babe)
Anything you want
Whatever's on your mind tonight (Whatever's on your mind tonight)
Baby girl come on, come on
Where you wanna go (oh yeah)
We can take a ride tonight (We can take a ride, anywhere)
Anything you want, one
Let me put you on (Let me put you on)
Gotta make you mine tonight (And make you mine)
We can take it slow, slow (Take it slow babe)
Or anything you want
Whatever's on your mind tonight
[Verse 2:]
(Listen)
So think about it yeah
If you like how I move
Tell me what I should do
To get you in the mood
And how you like it baby?
From the front (oOh)
To the back (oOh)
Can't argue with that (Yeah)
Girl, anything
Oh I
Want you to bring it to me tonight babe
I dont think you heard me
I, I want you to bring it to me tonight babe
Girl we can...
[Chorus:] 
We can take it slow, slow (Take it slow babe)

Anything you want, one

Gotta make you mine tonight (And make you mine)
We can take it slow, slow (Take it slow babe)
Or anything you want
Whatever's on your mind tonight
[Bridge:]
Tell me
I want to work that body
Till you wanna stop me (Till you tell me to stop baby)
All night
And I gaurantee that you'll be satisfied (Satisfied)
Let me do freaky things to you (Freaky things to your body)
Just don't be scared of me babe (No, no)
You can have anything you want (You can have it all)
'cause it's your world (Take it slow baby)
[Chorus:] 
We can take it slow, slow (Take it slow babe)
