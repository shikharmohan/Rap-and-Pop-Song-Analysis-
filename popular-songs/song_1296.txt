Always Crossing Fingers
Holding Back
Drawing Circles On The Floor
Pretending You Don't See Me
Blinding Your Self Completly
Running From The Hands That Hold You High
Hold On This Time
I Will Take You 
To Where You Belong
Hold On This Time
You Don't Have To 
Bleed For Me
You Don't Have To 
Bleed For Me
