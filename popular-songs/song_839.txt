Ohhh Ohh
It's JB
My friends say im a fool to think that you're the one for me
I guess im just a sucker for love
Cause honestly the truth is that you know im never leaving
Cause you're my angel sent from above
Baby you can do no wrong
My money is yours, give you a little more because I love ya, love ya
With me girl, is where you belong, Just stay right here
I promise my dear, put nothing above ya, bove ya
Love me love me say that you love me
Fool me fool me, oh how you do me
Kiss me kiss me say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me love me say that you love me
Fool me fool me, oh how you do me
Kiss me kiss me say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me
People try to tell me, but I still refuse to listen,
Cause they don't get to spend time with you
A minute with you is worth more them a thousand days without your love,
Oh your love, ohh.
Baby you can do no wrong
My money is yours, give you a little more because I love ya, love ya
With me girl, is where you belong, Just stay right here
I promise my dear, put nothing above ya.
Love me love me say that you love me
Fool me fool me, oh how you do me
Kiss me kiss me say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me love me say that you love me
Fool me fool me, oh how you do me
Kiss me kiss me say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me
My heart is blind, but I don't care,
Because when im with you, everything just disappears
And every time, I hold you near, I never wanna let you go. Ohh ohh
Love me love me say that you love me
Fool me fool me, oh how you do me
Kiss me kiss me say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me love me say that you love me
Fool me fool me, oh how you do me
Kiss me kiss me say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me
