I like an old guitar
Playin' a Gosdin song
In a smoky bar
That's what turns me on, yeah
If that makes me a little old school
Go ahead and call me yesterday's old fool
If that makes me a little throwback
Throw it at me, don't worry, I can take that
Call me hick, hillbilly, hell I'm proud to be what that makes me
I like a 60's truck
The kind that's solid steel
The kind that always runs
It takes a man to turn that wheel
If that makes me a little old school
Go ahead and call me yesterday's old fool
If that makes me a little throwback
Throw it at me, don't worry, I can take that
Call me hick, hillbilly, hell I'm proud to be what that makes me
Yeah, I don't swear in front of no woman
I answer yes sir to my old man
I drink my liquor with a side of nothin'
Yeah, good and country that's what I am
If that makes me a little old school
Go ahead and call me yesterday's old fool
If that makes me a little throwback
Throw it at me, don't worry, I can take that
Call me hick, hillbilly, hell I'm proud to be what that makes me
What that makes me
