[J. Cole - Verse 2]
Momma said I should reconsider law school
that means I wear a suit and be a troop and feel awful
hell naw, got a degree but what that cost you
you make a good salary just to pay Sally May
thats real as ever
ducking bill collectors like Jehova's witness
when they showed up at your door at Christmas
was broke as dishes tryna let it go
hit the club she drop it low
lower than my credit score
account overdraft what I got this debit for
summers dead it got me drinking thinking b-tch I better blow
I better blow
these hoes aint checking for no n-gga with no vehicle
you border like Mexico
hey baby girl what it look like
and where ya head at
and what ya cook like
she said where ya bread at
and what your whip like
you aint got one or the other than brother good night
b-tch I'm about to blow up
look I'm about to blow up
yeah got to the club early just to get a friend
wait for hoes to show up
but now its bottles at the tables bring the models boy
I'm about to po' up
uh ha, you know what
b-tch I'm about to blow up
left side left side hey
right side right side ah ha
left side left side hey
[Chorus]
Praise God it's hard to stay spiritual
how they got these n-ggas on the TV selling miracles
you mean to tell me everything gon be fine
if I call your hotline and pay 29.99 sh-t
well damn, why aint you say so
take this shaking ass multiply all my pesos
and erase my number out the phone of these fake hoes
I saved her number just in case but now it's case closed
to you n-ggas biting my flows and my subject matter
you'll never be me partner so it don't f-cking matter
you try to be and your career will see funerals
and be you thats what it sounds, beautiful
then maybe you could blow up
and maybe you could blow up
sh-t but you know what
for now b-tch I'm about to blow up
