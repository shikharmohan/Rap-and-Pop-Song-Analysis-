Oh, I've been standin' underneath
A dark old cloud now
Waitin' for the sun to shine
Waitin' for the sun to shine
On my heart again
Oh, I've been standin' underneath
A dark old cloud now
Waitin' for the sun to shine
Waitin' for the sun to shine
On my heart again
Oh, I've been throwin'
A lot of good love away now
Waitin' for the sun to shine
Waitin' for the sun to shine
On my heart again
Oh, I've been throwin'
A lot of good love away now
Waitin' for the sun to shine
Waitin' for the sun to shine
On my heart again
Waitin' for the sun to shine
Waitin' for the sun to shine
On my heart again
Waitin' for the sun to shine
Waitin' for the sun to shine
On my heart again
Oh, I've been standin' underneath
A dark old cloud now
Waitin' for the sun to shine
Waitin' for the sun to shine
On my heart again
Oh, I've been standin' underneath
A dark old cloud now
Waitin' for the sun to shine
Waitin' for the sun to shine
On my heart again
Oh, I've been standin' underneath
A dark old cloud
