I can't live with you, but I can't live with out ya
Not breathin' with you, it hard to breathe without ya
Think to myself everyday, how they slit us apart?
Four different men that shared the same heart
It had to happen this way, us go our separate way
Would be lyin' if I said, I didn't Miss Col Fax Days
Sit and think to myself how this thing has changed my life
Damn, we was suppose to be boys for life
This is my growin' pains 'cause by the fortune and fame
Thought we'd be together forever and ever and ever
Never thought we'd go our separate ways
Now, look how things have changed
Looks like there never, ever be the same
So hard to explain what went wrong
After we were together for too long
Now, never be the same again
Tell me how this thing happened?
Damn, this is my growin' pain
Some people don't know that I tried it again
Even though I was sour, I tried to be a man
I couldn't hold a grudge, knowin' in my heart I still had love
But If ya'll knew what went down you'd be like,"What the fuck?"
They say, you don't know what you got until it's gone
Loyalty, honesty, where did we go wrong?
I guess it was Gods grace for me to be alone
This is my growin' pains 'cause by the fortune and fame
Thought we'd be together forever and ever and ever
Never thought we'd go our separate ways
Now, look how things have changed
Looks like there never, ever be the same
So hard to explain what went wrong
After we were together for too long
Now, never be the same again
Tell me how this thing happened?
Damn, this is my growin' pain
How could this ever be, them no longer apart of me?
What did you do to turn them other boys against me?
I just have one thing to say
What you do comes back your way
So many things were said
So many false statements about me against my manager Chris
Sometimes I just feel like givin' up
Like I was nothin', like I couldn't go on with out them
But now, I feel like God is lookin' down on me
And he should carry my soul as I take this solo journey
I never meant for any of this to happen
I'm sorry, but I have no regrets
This is my growin' pains 'cause by the fortune and fame
Thought we'd be together forever and ever and ever
Never thought we'd go our separate ways
Now, look how things have changed
Looks like there never, ever be the same
So hard to explain what went wrong
After we were together for too long
Now, never be the same again
Tell me how this thing happened?
Damn, this is my growin' pain
Damn, damn, this is my growin' pain
