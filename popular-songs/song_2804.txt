I met an old man yesterday next to me on a west bound plane
He said, "I was married 60 years. I swear it feels like she's still here."
Then he took out her picture
Starting at that black and white, the tears filled up in his eyes
I said you were a lucky man, he said I feel like I still am
When he told me her name, I heard myself say
Chorus
I wanna be somebody's Chelsea
Someboy's worl
Somebody's day and night, one and only girl
A part of a love story that never has an end
You know that's what every woman wants to be
Somebody's Chelsea
He made me laugh when he talked about their first date and her father's doubts
He said "Even as her hair turned gray, she still took my breath away and that never changed with time."
That's when I closed my eyes
Repeat Chorus
And when we finally said goodbye I hugged him and said
"I'll never forget how you showed me what it means
To be somebody's Chelsea
Somebody's world
Somebody's day and night, one and only girl
A part of a love story that never has an end
You know that's what every woman wants to be
And I want to be
Somebody's Chelsea
Somebody's Chelsea
Somebody's Chelsea
Somebody's Chelsea
