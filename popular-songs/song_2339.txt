Lookin' back on it all I
Wish you would've said somethin'
Before we got this far, I
And I wouldn't be caught up in
Another situation that really got me breakin'
And I don't know what I'm gonna do
I know, I know you see me
See me on Music TV, you're makin' money
Makin' money doin' your thing but I don't
I don't wanna up and leave
And try to be what who the media says
I don't want somethin' that's made for TV
Rather fall in love with a girl that's made for me
Know everybody thinks that it might sound crazy
But I, I love my baby, I can't leave her, no
I don't want somethin' that's made for TV
Rather fall in love with a girl that's made for me
Know that everybody thinks that it might sound crazy
But I, I love my baby
I don't want something that's made
I know you think I'm lyin' every time that I say
I don't wanna see you cryin' all because of me, oh
The thought of me and you is ill
But with her, it's somethin' real
And I can't let that go, oh, no
I know you see me
See me on Music TV, you're makin' money
Makin' money doin' your thing
But I don't wanna up and leave
'Coz of somethin' that the media says
I don't want somethin' that's made for TV
Rather fall in love with a girl that's made for me
Know everybody thinks that it might sound crazy
But I, I love my baby, I can't leave her, no
I don't want somethin' that's made for TV
Rather fall in love with a girl that's made for me
Know that everybody thinks that it might sound crazy
But I, I love my baby
I don't want something that's made
Made for TV, made for me
Might sound crazy but I, I love my baby
Made for TV, made for me
Might sound crazy but I, I love my baby
I don't want somethin' that's made
I don't want somethin' that's made for TV
Rather fall in love with a girl that's made for me
Know everybody thinks that it might sound crazy
But I, I love my baby, I can't leave her, no
I don't want somethin' that's made for TV
Rather fall in love with a girl that's made for me
Know that everybody thinks that it might sound crazy
But I, I love my baby
I don't want something that's made
That's made for TV
Rather fall in love with a girl that's made for me
Know everybody thinks that it might sound crazy
But I, I love my baby, I can't leave her, no
I don't want somethin' that's made for TV
Rather fall in love with a girl that's made for me
Know that everybody thinks that it might sound crazy
But I, I love my baby
I don't want something that's made
Made for TV
