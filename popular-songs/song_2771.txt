He was always Santa Claus to them
Every year, he'd magically appear here in our den
They would laugh and tease and say you look a lot like dad
He'd just smile and ask, "Have you been good or bad?"
Oh, but life ain't always like a holiday
Some things change and sometimes people go their separate ways
He just called and said, he'd like to be here for the kids
Wish them Merry Christmas when they open up their gifts
And even though it might be hard on me
How could I let them down?
So Santa Claus is coming back to town
Here it is Christmas Eve, the kids are sleepin'
Lights flashing in the trees, oh, I keep thinkin'
Tomorrow I'll see him, tomorrow I'll see him
I guess, I ought to try to go to bed
I can't rehearse tomorrow any longer in my head
He'll walk in so nonchalant as if he'd never gone
And they'll be glad to see him, I'll be barely hangin' on
And just like that he'll go
And turn my whole world upside down
'Cause Santa Claus is coming back to town
No it's never really easy
When this time of year rolls around
'Cause Santa Claus is coming back to town, ohh
