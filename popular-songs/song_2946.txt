I think it was me, it must have been me
I guess I did something wrong
I tried too hard, wanted too much
I guess that's why he's gone
I lost my pride and I falled and cried
I felt like a little kid
What's wrong with me?
I still can't believe I did the things I did
I couldn't change him
He was gonna break my heart
I saw it coming
Yeah, I knew it from the start
When you love
  (When you love)
When you love someone like that
When you give what you can't take back
When you love
  (When you love)
With all your heart and soul
It's so hard to let it go
When you love someone like that, yeah
When you love someone like that
Girl, it ain't right, it just ain't right
Don't tell yourself that it was you
You followed your heart, you gave it your best
There's nothing more you can do
Guys like him are like the wind
And you know it's just too bad
They blow in and out again
And never know what they had
Girl, I can tell you
He'll do the same to someone else
It ain't about you
So don't be so hard on yourself
'Cause when you love
  (When you love)
When you love someone like that
When you give what you can't take back
When you love
  (When you love)
With all your heart and soul
It's so hard to let it go
When you love someone like that
  (When you love someone like that)
Oh, when you love someone like that
Oh, we've all loved and lost
It's happened to us all
I hear what you're saying
But I feel like the only one
Now you might feel right but you're not
You're alright
(I'm alright)
You're okay
(I'm okay)
You're gonna make it anyway
When you love someone like that
  (When you love someone like that)
When you love
  (When you love)
With all your heart and soul
It's so hard to let it go
When you love
  (When you love)
When you love someone like that

When you give what you can't take back
When you love
  (When you love)
With all your heart and soul
