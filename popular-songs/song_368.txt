(Mike Ward / Dierks Bentley)
Like the leaves I get restless
I just can't seem to settle down
When the autumn wind blows, it cuts right to my soul
And pulls my roots out of the ground
Chorus
Lonesome why do you love me you won't leave me
Why can't we ever be apart
Just when love finds me your chains they bind me
Forever shackled to your heart
Lonesome why do you love me
Rain ain't fallin on my windshield
But there's tears in my rearview
Nature's dyin I know behind she's cryin
Why do we leave them sad and blue
Chorus
You won't leave me
Chorus
Why do you love me
You won't let me be won't set me free
Lonesome why do you love me
