Wake up everybody
No more sleepin' in bed
No more backward thinkin'
Time for thinkin' ahead
The world has changed
So very much
From what it used to be
There is so much hatred
War and poverty, whoa, oh
Wake up, all the teachers
Time to teach a new way
Maybe then they'll listen
To what'cha have to say
'Cause they're the ones who's coming up
And the world is in their hands
When you teach the children
Teach 'em the very best you can
The world won't get no better
If we just let it be, na, na, na
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it, yeah
Just you and me
Wake up, all the doctors
Make the old people well
They're the ones who suffer
And who catch all the hell
But they don't have so very long
Before the Judgment Day
So wont'cha make them happy
Before they pass away
Wake up, all the builders
Time to build a new land
I know we can do it
If we all lend a hand
The only thing we have to do
Is put it in our mind
Surely things will work out
They do it every time
The world won't get no better
If we just let it be, na, na, na
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it, yeah
Just you and me
It's the god hour
The morning I wake up
Just for the breath of life I thank my maker
My mom say I come from hustlers and shakers
My mom built it on skyscrapers and acres
He said take us back to where we belong
I try to write a song
As sweet as these arms the one the type to bare arms
And wear my heart on my sleeve
Even when I fell in God I believe
Read the days that weave through the maze
The seasons so amazing
Feed them and raised them
Seasons are aging
Earthquakes, wars, and rumors
I want us to get by but
We're more than consumers
We more than shooters, more than looters
Created in this image so God live through us
And even in this generation, living through computers
Only love love love can reboot u
Wake up, everybody
Wake up, everybody
Need a little help, y'all
Yes I do, need a little help
Need a little help, y'all ay
Wake up everybody
Wake up everybody
Wake up everybody
