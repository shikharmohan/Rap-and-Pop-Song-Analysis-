For you I'd write a symphony
I'd tell the violin it's time to sink or swim
Watch me play for ya
For you I'd be running a thousand miles
Just get to where you are
Step to the beat of my heart
I don't need a whole lot
But for you I need, I'd rather give you the world
Or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one
Giving you all this attention
Baby, listen
I just need somebody to love
I, I don't need too much
Just somebody to love
Somebody to love
I don't need nothing else, I promise, girl, I swear
I just need somebody to love
I need somebody
I, I need somebody
I need somebody
I, I need somebody to love
Everyday I'd bring sun around
I'll sweep away the clouds
Smile for me
I would take every second, every single time
Spend it like my last dime
Step to the beat of my heart
I don't need a whole lot
But for you I need, I'd rather give you the world
Or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one
Giving you all this attention
Baby, listen
I just need somebody to love
I, I don't need too much
Just somebody to love
Somebody to love
I don't need nothing else, I promise, girl, I swear
I just need somebody to love
I need somebody
I, I need somebody
I need somebody
I, I need somebody to love
I need somebody
I, I need somebody
I need somebody
I, I need somebody to love
And you can let it out
Anything you want
I can bring, give you the finer things, yeah
But what I really want, I can't find 'cause
Money can't find me somebody to love, oh
Find me somebody to love, oh
I need somebody to love, yeah
I, I don't need too much
Just somebody to love
Somebody to love
I don't need nothing else, I promise, girl, I swear
I just need somebody to love
I need somebody
I, I need somebody
I need somebody
I, I need somebody
I need somebody
I, I need somebody
I need somebody
I, I need somebody
I need somebody
I need somebody

Is she out there? Is she out there?
Is she out there? Is she out there?
I just need somebody to love
