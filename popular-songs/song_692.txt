Right here, it's another Dark Child Classic, you know
Somethin' that you can lean to
Somethin' that you can ride to
Somethin' that you can step to, you know
Keep back
Sometimes real love can be
Not seen 'cause you're thinkin'
What's right in front of you
Can't be the one for you
Then one day you realize that
There are feelings that you can't hold back
And you're so caught up now that's all you think of
Crazy how
All that talk of us not able to last, oh
Just because of mistakes we made in the past
But they failed to understand
I got you and nobody can come and change a thing
'Cause you gotta know, you got me
And it feels so good to have you back now
I'm so proud, I got you
And if somebody tries to take you from me
They will see, I got you, you got me
I got you
Things are often said to
Doubt what I feel for you
But words that people say
Won't take my love away
Although it hurts sometimes, it's alright
But why they say some things? That ain't right
I never know but please understand that
Baby, it ain't nothin'
All that talk of us not able to last
Just because of mistakes we made in the past
But they failed to understand
I got you and nobody can come and change a thing
(Oh no)
'Cause you gotta know, you got me
(You got me)
And it feels so good to have you back now
I'm so proud
(I'm so proud)
I got you and if somebody tries to take you from me
(They'll see)
They will see, I got you
(I got you, baby)
You got me
(You got me, baby)
I got you
(I got you, baby)
You got me
(You got me, baby)
Talk, is all that people can do
Never mind all that love, all that you
Gotta do is simply
Love, trust, and just stay focused on us
Together, we'll get through
Whatever if we don't let speculations
Mix situations up, we'll be alright
I got you and nobody can come and change a thing
(Nobody, nobody)
'Cause you gotta know, you got me
And it feels so good to have you back now
I'm so proud
I got you and if somebody tries to take you from me
(Oh, oh)
They will see, I got you
(I got you, baby)
You got me
(You got me, baby)
I got you
(Ooh)
And nobody can come and change a thing
(Feels so good inside)
'Cause you gotta know, you got me
(You got me, baby)
And it feels so good to have your back now
I'm so proud
I got you and if somebody tries to take you from me
(Oh baby, they'll see)
They will see, I've got you
(I got you)
You got me
(Yes, you got me, baby)
I got you
(Nothing comes between us)
You got me
(You got me)
I got you
(Through whatever)
You got me
(You're all that I need)
I got you
(Oh, baby)
You got me
(Forever, baby)
I got you
(I got you)
You got me
(You got me)
I got you, you got me
I got you, you got
