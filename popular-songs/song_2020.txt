What I wouldnÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢t give to wrestle over the remote control
What I wouldnÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢t give to hit you harder than you thought I could with the pillow
And we stop just for a second because you got a feather in your eye (eye)
I get it out and you kiss me I smile and then we get back to our pillow fight
Now that sounds like fun
If the sky begins to fall we wouldnÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢t even notice
Really wouldnÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢t bother us at all if the world came to an end
Nothing matters but us two, when IÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢m laying around with you
When IÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢m laying around with you
What I wouldnÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢t give to
Oh what I wouldnÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢t give to cook you dinner from the microwave
And what I wouldnÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢t give to burn the popcorn and hear you tell me, ÃÂ¢€Ã"baby thatÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢s okayÃÂ¢€Ã
Baby thatÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢s okay
Then you leave to go to the store and its almost too much for me
Though I know itÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢ll only be a minute
Then you come back through the door with a bag of all the foods that weÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢re not supposed to eat
Now tonight that canÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢t be beat
If the sky begins to fall we wouldnÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢t even notice
Really wouldnÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢t bother us at all if the world came to an end
Nothing matters but us two, when IÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢m laying around with you
When IÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢m laying around with you
What I wouldnÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢t give to
I want to be in your arms where no harm could ever come my way
I want to be where you are oh near or far every night and day oh
If the sky begins to fall we wouldnÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢t even notice (said I wouldnÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢t notice)
Really wouldnÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢t bother us at all if the world came to an end (wouldnÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢t bother us)
Nothing matters but us two, when IÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢m laying around with you
When IÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢m laying around with you
When IÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢m laying around with you
When IÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢m laying around with you
If the sky begins to fall we wouldnÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢t even notice (wouldnÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢t notice)
Really wouldnÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢t bother us at all if the world came to an end (world came to an end)
Nothing matters but us two, when IÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢m laying around with you
Laying around with you
When IÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢m laying around with you
Laying around with you
Laying around with you
What I wouldnÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢t give to
When IÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢m laying around with you
No, no, no when IÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢m laying around with you
