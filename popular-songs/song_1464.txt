Friday night butterflies
Like clockwork they'd arrive
A little chill and the october sky
Nervous till the kickoff game
4 quarters win or lose
Spent saturdays black and blue
But it was what I love to do
And it was more than just a game
It was my life and it was fun
Another season of my life is done
Another race i'm glad I got to run
Another chapter in my life its over
No i'm never gonna feel like that again
Times rushin by me like the wind
Never be as young as I was then
No i'm never gonna feel like that again
Practice dancin in my garage
Two left feet and a white corsage
Daddy let me borrow the dodge
Said dont bring her home on empty
Swung by and picked up Cindy Lou
Took her to the prom for a dance or two
Then we drove to the water blue and thats where she kissed me
It was my life and it was fun
Another season of my life is done
Another race i'm glad I got to run 
Another chapter of my life its over
No i'm never gonna feel like that again
Times rushin by me like the wind
Never be as young as I was then
no i'm never gonna feel like that again
I got a call one july day
Cindy Lou was in that way
Had a big decision to make
and I couldn't take it lightly
At first I thought of leavin town
but i couldn't let our families down
now i'm out here throwin this ball around
with a boy that looks just likes me
Its my life and its sure fun
Another season of my lifes begun
Another race i'm glad I get to run
another chapter of my life i'm writin
No i'm never gonna feel like this again
Times rushin by me like the wind
Got to grab each moment that I can
Cuz i'm never gonna feel like this again
no i'm never gonna feel like this again
Nooooooooo I'm never gonna feel like this again
