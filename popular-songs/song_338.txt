Life is seen more clearly through our tears
'Cause we all find some faith when we face our fears
When my life's goin' like I want God becomes an after thought
And I start trying to build my heaven here
A better believer would look to the skies
Shout hallelujah with tears in his eyes
Open his heart and start givin' it all away
When I take a hard look at myself
And count my blessings I can't but help
But wonder if there's been some kind of mistake
This life of mine should belong to a better believer
All we really need in life is love
And in my time I've had more than enough
But some days I'm not satisfied, it happens to me every time
I look around instead of looking up
A better believer would look to the skies
Shout hallelujah with tears in his eyes
Open his heart and start givin' it all away
When I take a hard look at myself
And count my blessings I can't but help
But wonder if there's been some kind of mistake
Oh, this life of mine should belong to a better believer
With all I've got to be thankful for
I should be doing so much more I know
A better believer would look to the skies
Shout hallelujah with tears in his eyes
Open his heart and start givin' it all away
When I take a hard look at myself
And count my blessings I can't but help
But wonder if there's been some kind of mistake
Yeah, this life of mine should belong to a better believer
Oh, this life of mine should belong to a better believer
