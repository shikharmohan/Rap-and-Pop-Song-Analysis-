[Verse 1:]
Oh
Feels like I'm on a high speed chase
Running from the pressure of my day
Into your arms
I can escape
You make it ok
That's why I'm swtching lanes I
Ain't trying to play no games I
Can't wait to sit between your legs
While your legs
While you're massaging away
Girl I
Don't think you know how much I adore you
But when I'm finished
Girl I promise that you're going to
So in the meantime
Girl just be patient
And know that I'm accelerating.
Through everything but that red light
[Chorus:]
Going downtown (going downtown)
I got to see my baby
You way ahead of the game
You got me riding like vroom
On a yamaha
chromed out 1100
Racing to your love
Cause you got my motor running
[Hook:]
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom
You know I'm trying to get to
You, you, you, you
You know that I want you girl
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom
You know I gotta get to
You, you, you, you
Get to you
Get to you
[Verse 2:]
Now the anticipation taking over
Girl I gotta beat this song up for your love
I'm getting closer
Got me steady reminiscing 'bout your touch
I swear
Nights like this
I wish
That I had a private jet
So I can get where you are
I can feel us getting closer
Girl this love's just taking over
And I'm hotter than the heat anymore
Wanna beat it and I know you feel the same
Don't cha
Now that I'm only five minutes away
It's ok
Crack open that champagne
And get ready baby
[Chorus:]
Going downtown (going downtown)
I got to see my baby
You way ahead of the game
You got me riding like vroom
On a yamaha
chromed out eleven hundred
Racing to your love
Cause you got my motor running
[Hook:]
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom
You know I'm trying to get to
You, you, you, you
You know that I want you girl
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom
You know I gotta get to
You, you, you, you
Get to you
Get to you
[Bridge:]
Rev it up
Rev it up
I'm overlooking stop lights
(aww) rev it up
Rev it up
I hope the ones ain't out tonight
Rev it up
Rev it up
I can only imagine
What you got on
As soon as I open the door
Hurry up
I'm right out front
Rev it up
I hear slow jams bumping
Hurry up
Almost to your door
Girl I feel line running into your arms
Girl here I come
To you
And it was worth the wait
[Chorus:]
Going downtown (going downtown)
I got to see my baby
You way ahead of the game
You got me riding like vroom
On a yamaha
chrome out eleven hundred
Racing to your love
Cause you got my motor running
[Hook:]
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom
You know I'm trying to get to
You, you, you, you
You know that I want you girl
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom
You know I gotta get to
You, you, you, you
Get to you
Grt to you
Baby
Baby
Baby
