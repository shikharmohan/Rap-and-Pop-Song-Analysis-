Don't live a lie, this is your one life, oh
Don't live it like you won't get lost
Just walk, just walk
It's a liberty walk, it's a liberty walk
It's a liberty, liberty, liberty
It's a liberty walk, it's a liberty walk
It's a liberty, liberty, liberty
Here's to all the ones tryin' to hold you back
Tryin' to make you feel like you're less than that
Givin' nothing more better than to make you crack
But really just trying to put your dreams off track
And you know in the end it'll be okay
'Cause all it really matters are the steps you take
And everything else falls into place
There's no price to pay, I say
We're all right, yeah, yeah
We gonna get it, when we live it, live it
We're all right, yeah, yeah
We gonna get it, when we live it, oh, oh
It's a liberty walk, walk
Say goodbye to the people who tied you up
It's a liberty walk, walk
Feeling your heart again, breathing new oxygen
It's a liberty walk, walk
Free yourself, slam the door, not a prisoner anymore
Liberty, liberty, l-l-liberty, liberty, l-l
It's a liberty walk, walk, walk
Don't stop, keep on walking it
Don't stop, keep on talking
Don't stop, keep on walking it
Walk, walk
Don't be afraid to make a move
It won't hurt you just do
What you were born to do
And everything works out right
Don't listen to all the people who hate
'Cause all they do is help make your mistakes for you
But they don't own ya, I just told ya
All right, yeah, yeah
We're gonna get it, when we live it
We're all right, yeah, yeah
We're gonna get it, when we live it, oh, oh
It's a liberty walk, walk
Say goodbye to the people who tied you up
It's a liberty walk, walk
Feeling your heart again, breathing new oxygen
It's a liberty walk, walk
Free yourself, slam the door, not a prisoner anymore
Liberty, liberty, l-l-liberty, liberty, l-l
It's a liberty walk, walk, walk
Don't stop, keep on walking it
Don't stop, just walk this way
Don't stop, keep on walking it
Don't like, don't like
Don't like what you do
Don't take the abuse, move to the truth
People, come on that means you
It's a liberty walk, walk
Say goodbye to the people who tied you up
It's a liberty walk, walk
Feeling your heart again, breathing new oxygen
It's a liberty walk, walk
Free yourself, slam the door, not a prisoner anymore
Liberty, liberty, l-l-liberty, liberty, l-l
It's a liberty walk, walk, walk
Don't stop, keep on walking it
Don't stop, keep on talking
Don't stop, keep on walking it
Walk, walk, walk
Don't stop, keep on walking it
Don't stop, keep on talking
Don't stop, keep on walking it
Walk, walk, walk
