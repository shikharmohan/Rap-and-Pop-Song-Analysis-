tried to write a love song
i wanted it to be just right 
tried to make it beautiful 
but all i could think of was our last fight
i was going to play it on piano
have the drums come in real bold
but i couldn't think of anything good to say 
so the big ballot strings will never get played 
pretty melody i wrote will never get sanged
piece of paper i started with i threw away 
a song about our love will never see the light of day
why? 
cause you made it that way
ohhuhhohh yeah yeah 
you made it that way
i was gonna write you a love song 
but you screwed it all up 
playing games noow ya just a lame whos __ outta luck (crazy ass bitch)
i almost wrote you a love song

She threw my watch out the window
chain in her hand
she running threw the crib finding anything she can 
our relationship is not the only thing thats outta hand she even called my mama and said you need to get ya man cause ya son lying on me i aint trying to get a tan? 
and this the last time he'll have me crying in my hands so im heading to the club to try and find me a man. bitch you going to the club to try and find a man what is you saying had hoes in passionate night gowns but you the only one imagine in white gowns so where ya left hand you should let me add a ring to it. because mr & ms Anderson just has a ring to it she like why you act like that to me and walk right back mike jack  to me 
every time we fall out ill throw yo ass out but you just end up boomeranging  back to me. what the fuck 
i was gonna write you a love song 
but you screwed it all up 
playing games noow ya just a lame whos __ outta luck

i think you crazy crazy i think you need medication you should calm down you need meditation  sending me a text wiith a hundred exclamations about how im wrong without any explanation at all, before you say another nigga next up i should call a maid down cause i messed up but gave you what you needed even on them shopping sprees i would throw you paper like extra extra (read all about it) she said what if we reversed  roles and you were front roll cheering at my first shows and a couple dollar later and some louis vuitton clothes i can fuck a couple niggas thinking you said no 
if i had no feeling for them then it shouldnt hurt yours and since you never thought ill do it, it even hust more and ill lie about it and youll find out from the source who word was more truthful then yours. what would you do

oohhh yeah you made it that way 
ohhhh oh yeahh i was going to write you a love song but you screwed it all up playing games no your just a lame thats shit outta luck i almost wrote you a love song
