Let me talk to 'em
I guess you know you made it
When they started talking 'bout you, right?
Welcome to fame
Y'all don't pay me, no mind
I just gotta get some stuff off my chest, listen
Young, energetic, famous but don't really sweat it
Rich enough, fairly hot, so basically sex is not difficult to get
That ain't my fault, no, no, listen
And just 'cuz I might take advantage once or twice
People tell me I'm not right, thinking that sex was my life
But that just ain't me so let me clear it up
For those who have obviously misread the code, listen to me now
No, I am not
I'm not addicted to sex
But girl I guarantee that if you lay with me
You just might be
No, I am not
I'm not addicted to sex
But girl I guarantee that if you lay with me
You just might be
I wanna apologize
For bein' just a little freaky
I can't help it, it's just in me
But a problem it is not
I'm just fine y'all don't worry 'bout me, listen
And I wanna apologize
For bein' blessed with the ability to satisfy accurately
And quickly find the spot
Said it's a gift and a curse
Don't mess around find my number in your girlfriend's purse
No, I am not
I'm not addicted to sex
But girl I guarantee that if you lay with me
You just might be
No, I am not
I'm not addicted to sex
But girl I guarantee that if you lay with me
You just might be
I never been shy 'bout my self and sexuality
Never been taboo, yeah
I know it's something I could do
But I just really don't want to
No, I am not
I'm not addicted to sex
But girl I guarantee that if you lay with me
You just might be
No, I am not
I'm not addicted to sex
But girl I guarantee that if you lay with me
You just might be
