There's so many things, I didn't say
And even though it may be too late
I want you to know, I still love you so
Every car I meet, looks like your car
Every movie I see, you play the leading part
You're on my mind, can't leave you behind
When I close my eyes, you're all I see
In the dark of night, you're in my dreams
Throughout the day, you're easy to find
You're always there, when I close my eyes
In my mind I know, you're far away
But here in my heart, nothin' has changed
I'm still holdin' you, like I used to
On a busy street in a crowded room
Wherever I go, it's just me and you
Together again, girl, it never ends
When I close my eyes, you're all I see
In the dark of night, you're in my dreams
Throughout the day, you're easy to find
You're always there, when I close my eyes
You're always there, when I close my eyes
