She want it I can tell she want it
want me to push up on it
for she know when I'm all on it
we get the party going liquor flowing this is fire

(Jeremih)
Ok she headed to the dancefloor and she slowly start to poppin it
something like my wrist cause everybody got to watching it
girl you go that secret treasure I'm gon put that lock on it
don't care what they say I would be stupid to be not on it

and I'm gon lick it lick it lick it

(bang bang bang bang)
Oh you look so sweet

they must have been trippin to let me off the leash
(Jeremih Chorus)
I love the way you grind with that booty on me
shorty you a dime why you looking lonely

Systems thumping party jumping
shorty she's a perfect 10
she rock her hips than roll her hips
than drop it down like it's nothing
she shaped just like an hour glass
she see how fast an hour passed
time flys when I'm on that ass
but I won't put our sh-t on blast
work it like a pro pro pro
sit and watch it go go go
do her thing all on the floor
she bounce it fast and shake it slow
so sexual incredible
she beautiful she edible
I got her I won't let her go
I aint seen nothing better yo
look at how she twurk it
the way she work it
make me wanna hit it hit it
heaven when I'm in it in it
if I do not fit, I'm gonna make it
girl you can take it
don't stop get it get it
(Chorus)
(Jeremih)
Say you independant
get it from your momma
tell me if you with it
do you really wanna wanna
baby when you see me
you know I be on it
can you keep it open
put it all up on me
(x3)
(Chorus)
