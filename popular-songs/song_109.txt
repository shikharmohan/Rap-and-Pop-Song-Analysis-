Baby you're a wrecking ball, crashing into me
Nothing I can do but fall piece by piece
You broke down every part of me
That ever thought I would never need you, baby
It's twisted, messed up and the more I think about it
It's crazy but so what, I might never understand it
I'm caught up and I'm hanging on
I'm gonna love you, even if it's wrong
Everybody's telling me I'm over my head
But they don't feel you lovin' me
They all say I've gone crazy
Maybe, but it's too late to save me, I'm too tangled
It's twisted, messed up and the more I think about it
It's crazy but so what, I may never understand it
I'm caught up and I'm hanging on
I'm gonna love you even if it's wrong
Even if it's twisted, yeah
Maybe it's not right but that's alright
Yeah, it's alright tonight
It's twisted, messed up and the more I think about it
It's crazy but so what, I may never understand it
It's twisted, messed up and the more I think about it
It's crazy but so what, I may never understand it
I'm caught up and I'm hanging on
I'm gonna love you even if it's wrong
Even if it's twisted, even if it's just a little bit
Just a little bit, just a little twisted, yeah
It's twisted, yeah
