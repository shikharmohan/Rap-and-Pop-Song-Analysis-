[Intro]
I'm just a young boy, trying to get my money on 
Making music in K.C., he-he-he-he-he
But Mitch Bade nigga's, wanna hate Techa Nina, 
And they won't stop fucking with me, so I'ma fuck wit nigga's
Na-na-na-na-na, you can not fuck with
That nigga Tech N9ne, coming wit that rough shit
Them niggas know that I deserve it when they heard it
Had the nerve to say its nothing, nigga, so I got to bust this
Be Jealous, This is dedicated to all ya'll hater's
Be Jealous, I see ya'll watching me when I walk in the club
Be Jealous, This is dedicated to all Mitch Bader's
Be Jealous, You mother fucker's ain't showing Tech Nina no love
[Verse 1]
Fuck Muh-Fuckers, buck Muh-Fuckers
And the pain come nigga with a bang, I'ma killer, better duck Muh-Fucker
Watch you standing on? (Nada) What you claim to bone? (Nada)
What you plan to own? (Nada) That shit done came and gone
Blood sweat and tears nigga, been about fifteen years nigga
Ain't never been no fears nigga, All I hear is cheers nigga
That's why I be in the bathroom with the bitches at Maniacs
That's why them hoe's in the club with Tech given blowjobs in the back
How many niggas really worry bout scars? How many niggas wanna become a wuss?
Fuck with a nigga like Tech and a buzz Right to the head and the grave is dug
Mean Mugs, nigga's ain't never seen love
So they stream blood while I fiend bub full of green shrubs
And mushrooms, I bust rooms, open a custom
To float across the ocean with verbal motion the notion is boasting
I'm hoaking with jealous, mother fuckers embellish
But you can't say I ain't ready for fame, yonks, and relish
[Chorus]
Be Jealous, when you see me on the T.V. Screen whiling
Be Jealous, when you see me in the magazine smiling
Be Jealous, when they let me in the club for free, niggas
Be Jealous, 'cause I'm bumy wit bitches around me
Ha-ha, mother fucker, ha-ha (ha-ha)
Ha-ha, mother fucker, ha-ha (he-he-he-he)
Ha-ha, mother fucker, ha-ha (ha-ha)
And the lit, I'ma spit, I'ma kick that shit
[Verse 2]
No more stalling, I'ma start prowling on niggas, growling on niggas
And we smiling 'cause the Villain album went six thousand on niggas
In Kansas City alone, we packed the dome with Mike and Liddy alone
In the west side, Lee Jone, Milly Mal, I left you but it's a pity you're gone
Niggas ain't know mine, 'cause they know it, and I'ma do it big
That's why the Techa Nina never ever got a problem getting a gig
'cause I rip shit they liked (chea), I flip shit you make right (chea)
When I spit shit, I get rich quick, and make hits from doctors they liked (chea)
9 millimeter guns, gonna be the one, making a million, when I come
Never gonna be the bum, where I come from, niggas better get some
Tried to be right to these niggas, tried to be nice to these niggas
So now its time for Nine Godzilla to make mice of these niggas
You envy me, 'cause your bitch play Techa Nina all day
And you see me on MTV, kicking it with king Tech, my nigga sway
Broke niggas ain't friends to me, you niggas really want me to disperse?
Alright, I'll leave, but when I come back it's gonna be 20 G's a verse, nigga
[Chorus]
Be Jealous, when you see me on the T.V. Screen whiling
Be Jealous, when you see me in the magazine smiling
Be Jealous, when they let me in the club for free, niggas
Be Jealous, 'cause I'm bumy wit bitches around me
Ha-ha, mother fucker, ha-ha (ha-ha)
Ha-ha, mother fucker, ha-ha (he-he-he-he)
Ha-ha, mother fucker, ha-ha (ha-ha)
And the lit, I'ma spit, I'ma kick that shit
[Verse 3]
Niggas better stop talking about me, I ain't did shit
I don't rap against niggas, stop trying to get me to rap so ya'll can make grits
Agony, don't be speaking my name, I know I fucked up
On a personal tip, but if you niggas talking about you better rap, mother fuckers better duck
And if any of you niggas over there on the inside, infiltrating me and my rouges
Them niggas don't give no fucks about how many Tech N9ne units sold
And whoever you bitch niggas is saying, I'm kicking it in Lee Joes log
Lee Joe'll tell you I'm original, and by the way Lee Joe my dog!
And that justice mother fuckers won't quit, saying The Calm Before The StormÃÂ¢€Ã aint shit
We killed yall when 96-97, when about when the new shit hit
And I heard niggas said I was washed up, said the Tech N9ne flow was sleep
That's probably why I got new shit in new movies like Digging In Water and Its Too Deep
Niggas be jealous, tie you up and beat you down to a bloody pulp son
Got my villains and me, mad enough to bust one
I'm the second coming, but you don't know 'cause you dumb
Before I go, I'll tell you jealous mother fuckers to suck one
[Chorus]
Be Jealous, when you see me on the T.V. Screen whiling
Be Jealous, when you see me in the magazine smiling
Be Jealous, when they let me in the club for free, niggas
Be Jealous, 'cause I'm bumy wit bitches around me
Ha-ha, mother fucker, ha-ha (ha-ha)
Ha-ha, mother fucker, ha-ha (he-he-he-he)
Ha-ha, mother fucker, ha-ha (ha-ha)
And the lit, I'ma spit, I'ma kick that shit
