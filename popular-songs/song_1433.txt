Lookin' back now makes me laugh
We were growin' our hair, we were cuttin' class
Knew it all already there was nothin' to learn
We were strikin' matches just to watch em burn
Listening to our music just a little too loud
We were hangin' in there with the outkast crowd
Headin' to the rapids with some discount beer
It was a long train trestle but we had no fear
And man I don't know where the time goes
But it sure goes fast just like that
We were wanna be rebels who didn't have a clue
In our rock and roll t-shirts and our typically bad attitudes
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done
We were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly young, young
Talked a good game when we were out with the guys
But in the back seat we were awkward and shy
Girls were a mystery that we couldn't explain
And I guess there are somethings that are never gonna change
And man I don't know where the time goes
But it sure goes fast just like that
We were wanna be rebels who didn't have a clue
In our rock and roll t-shirts and our typically bad attitudes
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done
We were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly young, young
Young, ya we were wishin' we were older
Young, hey I wish it wasn't over
Man I don't know where the time goes
But it sure goes fast just like that
We were wanna be rebels who didn't have a clue
In our rock and roll t-shirts and our typically bad attitudes
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done
We were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly young, young
And wishin' we were older
And I wish it wasn't over
