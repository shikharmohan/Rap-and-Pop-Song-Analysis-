It gets harder everyday but I can't seem to shake the pain
I'm trying to find the words to say, please say
It's written all over my face
I can't function the same when you're not here
I'm calling your name and no one's there
And I hope one day you'll see nobody has it easy
I still can't believe you found somebody new
But I wish you the best, I guess
'Cause everybody knows that nobody really knows
How to make it work or how to ease the hurt
We've heard it all before everybody knows just how to make it right
I wish we gave it one more try, one more try, one more try
'Cause everybody knows but nobody really knows
I don't care what the people say, they're probably lonely anyway
Baby don't fill up your head with he said, she said
It seems like you just don't know, don't know
The radio's on, you tuning me out
I'm trying to speak, you're turning me down
And I hope one day you'll see, nobody has it easy
I still can't believe you found somebody new
But I wish you the best, I guess
'Cause everybody knows that nobody really knows
How to make it work or how to ease the hurt
We've heard it all before everybody knows just how to make it right
I wish we gave it one more try, one more try, one more try, one more try
'Cause everybody knows but nobody really knows
Oh, I wish you'd understand
Oh, just an ordinary man
Wish that we had known
Everybody knows but nobody really knows
And I know one day you'll see nobody has it easy
I still can't believe you found somebody knew
I wish you the best, I guess
'Cause everybody knows that nobody really knows
How to make it work or how to ease the hurt
We've heard it all before everybody knows just how to make it right
I wish we gave it one more try, one more try, one more try, one more try
'Cause everybody knows but nobody really knows
Nobody really knows, nobody really knows
