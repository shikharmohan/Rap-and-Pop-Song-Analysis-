All my life and the hereafter
I've never seen, seen one like you
You're a knife, sharp and deadly
And it's me that you cut into
But I don't mind, in fact, I like it
Though I'm terrified, I'm turned on but scared of you
She's a monster, beautiful monster
Beautiful monster but I don't mind
And I need her, said I need her
Beautiful monster but I don't mind
No, I don't mind
(I don't mind, I don't, I don't mind)
No, I don't mind
(I don't mind, I don't, I don't mind)
No, I don't mind
(I don't mind, I don't, I don't mind)
No, I don't mind
In her eyes, there's love and fire
In my heart, she's burning through
But I don't mind, in fact, I like it
Though I'm terrified, I'm turned on but scared of you
She's a monster, beautiful monster
Beautiful monster but I don't mind
And I need her, said I need her
Beautiful monster but I don't mind
And I need her, said I need her
Beautiful monster
But I don't mind
(I don't mind, I don't I don't mind)
No, I don't mind
Playing with my heart
And she's playing with my mind
And I don't mind, I don't, I don't mind
No, I don't mind, I don't, I don't mind
No, I don't mind, I don't, I don't mind
No, I don't mind, I don't, I don't mind
(I don't mind, I don't, I don't mind)
And I don't mind
(I don't mind, I don't, I don't mind)
Said I don't mind
(I don't mind, I don't, I don't mind)
Said I don't mind
(I don't mind, I don't, I don't mind)
Beautiful monster
She's a monster, beautiful monster
Beautiful monster but I don't mind
And I need her, said I need her
Beautiful monster but I don't mind
And I need her, said I need her
Beautiful monster
But I don't mind
(I don't mind, I don't I don't mind)
No, I don't mind
(Said I don't mind, I don't, I don't mind)
No, I don't mind
(I don't mind, I don't, I don't mind)
No, I don't mind
(I don't mind, I don't, I don't mind)
No, I don't mind
