Baby, come close let me tell you this
In a whisper my heart says you know it too
Baby, we both share a secret wish
And you feel my love reaching out to you
Timeless, don't let it end
(No)
Now that you're right here in my arms
Where you should stay
Hold tight, baby
Timeless, don't let it fade out of sight
Just let the moments sweep us both away
Lifting us to where we both agree
It's just timeless love
I see it all baby in your eyes
When you look at me, I know I feel it too
(Yes I do)
So let's sail away and meet forever, baby
Where the crystal ocean melts into the sky
We shouldn't let the moment pass
You making me shiver let's make it last
Why should we lose it? Don't ever let me go
Timeless, baby, it's timeless
Oh, baby it's timeless
Timeless, don't let it fade out of sight
Just let the moments sweep us both away
Lifting us to where we both agree
This is timeless, this is timeless
Love
