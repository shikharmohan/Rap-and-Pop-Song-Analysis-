These old boots still got a lot of ground, they ain't covered yet
There's at least another million miles under these old bus treads
So if you think I'm gonna settle down, huh
I've got news for you, and I've still got a lot of leaving left to do
And as long as there's a song left in this old guitar
This life I'm bound to lead, ain't for the faint of hearts
So you won't fall for me, ya know what's good for you
'Cause I still got a lot of leaving left to do
Guess the Lord made me hard to handle
So lovin' me might be a long shot gamble
So before you go and turn me on
Be sure that you can turn me loose
'Cause I still got a lot of leaving left to do
Girl, you look like you might be an Angel, so I won't lie
I could love you like the Devil, you wanted me to tonight
And we could talk about forever, for a day or two
But I still got a lot of leaving left to do
Guess the Lord made me hard to handle
So lovin' me might be a long shot gamble
So before you go and turn me on
And be sure that you can turn me loose
'Cause I still got a lot of leaving left to do
Yeah, I still got a lot of leaving left to do
