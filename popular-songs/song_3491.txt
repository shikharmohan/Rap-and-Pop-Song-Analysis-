Ashes
He's nothing but ashes
No feelings have lasted
No love remains
Ashes
That's all that our past is
He's nothing but ashes
From a cold old flame
I saw your face when
He waltzed in here
But those old embers
Haven't burned for years
The light that's shining
In my eyes
Is for the one that
I'm with tonight
Ashes
He's nothing but ashes
No feelings have lasted
No love remains
Ashes
That's all that our past is
He's nothing but ashes
From a cold old flame
No i don't blame you
For having some doubts
But when he left me
That fire burned out
So don't be thinking
There's still a spark
'cause he could never
Tear us apart
Ashes
He's nothing but ashes
No feelings have lasted
No love remains
Ashes
That's all that our past is
He's nothing but ashes
From a cold old flame
He's nothing but ashes
From a cold old flame
