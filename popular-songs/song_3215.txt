What you're about to witness
Is one of the best collaborations of all time
Kansas City's
Humboldt County's
Show 'em we are what we are (hey yo!)
When I rap no never know what the fewer, better
A mouth full of cheddar make a greedy setter
Got a mean vendetta, my team is too clever
Never ever gonna stop, 'cause I rock forever (forever)
You ain't never gonna see me when I be me
When it comes to the rhymes, can't beat me
All the girls say, you complete me
Even some 'em weekly wanna meet me (haha)
Bust on the scene like Jeezy (yeeeah)
And everybody want a Potluck CD
After the show, collect the dough
Then we go to the hotel blowin' smoke
You gonna hold the Po' because my flow is dope
Because I'm invincible, you can't sink the boat
Fuck American Idol, we rock hardcore bitch
Get stupid, get dumb, matter fact let's thizz
Underrated in about my peers
Put the pump in the back of the Benz
Quick better tell all your friends
It's Potluck and Tech N9ne rockin' again
And we rockin M-O with Krizz Kaliko
His flow is so cold, gotta go gold
And a lock in the do' like a fo-fo at a show
Man I'm never so-so
Under syllable criminal won't forget it but let it go
In the stereo, sure up and gettin' high
Motherfuckers starin' but pity for 'em baring
But when they lyric go and if you wanna bet 'em they gonna die
Now we gotta roll the riches (no lie)
Hanging up the colder bitches (don't cry)
Gotta stand in the street with my hand on my dick
Cause I wanna be sayin', I'm rich bitch (bitch!)
When I party with ya'll
We drinkin' Crown up at the bar
When I'm smokin' with ya'll
Take it to the head 'til we fall
And we duckin' the law
We hit them corners 'til they gone
See I'm fuckin' with ya'll, 'cause we are what we are
When I party with ya'll
We drinkin' Crown up at the bar
When I'm smokin' with ya'll
Take it to the head 'til we fall
And we duckin' the law
We hit them corners 'til they gone
See I'm fuckin' with ya'll, 'cause we are what we are
Anybody got another pill
I gotta get a motherfucker to give me the artificial loving
I wanna be trippin', I gotta be high
Tryin' to kick it hella wicked until we die,
Never the nigga to get a milli when I'm trippin' and buckin' it
I'm the nigga in the party with your bitch and I'm fuckin' it
But you gotta be ready to get up and go
If you wanna start up a fight over raggedy ho's
Me and Potluck, put the cocks up, in a hot slut
Tryin' to bust a nut before the slot locks up
Given a minute to get us up in it but everybody shiver when I deliver the jock pops up
Underrated he made it a bomb with the heat
Makin' it so it ain't never calm in the street
Tech the nigga with One Ton, nigga we come from nothin'
We bustin' like hell spawns on a bu-bu-bu-bu-beat
Verbally you heard of me, murder thee, mental capacity
Flippin' with Missouri in back of me, pack a B
Thinkin' I'm 'bout to be Tech attack a motherfucker with the tongue
Nigga you better be steadily bringin' the melody,
Readily, 'cause every nigga's thinkin' ahead of me
We'll never be fetty because I bring it like a bullet from a gun
So what you really wanna do?
Get back on the road, get a sack, crack a brew
Put a bitch in the back and I give her what she really
Want a motherfucker to makin' it do, what it do
With the Carrabou Lou, 151, Malabu Rum, and Pineapple Juice
You know the party gotta be fun, compatible groups of nigga's
Chillin' with your home girls in 707 with the liquor
When I party with ya'll
We drinkin' Crown up at the bar
When I'm smokin' with ya'll
Take it to the head 'til we fall
And we duckin' the law
We hit them corners 'til they gone
See I'm fuckin' with ya'll, 'cause we are what we are
When I party with ya'll
We drinkin' Crown up at the bar
When I'm smokin' with ya'll
Take it to the head 'til we fall
And we duckin' the law
We hit them corners 'til they gone
See I'm fuckin' with ya'll, 'cause we are what we are
Bartender can I get another round
With a little bit a ice and a lot more Crown
Keep it strong with the clowns when I'm in your town
Bet it all goes down, 'cause I got that sound
Say what I want to when I jump up on your rhythm
When I smoke better try Humboldt
Better hit 'til you cry and choke
Now know why I rhyme so dope
Party all day and night with a hoe
Gotta get that dough like I just passed go
Where the next show better be the best, yo
Kick it at the hotel, I just get so frisco
All the way to 'Isco, flow magic and I say presto
Let a nigga get a little sip of X-O
I pull the best one and tell the bitch let's go (come on)
I do what I do, rap what I be
Flow straight heat, gettin' high in the street
Got what I need, grow a mouth full of seed
You can take it from me, we the top of the peak
Do what I can for the fan, I am what I am, I'm another weed man
Green like a vegan, not a mean man
I don't gotta green thumb, I gotta whole green hand
When I party with ya'll
We drinkin' Crown up at the bar
When I'm smokin' with ya'll
Take it to the head 'til we fall
And we duckin' the law
We hit them corners 'til they gone
See I'm fuckin' with ya'll, 'cause we are what we are
When I party with ya'll
We drinkin' Crown up at the bar
When I'm smokin' with ya'll
Take it to the head 'til we fall
And we duckin' the law
We hit them corners 'til they gone
See I'm fuckin' with ya'll, 'cause we are what we are
