Rollin' into the fast lane on the leavin' side of town
Just me and the dreams I've left undone
There's a lot of roads that I could point this Chevy down
But I can only think of one
On this river of concrete slab a man could drive for days
And let his imagination run
There's time for a million memories along the way
But I can only think of one, oh I can only think of one
Summer down in Galveston underneath the stars
The fire burnin' on the sand, ragin' in our hearts
If there's a time in my whole life I've really been in love
I can only, I can only think of one
I'm not gonna turn back till I'm back to where you are
To undo the damage that's been done
There may be a hundred ways to mend this broken heart
But I can only think of one, oh I can only think of one
Summer down in Galveston underneath the stars
Fire burnin' in on the sand and you back in my arms
If there's a time in my whole life I've really been in love
I can only, I can only, I can only think of one
