Sure feels good, sure feels right
Sure enough feels like love tonight
There ain't no movie, there ain't no bar
Ain't nothin' out there, beats where we are
Lay back baby, catch your breath
This fire ain't as hot as it's gonna get
We're just getting started, ain't close to done
There's a whole lot more where that came from
We've been workin' so hard, had no breaks
Gotta lotta overdue to love to make
If we get no sleep, well, that's okay
'Bout time, you and me got this way
Well, lay back baby, catch your breath
This fire ain't as hot as it's gonna get
We're just getting started, ain't close to done
There's a whole lot more where that came from
Well, come on baby, we can't stop now
No givin' in 'til we both give out, hurray!
Yeah, lay back baby, catch your breath
This fire ain't as hot as it's gonna get
We're just getting started, ain't close to done
There's a whole lot more where that came from
We're just getting started, ain't this fun?
There's a whole lot more where that came from
Yeah, there's a whole lot more where that came from
Oh yeah
