[Chorus]
Ey

Silver dollar fresh I stay

(x2)
[Flo Rida: Verse 1]
Money in my pocket
He be talking I be quiet
There he go again smelling like I wanna buy it
Shawty think Im fresh I make em wet like fire hydrant
I be on that fly go from passenger to pilot
Point it out like gimme that
Point it out like gimme that
Point it out like gimme that, gimme that, and gimme that
Why do I be stuntin to be honest I dont know
Hundred after hundred after hundred I dont know
I love it l-love, love it I got a problem
Its nothin nothin nothin nothin Im poppin collars
Last week I flossed on em, bitch I made a movie
How you doin? Where you been? Hello to my groupies!
Swagga to the moon, man, 
Gaup in my two hands
You can eat the fruit loops wrist full of Toucans
All type of colors, We family like brothers
My cash and my clean, cant have one without the other
I stay...
[Chorus]
[Lil Wayne: Verse 2]
Man I got fishes at my home
and bitches on my phone
Im like can you call me back because SportsCenter is on
I dont mean to come off wrong
But man my money long
I say man my money long
Call me stretch Armstrong
Big ass chain on my junkyard dog shit
Viagra swagga, fuck all yall shit
haha, hey, Mike stop the beat
Hear the money talk and it talking about me, huh
White boy fresh, skinny ass pants
Boy I ball hard like scouts in the stands
I just sit around my house and blow a ounce like a fan
I flip one of these niggas like Jackie Chan
I aint worryin bout em
I just ball out, Man Im too cold let me thaw out
Im so Young Money... I got dumb money
Beaucoup bread but a bitch cant get a crumb from me.
[Chorus]
[Flo Rida: Verse 3]
Money in my pocket he ain't coming back to life
I gave him CPR blow thirty shooting dice
Im married to that cash like somebody throwing rice
Said Im married to that cash I just had to say it twice
Tell me I aint stuntin nah
Tell me I aint stuntin nah
Tell me I aint stuntin nah, nah, nah, nah, nah..
Put on for my city and I do it like I supposed to
Ballin like when Britney cut her hair I cut the checks fool
I do that d-d-d-do that, do that Im about my business
Like who dat who-who-who dat, who dat pushin the Bentley
Everybody staring thats Mister McLaren
Loco con dinero like-like I was speaking Spanish
Shine like a disco
Dimes thick as Crisco
Said she gotta twin then you know Im callin Brisco
I aint drink that Don P
I aint drink that Don P
Them shawties spill my bottle on my Parlay Adore jeans.
[Chorus]
