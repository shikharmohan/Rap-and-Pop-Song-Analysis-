Well the blues don't care who's got 'em
Tears don't care where they fall
And you don't care my heart is breakin' in two
No you and the blues don't care at all
Outside my window, it's raining
Somehow the rain seems right
Inside, my lonely heart is aching
Oh how I miss you tonight
Well the blues don't care who's got 'em
And the tears don't care where they fall
You don't care my heart is breakin' in two
No you and the blues don't care at all
The wind don't know where it's blowing
Rivers don't care where they flow
I don't know where I'm going
'Cause you don't care anymore
Well the blues don't care, oh who's got 'em
And the tears don't care where they fall
And you don't care my heart is breakin' in two
No you and the blues don't care at all
Oh darling you and the blues don't care at all
