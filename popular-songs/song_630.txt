This is where my story begins
Standin' here with you I'm about to give in
And I'ma give all I can give
Even though in previous relationships
I might have been mischievous
I wasn't always ready, I admit to this
But what a good feelin' it is
I had a lot of crushes close to nothin' like this
And every time the subject would come up
I made up every excuse that I could think of
I used to run but now I'm gettin' warmed up
In a few words this feelin' I could sum up
I need love for the first time in my life
I need love, ain't no love up in the club
I need love, wanna cuddle up to somethin'
And make me feel like I'm somethin'
Gettin' sick and tired of frontin'
I need love for the first time in my life
I need love, ain't no love up in the club
I need love, I wanna cuddle up to somethin'
And make me feel like I'm somethin'
Gettin' sick and tired of frontin', I need
I was hangin' out with my friends
Seven nights a week, if there's a party I'm in
But I started gettin' sick of it
And when I looked back I didn't know what it meant
I guess I wasn't interested
In findin' somethin' real though I was lookin' for it
You should have been lookin' for me
But you opened up my eyes and now I can see
And every time the subject would come up
When they say, "I love you", then I only dumb up
A lot of guys wanna [Incomprehensible] or shut up
But you're the only one who told me your love was endless
A lot of words with feelin' cannot sum up
But first I had to figure out who I was
To try and understand there ain't no shortcuts
Now the only thing that's missin' now is your love
I need love for the first time in my life
I need love, ain't no love up in the club
I need love, wanna cuddle up to somethin'
And make me feel like I'm somethin'
Gettin' sick and tired of frontin'
I need love for the first time in my life
I need love, ain't no love up in the club
I need love, I wanna cuddle up to somethin'
And make me feel like I'm somethin'
Gettin' sick and tired of frontin', I need
Slow dance, hold hands, all I want is romance
If it's real let me know it's real, baby, take a chance
'Cause I've been lookin' for a man who could understand me
And I got a lot of love to give, baby, don't you hear me?
Slow dance, hold hands, all I want is romance
If it's real let me know it's real, baby, take a chance
'Cause I've been lookin' for a man who could understand me
And I got a lot of love to give, baby, don't you hear me?
Love for the first time in my life
I need love
I need love, wanna cuddle up to somethin'
And make me feel like I'm somethin'
Gettin' sick and tired of frontin'
I need love for the first time in my life
I need love, ain't no love up in the club
I need love, I wanna cuddle up to somethin'
And make me feel like I'm somethin'
Gettin' sick and tired of frontin'
I need love for the first time in my life
I need love, ain't no love up in the club
I need love, I wanna cuddle up to somethin'
And make me feel like I'm somethin'
Gettin' sick and tired of frontin'
Slow dance, hold hands, all I want is romance
If it's real let me know it's real, baby, take a chance
'Cause I've been lookin' for a man who could understand me
And I got a lot of love to give, baby, don't you hear me? Love
