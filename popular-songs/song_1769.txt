You like to keep me on a chain, chain, chain
Change your mind or change your ways, ways, ways
You got me running through a maze, maze, maze
I know this isnÃÂ¢€t just a phase, phase, phase
You always pick me up
And then you hold me down
IÃÂ¢€ll never let you go
ÃÂ¢€ÃCause baby even though you beat me up, beat me up
I still love you ÃÂ¢€Ãcause you heat me up, heat me up
And thatÃÂ¢€s why every time you hit me up, hit me up
I come running ÃÂ¢€Ãcause you fix me up, fix me up
Oh baby just beat me up, beat me up
Oh baby just beat me up, beat me up
You always make me do those things, things, things
Shut me up then make me sing, sing, sing
You love it when I scream your name, name, name
But you get your kicks out of causing me pain, pain, pain
You always pick me up
And then you hold me down
I guess youÃÂ¢€ll never know
ÃÂ¢€ÃCause baby even though you beat me up, beat me up
I still love you ÃÂ¢€Ãcause you heat me up, heat me up
And thatÃÂ¢€s why every time you hit me up, hit me up
I come running ÃÂ¢€Ãcause you fix me up, fix me up
Oh baby just beat me up, beat me up
Oh baby just beat me up, beat me up
Oh baby just beat me up, beat me up
I love you even though you beat me up, beat me up
And I really donÃÂ¢€t care what they say about me
ÃÂ¢€ÃCause it gives me everything I want
And I donÃÂ¢€t know what itÃÂ¢€s like when you need somebody
To the point they can do no wrong
We always fight and then I open up my door
ÃÂ¢€ÃCause baby even though you beat me up, beat me up
I still love you ÃÂ¢€Ãcause heat me up, heat me up
And thatÃÂ¢€s why every time you hit me up, hit me up
I come running ÃÂ¢€Ãcause you fix me up, fix me up
Oh baby just beat me up, beat me up
I still love you ÃÂ¢€Ãcause heat me up, heat me up
And thatÃÂ¢€s why every time you hit me up, hit me up
I come running ÃÂ¢€Ãcause you fix me up, fix me up
Oh baby just beat me up, beat me up
Oh baby just beat me up, beat me up
Oh baby just beat me up, beat me up
I love you even though you beat me up, beat me up
