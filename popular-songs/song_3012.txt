When our check bounces at the store
When the whole world seems at war
You bring me peace of mind once more
With just a little love
When the boss says, I'm ten minutes late
And the stack of bills just won't wait
Ooh, you take the worries away
With just a little love
Just a little love and affection
You bring a touch of perfection
To a world that's sometimes crazy
And so mixed up
Just a little love, you have changed me
You make me see why the good Lord made me
And you can do miracles
With just a little love
When our old car won't run
And all my dreams come undone
You'll make it right, won't ya hun
With just a little love
When it seems like all the truths are gone
When I'm trying so hard to hold on
You make it easy to be strong
With just a little love
Just a little love and affection
You bring a touch of perfection
To a world that's sometimes crazy
And so mixed up
Just a little love, you have changed me
You make me see why the good Lord made me
You can do miracles
With just a little love
