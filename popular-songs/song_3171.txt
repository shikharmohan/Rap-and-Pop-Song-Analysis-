[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Hahahaha, in the world of BET
I'm looked at as too rock and roll huh,
In the world of MTV
My name is too gangsta hard, hahaha
Man, Strange Music we got this baby
This year we got this one baby
Red hair, red everything
It's Tech N9ne baby like it or not
[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Never been a harder rhymer in my region globally thats holdin' me I'm totally hard and bossed up
Why you think that the majority of the rap musical authority sword me and barr'd and crossed 'em
Cause they don't wanna let the crazy kid in then
Spit his hymns speakin' a grim religion
Of rhyme, forbidden my ism's are hidden
My mind, to written then spittin' the kid in
The N9ne, is playin' you, slayin' you, sprayin' you, permanently delayin' you, swayin' through
It's the gay in you that's hatin' who somethin' that hella beyond us
(I love Kanye, his shit is bombay, but I'm rough)
And you can see it in my retina
That I won't be lettin' ya
Threatin' us better respect Tech the messenga
Too dope on em for this to be
History listen it's a mystery
While they spittin' and dissin' me
[Hook: Tech N9ne & Big Krizz Kalico]
This is me (this is me)
I'm a king, I'm a clown, I'm a G (I'm a G)
I believe what I want
Got you singin' my song
But your seein' me wrong
So what's a matter with me?
This is the belief (the belief)
The religion has arisen from the deep (from the deep)
Darkest prison if you listen you will see (you will see)
If collision's your decision you will reep what you sew, so forget what you know this is me
[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
This is Tech bra
For years I've been the next to collect a plethora of checks lets get extra
Is what I set ta
Travis let's go select the baddest rappers infect the planet leave 'em in exta
See I'm a vet the powers don't really wanna let the best
come and wreck yah sets and test your sector
Instead of rawness like Inspecta Deckta
Eldest rather set they specs on Mason Betha
Slept on my records
If you knew my music's Hannibal lecta
What the hell you callin' for Masta Flex for?
Don't pester me I won't sweet you be on a quest to
Investigate your techma respect the
Chakra, tease in hop to these
Hot degrees me and Mr. O apostrophe
Never listen to these papacies cause they suck!
(I love 50 Cent he gritty went he vent but I'm rough)
And you can see it in my demeanor
The Tecca Nina will blast arenas
The grass is greena
Made it ma on top of the world
Kiss me, miss me (This Is Me)
Can't you see?
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
The industry treat me like a ride on the short bus
That's why I'm tellin' they youngstas when you retort cuss
And make your fort fuss
Cause you went out on Sam Goody on F.Y.E. with they money and you support us
Strangas, Shadies, Psychopaths and Juggalos
Losah's, Shootas, College women and ghetto hoes
Rock it from precious dough
Drop's it just lets it flow
Cop it don't knock it you block it stop at the record sto'
This is Aaron Yates thizlely in rain
This is for little Donnie, this is for all Lequoia's pain
This is, for the sickness of Marty Sue
This is for all the love of Sarah, Susie, Ira-Mae and Aizzyda Lou
This is for Ike and Ricky
Rufus Rhonda, Barbara, and Marla really
This is for B'zle and I know that rest of my family is with me
This is my friends, this is the end, this is the G
This is life, this is wrong, this right, this is me
[Hook - 2X]
