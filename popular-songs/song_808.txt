I pray for better days to come
I pray that I would see the sun
'Cause life is so burdensome
When every day's a rainy one
But suddenly there's no more clouds
I believe without a doubt
That Heaven sent an angel down
Then she turned my life around
You know and I know
Friends come and friends go
Storms rise and winds blow
But one thing I know for sure
When it's cold outside
There's no need to worry
'Cause I'm so warm inside
You give me peace
When the storm's outside
'Cause we're in love I know
It'll be alright
Alright it's alright
Now peace is so hard to find
We're terrorized and victimized
But that's when I close my eyes
And think of you to ease my mind
You take me to another place
There's no more war just love and grace
  (No more war)
Baby you restore my faith
I know the struggles not in vain
You know and I know
Through all the battles
Baghdad to Israel
There's one thing I know for sure
When it's cold outside
There's no need to worry
'Cause I'm so warm inside
You give me peace
When the storm's outside
'Cause we're in love I know
It'll be alright
Alright, it's alright
Alright, it's alright
Alright, it's alright
Alright, it's alright
When it's cold outside
There's no need to worry
'Cause I'm so warm inside
You give me peace
When the storm's outside
'Cause we're in love I know
It'll be alright
Alright, it's alright
Oh it's gonna be alright
'Cause you give me peace
In the middle of the storm
When it's cold
You're keepin' me warm
It's alright, it's alright
I'm never gonna leave
You give me what I need
It's alright, it's alright
