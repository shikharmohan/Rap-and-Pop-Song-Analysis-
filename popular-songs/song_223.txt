I ride like a soldier put nothin' before ya
Anything you ask I'll be right there to do it
But by react, you tell me to relax
Too late to take you back 'cause boy you put me through it
This circular motion is all we do
I'm so sick of going back and forth with you
You should have been happy to have me
Said you wanted to have some kids, build a family
I wish it wasn't true, it's killing me to do
What I gotta do, the problem here is you
Ain't nobody new, not even my crew
Could take the place of you, the problem here is you
'Cause if you only knew what I felt for you
You would've held on tighter, fought a little harder
Been a little smarter and now you're gonna miss my love
And one day soon you'll see, you'll reach out for me
Boy, you had a keeper, didn't know how to treat her
Should've dug a little deeper and now you're gonna miss my love
Kick it with ya friends, go out with other chicks
Be all up in the mix, you got the right to do it
You wanna be a pimp, be treated like a prince
Go 'head and flip the switch 'cause now you got ya crown back
This circular motion is all we do
I'm so sick of going back and forth with you
You should have been happy to have me
Said you wanted to have some kids, build a family
I wish it wasn't true, it's killing me to do
What I gotta do, the problem here is you
Ain't nobody new, not even my crew
Could take the place of you, the problem here is you
'Cause if you only knew what I felt for you
You would've held on tighter, fought a little harder
Been a little smarter and now you're gonna miss my love
And one day soon you'll see, you'll reach out for me
Boy, you had a keeper, didn't know how to treat her
Should've dug a little deeper and now you're gonna miss my love
My hugs and my kisses
You know you're gonna miss it
And while you're trippin' on the love we could've had
Movin' on I got to and ain't no lookin' back
'Cause if you only knew what I felt for you
You would've held on tighter, fought a little harder
Been a little smarter and now you're gonna miss my love
And one day soon you'll see, you'll reach out for me
Boy, you had a keeper, didn't know how to treat her
Should've dug a little deeper and now you're gonna miss my love
My love, my love
See boy, you had a keeper but you didn't know how to treat her
