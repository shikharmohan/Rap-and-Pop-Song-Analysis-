(brett jones)
His head turned and my heart jumped.
When I saw that it was him.
After two long years the love of my life.
And I just held my breath in.
Standin' there smiling.
While his eyes locked on mine.
He couldn't hear me screamin on the inside.
Chorus
When I said, tear don't you fall.
He's done let him go.
Eye's don't look back.
Down that empty road.
And lips you may move.
But don't you say too much.
Oh and please, please heart hush.
I said somethin' stupid.
And reached out my hand.
After makin' love and movin' earth. we were shakin' hands.
A million sweet memoriers. pinballed through my brain.
The want to hold him one more time. ran through my veins.
Repeat chorus
I kept lookin' at my watch like I had somewhere to be.
Then he stopped talkin' and kissed me tenderly.
Repeat chorus
