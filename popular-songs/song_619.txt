Do it, do it
You do it, do it
You're doin' it well
Here's the thing
I was mindin' my own business, doin' what I do
I wasn't tryna look for anythin'
All of a sudden couldn't take my eyes off you
I didn't even know if you could tell
That you had me in a daze sayin' what the hell
Here's my name, number, baby, just hit my cell
Lovin' everything you do 'cause you do it well
Don't know what you got me thinkin'
You ain't even tryna play me, boy
'Cause you're so good and you're so fine
Got me sayin' crazy things, listen
I ain't ever met a man like that
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy you do it, do it, you do it, do it
You're doin' it well
I ain't ever met a man like that
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy, you do it, do it, you do it, do it
You're doin' it well
Let me tell you how it's gonna go
You and me gonna need a little privacy
I don't wanna do the dance, no do-si-do
I need a one woman man seven days a week
Quit tryna play it cool, boy, make your move
I told you how it is, nothin' to lose
You been starin' over here all night for free
And I ain't takin' no cash or credit, just a guarantee
There ain't nobody else for me, boy
You ain't even tryna play me, boy
'Cause you're so good and you're so fine
Got me sayin' crazy things, listen
I ain't ever met a man like that
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy, you do it, do it, you do it, do it
You're doin' it well
I ain't ever met a man like that
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy, you do it, do it, you do it, do it
You're doin' it well
Baby, no need for false pretenses
Think you just shocked me to my senses
Everything that you do feels right
Do it, do it, do it, do it all night
No need for false pretenses
Just shocked me to my senses
Everything that you do feels right
Do it, do it, do it, do it all night
I ain't ever met a man like that
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast
You can turn me on, throw me off track
'Cause you do it, do it, you do it, do it
You're doin' it well
I ain't ever met a man like that
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy, you do it, do it, you do it, do it
You're doin' it well
I ain't ever met a man like that
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy, you do it, do it, you do it, do it
You're doin' it well
I ain't ever met a man like that
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy, you do it, do it, you do it, do it
You're doin' it well
