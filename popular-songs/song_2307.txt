[Verse 1:]
Ice Cold. I Found A Pot Of Gold.
Shawty What Yo Name Is? (Shawty What Yo Name Is?)
Lookin' At You Make Me Feel Nervous A Little Bit.
Shawty Who You Came With? (Shawty Who You Came With?) (Oh-Oh Oh-Oh)
[Chorus:]
Girl You Make My Eyes Pop Out Like A Camera Lens.
You Ain't Even Gotta Get Closer, I'm Zoomin' In.
Baby Girl, I Can't Look Away For A Little Bit.
Think I Might Miss Somethin' I Need To See: Eye Candy.
Oh-Ooh. Baby Girl, I'm Losing Control.
And I Can't Help It, NO!
My Eyes Are Like Camera Lenses.
As Soon As I Blink: "Click, Click".
Girl, That's It.
And I Can't Focus.
[Verse 2:]
Wait! Slow Down A Little Bit.
Baby, Let Me Take You In.(Baby, Let Me Take You In.)
Let Me Take My Camera Lens, Point It At Your Frame And Then... "Click, Click, Click".
Got Your Body Right Where I Want It.
[Chorus:]
Girl, You Make My Eyes Pop Out Like A Camera Lens.
You Ain't Even Gotta Get Closer, I'm Zoomin' In.
Baby Girl, I Can't Look Away For A Little Bit.
Think I Might Miss Somethin' I Need To See: Eye Candy.
[Bridge:]
You're A Visual Spectical.
Got A Mental Picture... In My Mind.
Me And You Gettin' Physical.
Don't Make It Difficult.
Cause I Can Only See Ya... Easily.
Girl, Ya Got Me Losin' My Focus.
[Repeat:] Oh-Ooh. Baby Girl, I'm Losin' Control
