I was born a beast
You don't wanna meet
I'm the worst, a lot of women see the demon in me
Still they want a piece/ They want me chronally
 A lot of them really searchin for the seman in me
I let em know at the front of a lust demon that wanna be bust kitty, be rubbin, I love many
They trust me with the cunt, I thrust plenty, n jump in the next city, they wanted me, just kidding
But I can never tell a lie, if you looked into my eyes, you can see that I'm a - 
Angel
Demon
Lookin for the love in every thigh, makin you wanna cry, spirit'll be
Strangled
Screamin
That, I'm a serial killer, when it come to heart break 
Hate n the fury ya better cynic in the smarts makin
Everything wrong, everything is gone, so why do you say you will for ever ding dong
That just will make ya much meana
Thats sum mistake ta love Ninna
It sucks ta hate the one thing that makes ya come clean, then breaks n just leave ya
I'm just a fucked up individual
I love lust, n crushin ya for an interval
Plus bust a guts up in a centerfold
Eating the meeting up like its a dinner roll
Ya should'a kept away like I told ya
How can ya press to stay when I'm rove'a
I think its safe ta say that my fates ta lay n I'mma waste when I'm olda
So just step n gimmie the cold shoulda
Cuz I'm a mess, the Ninnas the most vulga
N I'm a threat, ya never get no close'a
My kiss is killing you, wake up n its ov'a
Why can't you see me, for the animal I am?!
I warned you!
Exposed my beast inside, NEXT IF you are willing to (willing to, willing to, willing to)
You took my invitation in. They all told ya never to take me in
Why can't you wake up n see that I am killing you?! (killing you, killing you, killing you)
I never knew why I had to be so cold
Inside'a me so froze, its gatta be no soul 
Because whenever the lady want me in oath mode, I put on my ghost clothes, n get on a close road
I'm tryin ta tell you that I'm sick in the insephalon
I thought I could doit, but I guess I'm weak, n never bond 
As long as I'm chasin the gold like a leprachaun
My heart'll be covered in cold ice intephalon
I'm sick wit'it
I'm brick wit'it
N9ne twist-ed it 
Ten times outta ten if you lookin for what it stems, I can guarantee that you gonn' find a bitch did it
But I'm takin it back, I wont blame it on you
Cuz I be the one that be gamin on you 
Famous, n heanous, the pain in you, cuz I'm blatently playin n laying the crew
I aint proud'a whut I turned into 
All my fire keeps burning through, burning you 
Up in the inside, I'm knowin the heat is concerning you 
I don't know whats gonna become of me
All I can say is don't anyone love me
Because I'm a monster, I'm sick n I want'cha
But'chu better back up n when I COME SHOVE ME
But then again I really really need you
I want up inside'a you, I wanna bleed you
Get the last drop then I'mma leave you 
Every last one'a you, yeah I'mma speed through
Clever n every lady wanna see you/ Open up wide I wanna feed you
Into the pit of evilness, I'mma lead you
I'M ANIMAL, TECH WHUT I'M LIKE WHEN I LACE YOU!
Why can't you see me, for the animal I am?!
I warned you!
Exposed my beast inside, yes dear you are willing to (willing to, willing to, willing to)
You took my invitation in. They all told ya never to take me in
Why can't you wake up n see that I am killing you?! (killing you, killing you, killing you)
