There's a spirit of a storm in my soul
A restlessness that I can't seem to tame
Thunder and lightning follow everywhere I go
There's a spirit of a storm in my soul
There's a hurricane that's raging through my blood
And I can't find a way to calm the sea
Maybe I'll find someday the waters aren't so rough
But right now they've got the best of me
And oh, it's been a long, long time
Since I've had real peace of mind
So I'm just gonna sit right here
In this old chair, until this storm rolls by
And oh, maybe it's just the way I am
And maybe I won't ever change
So I'm just gonna sit right here
In this old chair, and just soak up the rain
There's a spirit of a storm in my soul
Every time I think it's gone away
The dark clouds gather, that old wind begins to blow
The sun is gonna shine some day I hope
But there's a spirit of a storm in my soul
In my soul
