I'd spent a lot more time out in the pouring rain
Without an umbrella, covering my head
And I'd stood up to that bully when he pushed
And called me names but I was too afraid
And I'd gone on and saw Elvis that night
He came to town, mama said I couldn't
And I'd went skinny dipping with Jenny Carson that time
She dared me to but I didn't
Oh I, I'd done a lot of things different
I wish I'd spent more time with my dad
When he was alive, now I don't have the chance
And I wish I'd told my brother how much I loved him
Before he went off to war but I just shook his hand
I wish I'd gone to church on Sunday morning
When my grandma begged me to but I was afraid of God
And I wish I would of listened when they said
Boy you're gonna wish you hadn't but I wouldn't
Oh I, I'd done a lot of things different
People say they wouldn't change a thing
Even if they could, oh but I would
There was this red dress she wanted one time
So bad she could taste it, I shoulda bought it, but I didn't
She wanted to paint our bedroom yellow and trim it in blues and greens
But I wouldn't let her, it wouldn't hurt nothing
She loved to be held and kissed and touched
But I didn't do it, not nearly enough
And If I'd had known that dance was gonna be our last dance
I'd asked that band to play on and on, on and on
Oh I, I'd done a lot of things different
People say they wouldn't change a thing
Even if they could, oh but I would, oh
Oh I, I'd done a lot of things different
Oh I, I'd done a lot of things
I think we'd all do a lot of things different
