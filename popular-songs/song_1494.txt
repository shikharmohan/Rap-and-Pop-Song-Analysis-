I've been up to my neck workin' six days a week
Wearin' holes in the soles of the shoes on my feet
Been dreamin' of gettin' away since I don't know
Ain't no better time than now for Mexico
And no shoes, no shirt, no problems
Blues what blues hey I forgot them
The sun and the sand and a drink in my hand with no bottom
And no shoes, no shirt, and no problems, no problems
Want a towel on a chair in the sand by the sea
Want to look thru my shades and see you there with me
Want to soak up life for a while in laid back mode
No boss, no clocks, no stress, no dress code
And no shoes, no shirt, no problems
Blues what blues hey I forgot them
The sun and the sand and a drink in my hand with no bottom
And no shoes, no shirt, and no problems
Babe lets get packed tank tops and flip flops if you got them
No shoes, no shirt and no problems, no problems
