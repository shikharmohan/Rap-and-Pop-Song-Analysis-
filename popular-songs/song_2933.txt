College kids turning twenty-one
And their senior year spring break was here
They headed south but not for sun
On their skin where the storms had been
It was hard fixing windows
And shingles and doors
And tide never felt so good before
Everyday people
Are the ones who are making miracles
And it's beautiful
Everyday people
Lifting up the world like an answered prayer
I thank God they're there
They're the ones who care
Everyday people
Doctor said, "Good news, we caught it soon enough
We can clear this up"
But she's thirty and single with two kids to raise
Times are tough these days
So her friends made some calls
And the word spread around
How her bills got paid she don't know how
Everyday people
Are the ones who are making miracles
And it's beautiful
Everyday people
Lifting up the world like an answered prayer
I thank God they're there
They're the ones who care
Everyday people
Everyday people
A little girl takes her mama's hand
And walks inside saying, please don't cry
As the people who built this house just for them
Laugh through the tears as a family moves in
Everyday people
Are the ones who are making miracles
And it's beautiful
Everyday people
Lifting up the world like an answered prayer
I thank God they're there
They're the ones who care
Everyday people
Everyday people
Everyday people
