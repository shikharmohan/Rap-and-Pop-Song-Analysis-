I done cut the braids, low cut, got my grown on
Had a system label gettin money, money long long
I be so L.A. got my chucks and my Locs on
I was in MIA, and MIA superman on
I know I got it, I know she on it
I know you see it, I know she want it
She got dat Cali good
And she kinda hood
She got me policein, wishin dat a nigga would
This lil mama got her back right
She be skatin on it, got a nigga singin flashlight
He  trying to get her but she be holdin on hella tight
I got dat act right, dats what she like
chorus
I get it in, I get it in, I get it in, I get it up in da game
I get it in, I get it in, I get it in, I get up in the thing. Get it
Omarion
Done wit them boys, boys, she done found a man now
Aint no compettion, she fumble when it hangs down
Ima show her love, love even when when my fans round
Cuz if u get into da music, baby tell me how my bass sound
I know I got it, I know she on it
I know u see it, I know she want it
She got dat Cali good
And she kinda hood
She got me policein, wishin dat a nigga would
This lil mama got her back right
She be skatin on it, got a nigga seein flashlights
He be trying to get her but she be holdin on hella tight
I got dat act right, dats what she like
Chorus (gucci mane)
Tennis shoes, fur coat, Louie vee carry on

and dont want me to buy her none, man she done fired em!

Champagne wishes, private jet kisses, Shanghai, Bangkok
