I may not have a whole lot of money
But I got enough girl for you and me
I'm takin' off won't you come with me honey
Gonna take you all the way to Paris, Tennessee
I wanna show you the Riviera
Got good tires and a good CB
Put on some lipstick your mascara
'Cause we're goin' all the way to Paris, Tennessee
Baby I adore you
And don't say I've never
Done nothin' for you
Girl, that just ain't true
Here we go
Baby I adore you
And don't say I've never
Done nothin' for you
Girl, that just ain't true
We might not see no Eiffel Tower
But I got a cousin that I want you to meet
He can pick the wild wood flower
Better than anybody down in Paris, Tennessee
We're goin' all the way to Paris, Tennessee
Oh, la-la, baby
Vous le vous
Barbecue
