Baby, I go too fast, too far
Let's get it straight now, the way things are
I'm not the white knight in your fantasy
But I could be your wildest dream
I might ride with the wind, I might follow the sun
I gotta go where I've never been
'Cause my heart beats to a different drum
It's just the way I was made
I'm a renegade, I'm a renegade
I get this feelin' that I should be gone
Somethin' keeps tellin' me to take you along
I got a Chevy with a big back seat
Climb on in and take a chance on me
I might ride with the wind, I might follow the sun
I gotta go where I've never been
My heart beats to a different drum
It's just the way I was made
I'm a renegade, I'm a renegade
Don't even think about settlin' down
Ain't gonna hang my hat in no hometown
I might ride with the wind, I might follow the sun
I gotta go where I've never been
My heart beats to a different drum
It's just the way I was made
I'm a renegade, I'm a renegade
I'm a renegade, I'm a renegade
