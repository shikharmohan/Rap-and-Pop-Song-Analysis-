You know that restaurant on highway 1
With the key lime pie that song the sand and the sun
Where we ran in our bare feet built a castle on the beach
Just the wind, the rocks, the waves and you and me
I can't go there 'cause thats just too much us
I can't go there, I still feel your touch
Theres places in my heart and head that feel as empty as our bed
So most nights I don't even walk upstairs 'cause I can't go there
Remember San Francisco on that cable car
Our reflection in the window of that store
How we danced the night away with the lights out on the bay
Then wound up in a blanket on the floor
I can't go there 'cause Frisco's too much us
I can't go there, I still feel your touch
Now there's places in my heart and head
That still feel as empty as our bed
So most nights i don't even walk upstairs 'cause I can't go there
If it was only Florida or California
Maybe I could let myself move on
But it's everywhere we've been and everywhere I turn
I can't love again because I've learned
That I can't go there, it's somethin' I can't do
I can't go there, I'll run into you
I can't go there
When the sun shines, when it rains
Christmas party's, football games
I can't go there
Winter, summer, fall or spring
I see you in everything
I can't go there, it's too much us
I can't go there
