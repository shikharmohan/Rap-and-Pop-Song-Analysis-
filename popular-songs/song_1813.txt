It's been in the past for a while
I get a flash then I smile
Am I crazy?
Still miss you, baby
It was real, it was right
But it burned to have to survive
All that's left is
All these ashes
Where does the love go? I don't know
When it's all said and done
How could I be losing you forever?
After all the time we spent together
I have to know why I had to lose you
Now you've just become
Like everything I'll never find again
At the bottom of the ocean
In a dream you appeared
For a while you were here
So I keep sleeping
Just to keep you with me
I'll draw a map, connect the dots
With all the memories that I've got
What I'm missing
I'll keep reliving
Where does the love go? I don't know
When it's all said and done
How could I be losing you forever?
After all the time we spent together
I have to know why I had to lose you
Now you've just become
Like everything I'll never find again
At the bottom of the ocean
This is it
Let go
Breathe
You don't have to love me
For me to, baby, ever understand
Just know of all the time that we both had
And I don't ever wanna see you sad, be happy
I don't wanna hold you
If you don't wanna tell me you love me, babe
Just know I'm gonna have to walk away
I'll be big enough for both of us to say, be happy
Be happy
Be happy
Be happy
Be happy
