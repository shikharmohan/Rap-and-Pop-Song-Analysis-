When you've climbed the highest mountain
When a cloud holds the sunshine in
Suddenly there's a valley
Where the earth knows peace with men
When a star hides the distant rainbow
And you think you can't find a friend
Suddenly there's a valley
Where friendships never end
Touched only by the season
Swept clean by the raving rain
Surveyed by every bluebird
And kissed by the falling rain
When you think there's no bright tomorrow
And you feel you can't try again
Suddenly there's a valley
Where hope and love begin
Suddenly there's a valley
Where hope and love begin
