You told me I was one in a million
Everything that you wanted in this world
When every time I turn around, I hear tell you paint the town
With the one of those million other girls
Oh, what you do to me is not the question
I swear, I felt the magic from the start
I see the promise of a legendary love
But I am not about to share your heart
Oh I'd do almost anything just to make you mine
But I won't stand in line
I won't stand in line waiting for your call
I won't take a number, just to take a fall
So make up your mind, I won't stand in line
How long do you think that you can handle?
Keeping all those hearts up in the air
Don't you know in time you're bound to stumble
And when that day comes it won't be my affair
Oh I'd do almost anything just to make you mine
But I won't stand in line
I won't stand in line waiting for your call
I won't take a number, just to take a fall
So make up your mind, I won't stand in line
Oh I'd do almost anything just to make you mine
But I won't stand in line
I won't stand in line waiting for your call
I won't take your number, just to take a fall
So make up your mind, I won't stand in line
Oh I won't stand in line
I won't stand in line, I won't stand in line
Oh I'd do almost anything if I could make you mine
But I won't stand in line, I won't stand in line
Oh I'd do almost anything if I could make you mine
But I won't stand in line, I won't stand in line
I won't stand in line, I won't stand in line
Oh I'd do almost anything if I could make you mine
But now I won't stand in line
