Don't be so paranoid, don't be so
Baby, don't worry about it
Hey there, don't even think about it
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
All of the time, you really wanna spend your whole life alone
A little time out might do ya good, might do us good
Before you're done for good because I could make it good
I could make it hood, I could make you come

All of the time, you wanna complain about the nights alone
So now you here with me, social gratitude
Leave the attitude way back at home
Yeah, you see 'em look, baby, let 'em look
Give you cold looks 'cause we look cold
Yeah, you heard about all the word of mouth
Don't worry about what we can't control
All the talk in the world, loss in the world
'Til you finally let that thing go
You wanna check into the Heartbreak Hotel but sorry we're closed
Baby, don't worry 'bout it
Baby, we'll go out to the floor
Anyway

Lady, don't even think about it
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong thing
You worry 'bout the wrong thing, the wrong thing
You worry 'bout the wrong thing, the wrong thing
