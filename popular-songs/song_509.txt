She's That girl (yeah), who dances everywhere
Like I don't care, She's so excited
And I'm that guy, that loves the women - girl can be herself
Its so exciting
Now she don't worry bout what people think bout her cause she fly
When everbody on the floor goes left and then she goes right
And i think that its possible for the beat, dance it all night
All night long
She don't know how to uhhh, she dont know how to act, no x3
She goin crazy, she, she goin crazy on the floor
She's that girl, who wants to dance with me
And i'm that guy, to let her do it
And her friend, is at the life she spent to be herself
Thats not exciting
Now she don't worry bout what people think bout her cause she fly
When everbody on the floor goes left and then she goes right
And i think that its possible for the beat, dance it all night
All night long
She don't know how to uhhh, she dont know how to act, no x3
She goin crazy, she, she goin crazy on the floor
Floor...
she goin crazy she, she goin crazy on the floor
Got a ??? boy shorts, and long boy socks
she's having fun
she didn't do it for people to watch
she's number one
And her mind in the club, she didn't come for love
she came to party, party, she came to party, party
C'mon
Now she don't worry bout what people think bout her cause she fly
When everbody on the floor goes left and then she goes right
Now i think that its possible for the beat, dance it all night
All night long
She don't know how to uhhh, she dont know how to act, no x3
She goin crazy, she, she goin crazy on the floor
Floor...
she, she goin crazy on the floor
She don't know how to uhhh, she dont know how to act, no x3
She goin crazy, she, she goin crazy
