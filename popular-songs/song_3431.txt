There's a place I like to go
Where I can hear the cotton grow
When that train whistles blow
A dozen miles down the road
All I really have to do
Is just be still
There's the place I love to be
Momma, Daddy, my sister and me
First time I ever saw the beach
Back to 1983
All I really have to do
Is just be still
When this road gets crazy and tries to break me
And I've had all I can stand
I can close my eyes no matter where I am
And just be still
There's a place that I can see
Where my baby's next to me
Close enough to feel the heat
All wound up beneath the sheets
All I have to do
Is just be still
When this road gets crazy and tries to break me
And I've had all I can stand
I can close my eyes no matter where I am
And just be still
There's a place I need to go
Where the stained glass windows glow
Every part of me is known
Thank God I can go there
Thank God I can go there still
Still
Oh, thank God I can go there still
