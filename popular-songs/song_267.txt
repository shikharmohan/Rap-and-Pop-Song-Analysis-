U got me  (U got me)
See I was out buying Chanel bags
While I was doing that u turned up your swag, (u got me) 
Yup, caught me slippin, but get your hustle on, shawty I aint trippin (U got me)
I been in the game since '03
You can try, but you still can do it like me (U got me)
I hate it when they talk about me
but I love it when they talk about me (U got me)
I got a lil too prissy, 
I didn't expect yall bitches to try to get me (U got me)
But imma need that, you can go and write your blog, i dont need your feedback (U got me)
See I was on the red carpet when I shoulda been in the studio laying down hot shit (U got me)
Madder than a motherfucker, I can't lie a bitch madder than motherfucker (U got me)
I'm badder than a motherfucker, been up all night like UPS trucker (U got me)
Back up on my job, Im back up in the trap
Shawty give me dap (U got me)
Back in my falsetto, got me taking off these 5-inch stilettos (U got me)
Back up out my phantom
Im back up in the jeep, back up in the streets (U got me)
Hey, hey, Im all fired up
And tell your informant Im all wired up (U got me)
Please no pictures (U got me), up off of my twitter (U got me)
Im back up on my shit
And when I see the stage, Imma black bag that bitch 
(Next song) Imma black bag that bitch, and when i see the stage imma black bag that bitch (repeat x 3)
oh oh ohh oohh yea,
I shoulda listened to myself, before I let you in 
I shoulda warned myself, tell me again and again again, 
I shouldve cautioned myself before I fell in love with you 
but I just pushed myself, thats what lovers do (oh ohh) 
Picking up the pieces of my heart, I'm tired of lovin' you in the dark
I wish I could've seen what you had planned for me
Fancy clothes and fancy cars
will go that far but turn into misery
When you dont go
With your basic instinct (oh, oh)
with your basic instinct (oh, oh)
with your basic instinct (oh, oh)
with your basic instinct, instinct (oh, oh)
Yeah, Aw yeah (repeat 12x)
