It was rainin' hard in Houston when I ran into her
I searched for conversation but I was lost for words
Then a cloud of tear filled memories came crashin' down on me
If it hadn't been for the pourin' rain, I'm sure she would have seen
Tears in the rain, hidin' the pain
Maybe she'd come back if she could see me cry
She thinks I'm so strong, oh but she's so wrong
She just couldn't see these tears in the rain
Now I'll regret that moment 'coz I didn't let her know
How much I still loved her, I was hopin' it would show
But the raindrops and the teardrops ran together on my face
Now she'll never ever know, no one can take her place
Tears in the rain, hidin' the pain
Maybe she'd come back if she could see me cry
She thinks I'm so strong, oh but she's so wrong
She just couldn't see these tears in the rain
She thinks I'm so strong, oh but she's so wrong
She just couldn't see these tears in the rain
