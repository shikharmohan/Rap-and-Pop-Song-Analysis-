I've seen that darkness on the edge of town
The sun come up and the rain fall down
And I've been a fool, yeah, I've been around
And when the world got too much for me
I took off and left a memory
Thinking I'd find something better for me somehow, oh, but now
Whenever I run
Instead of running into the blue, I follow my heart
And there in your arms is where I find the love I need
And the best is yet to come, baby, you're the one I run to
I used to quit when it got too tough
Throw in my cards when I was down on my luck
But, baby, you mean too much to me
So now whenever I run
Instead of running into the blue, I follow my heart
And there in your arms is where I find the love I need
And the best is yet to come, baby, you're the one I run to
I never could stay in one place too long
I never could stand that still
Ah, but you've changed so much in me
And now I know I will
I'm gonna stay where the love is right
I'm so tired of being a bird in flight
Good love takes work, ah, but that's alright, that's alright
Whenever I run
Instead of running into the blue, I follow my heart
And there in your arms is where I find the love I need
And the best is yet to come, you're the only one
Instead of running into the blue, I follow my heart
And there in your arms, that's where I find the love I need
And the best is yet to come, baby, you're the one I run to
The one I run to, the one I run to, oh
