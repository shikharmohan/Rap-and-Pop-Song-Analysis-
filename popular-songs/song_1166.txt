Everybody says that when it comes to friends
The truest kind are counted on one hand
But take a look around before you hit the ground
The only one you'll see will be this man
Yeah, I'll catch you when you fall, 'cause I'm the one who loves you
You'll never wonder if I care, I'll always be there
Standin' there, losin' ground, I'm your best friend now
And I won't let you down, no
Yes, I've been a fool but I've learned what not to do
Don't take for granted those who keep their faith in you
And if you lose your way on some rainy day
Just look above and I will be the sunshine breakin' through
Yeah, I'll catch you when you fall, 'cause I'm the one who loves you
You'll never wonder if I care, I'll always be there
Standin' there, losin' ground, I'm your best friend now
And I won't let you down
And every step along the highway of your life
I'll be the man standing beside you, believe me that I will
And don't forget you came and you saved me, you saved my life
Yeah, I'll catch you when you fall, 'cause I'm the one who loves you
You'll never wonder if I care, I'll always be there
Standin' there, losin' ground, 'cause I'm your best friend now
And I won't let you, I will not let you
And I won't let you down
