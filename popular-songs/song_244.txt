C I A R A, come on
Pull up your pants, just like him
Take out the trash, just like him
Getting your cash like him, fast like him
Girl you wanna act like he did
I'm talking 'bout, security codes on everything
On vibrate so your phone don't ever ring
A foreign account
And another one he don't know about
Wish we could switch up the roles and I could be that
Tell you I love you but when you call, I never get back
Would you ask them questions like me, like 'Where you be at?'
'Cuz I'm out, four in the morning on the corner rolling doing my own thing
What if I had a thing on the side, made you cry
Would the rules change up or would they still apply
If I played you like a toy?
Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy
Can't be getting mad, but you mad, can't handle that?
Can't be getting mad, but you mad, can't handle that?
Girl go ahead and be just like him
Go run the streets just like him
Go home missin' sleep like 'em, creep like 'em
Front wit' you friends, act hard when you with them like him
Keep a straight face when you tell a lie
Always keep an air tight alibi
Keep it hid in the dark
What he don't know won't break his heart
Wish we could switch up the roles and I could be that
Tell you I love you but when you call, I never get back
Would you ask them questions like me, like 'Where you be at?'
'Cuz I'm out, four in the morning on the corner rolling doing my own thing
What if I had a thing on the side, made you cry
Would the rules change up or would they still apply
If I played you like a toy?
Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy
Can't be getting mad, but you mad, can't handle that?
Can't be getting mad, but you mad, can't handle that?
Can't be getting mad, but you mad, can't handle that?
Can't be getting mad, but you mad, can't handle that?
If I was always gone, hit the sun getting home
Told you I was with my crew when I knew it wasn't true
If I act like you, walked a mile off in your shoes
Messing with your head again, dose of your own medicine
What if I had a thing on the side, made you cry
Would the rules change up or would they still apply
If I played you like a toy?
Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy
Can't be getting mad, but you mad, can't handle that?
Can't be getting mad, but you mad, can't handle that?
Can't be getting mad, but you mad, can't handle that?
Can't be getting mad, but you mad, can't handle that?
R A go
Here's the clutch
If I paged you, would you like that?
Had friends, would you like that?
With a car, would you like that?
Hell nah, you wouldn't like that, no
What if I made you cry, would they still apply?
What if I, if I played you like a toy?
Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy
Can't handle that?
