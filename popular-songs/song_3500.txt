Stopped to have a few at five
Now you're crossing that center line for the third time
Second time like this, this week
Had a friend ask you for your keys, you said, "No I'm fine"
You sure do act like
You ain't got a thing to lose
But every car you pass
Might be the one's you take with you
You'd give your last breath to your wife
Take a bullet for your kids
Lay your life down for your country
For your Jesus, for your friends
There's a whole lot of things
You say you're living for
Well you've got to fight it somehow
Stop and turn around
'Cause this ain't nothin' to die for
So what's the harm in a little fun?
'Cause you're off to work
Before the sun everyday
And the inbox, outbox locks you in
And the money you make
Ain't worth the time you spend to make your pay
The doctor says, "Man, your numbers, they don't lie"
The graveyard's full of folks
That didn't have time to die
You'd give your last breath to your wife
Take a bullet for your kid
Lay your life down for your country
For your Jesus, for your friends
There's a whole lot of things
You say you're living for
Well you've got to fight it somehow
Stop and turn around
'Cause this ain't nothin' to die for
Straight through that guardrail
Up into that white light
You hear a sweet voice saying
Just this side of the other side
Just this side of the other side
You'd give your last breath to your wife
Take a bullet for your kids
Lay your life down for your country
For me and all your friends
There's a whole lot of things
You say you're living for
Well you've got to fight it somehow
Stop and turn around
'Cause this ain't nothin' to die for
Ain't nothin' to die for
Nothin' to die for
Ain't nothin' to die for, no
