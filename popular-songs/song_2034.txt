Okay, I woke up in heaven today
She kissed me, I floated away, away
Never felt anything so great
Alright now, I brace myself for the fights
Something must go wrong 'cause it's way to right
I'm light as a feather tonight, yeah, yeah
'Cause I can't feel the ground, someone let me down
I've never felt so high as I do now
It's too good to be true, I don't deserve you
I've never felt a love strong enough to
Stop this world from spinning
Stop this world from spinning
And I see heaven when she looks at me
In her smile is the most amazing dream
And in her eyes I fall asleep
And I hope, hope that she can see through the smoke
Of my imperfections into my soul
And my heart where she has control, she has control
'Cause I can't feel the ground, someone let me down
I've never felt so high as I do now
It's too good to be true, I don't deserve you
I've never felt a love strong enough to
Stop this world from spinning
Happiness like this can never last, can never last
Turns into the memories of the past
Turns into the memories of the past
And today is going just as fast, going just as fast
And I can't feel the ground, someone let me down
I said I've never been so high as I am now
It's too good to be true, I don't deserve you
I've never felt a love strong enough to
Stop this world from spinning
Stop this world from spinning
