Mama went to sleep one night and never woke up
Daddy cried a tear into her old coffee cup
Now all he wants to do is drink the hurt all away
But if mama was here I know what mama would say
Carry on
Carry on
What don't kill us makes us strong
Carry on
Little sister's husband ran off with her best friend
Left her and the babies all alone again
It hurts to know the hurt that she's going through
But I know that she'll do what she's gotta do
Carry on
Carry on
What don't kill us makes us strong
Carry on
Nobody ever said that life was gonna be fair
You're never gonna get nowhere by running scared
If you look down deep inside you'll find the faith to make you strong
Oh carry on
I try to walk the sunny side of the street
Don't let no shadows tangle up my feet
There ain't no troubles that we can't rise above
With a handful of faith and a heartful of love
Carry on
Carry on
What don't kill us makes us strong
Carry on
Carry on
What don't kill us makes us strong
Carry on
Carry on
Carry on
Carry on
