Ay a ay, ooh a ay, ooh yeah, ooh yeah Ciara
That's me, the dreamer
The Dream, ooh yeah, ooh, baby
Wanna say come over but I told you that it's over
How much pain can one heart take? Oh yeah, yeah
And well, I wish that you were closer so I could love over and over again
Today I may have lost my friend
Girl, you, you are my baby, well I can't just let you leave
I'm caught up in this lover's thing
It's love and that I can't deny, won't even start to lie
I'm caught up in this lover's thing, baby you
Baby ay, baby, ay, baby, ay, baby
Baby ay, baby, ay, baby, ay, baby
Baby ay, baby, ay, baby, ay, baby
Baby, ay, baby
Girl, take back your decision and paint me back in your picture
I'm calling on your phone, girl
You keep sending me straight to voice mail
Now why ain't he persistent? I'm sure by now he misses this
Calling on the phone, you won't answer my call
And you, you are my baby, I can't just let you leave
I'm caught up in this lover's thing
Yeah, it's love and that I can't deny, won't even start to lie
I'm caught up in this lover's thing, baby, baby
Baby, ay, baby, ay, baby, ay, baby
Baby, ay, baby, ay, baby, ay, baby
Baby, ay, baby, ay, baby, ay, baby
Baby, ay, baby, yeah
Oh, ay, I wonder does she know that I love her
Oh, ay, I wonder if he knows that I care
Ooh uhh, will you ever forgive me?
Ooh uhh, hello, are you there?
Boy you, you are my baby and I can't just let you leave
I'm caught up in this lover's thing
It's love and that I can't deny, won't even start to lie
I'm caught up in this lover's thing
