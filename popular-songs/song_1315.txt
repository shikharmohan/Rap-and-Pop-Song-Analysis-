Miss Independent
Miss Self-sufficient
Miss Keep-your-distance
Miss Unafraid
Miss Outta-my-way
Miss Don't-let-a-man-interfere, no
Miss On-her-own
Miss Almost-grown
Miss Never-let-a-man-help-her-off-her-throne
So, by keeping her heart protected
She'd never ever feel rejected
Little Miss Apprehensive
I said ooh, she fell in love
What is this feeling taking over?
Thinking no one could open the door
Surprise! It's time to feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye, old you, when love is true
Miss Guarded-heart
Miss Play-it-smart
Miss If-you-wanna-use-that-line-you-better-not-start, no
But she miscalculated
She didn't want to end up jaded
And this miss decided not to miss out on true love
So, by changing her misconceptions
She went in a new direction
And found inside she felt a connection
She fell in love
What is this feeling taking over?
Thinking no one could open the door
Surprise! It's time to feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye, old you, when love is true
When Miss Independent walked away
No time for love that came her way
She looked in the mirror and thought today
What happened to Miss No-longer-afraid?
It took some time for her to see
How beautiful love could truly be
No more talk of, "Why can't that be me?"
I'm so glad I finally see
What is this feeling taking over?
Thinking no one could open the door
Surprise! It's time to feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye, old you, when love is true
Miss Independent
