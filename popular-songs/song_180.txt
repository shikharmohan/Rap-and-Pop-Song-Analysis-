Well, they say your kiss is like forbidden fruit
One taste of your sweet strawberry lips and I'll be hooked on you
And they say one day just like a dog you'll own me
I say lay it on me
Yeah, I'm six foot four and tough as a man can be
I ain't scared of much, I'll buck right up, there's a fightin' side of me
And they say I'll turn to putty and you'll mold me
Well, lay it on me
You might be more than I can stand
And after all honey I'm just one man
I might wind up sad, beat down and lonely
But I'm watching the way them jeans low ride
Your belly button ring and big blue eyes
And I can hardly wait for you to hold me
Come on and lay it on me
Well, that 'born to break hearts' tattoo don't faze me
So stroll your sweet self over here and bring me to my knees
And we'll see who comes out on top, now won't we
Lay it on me
You might be more than I can stand
And after all honey I'm just one man
I might wind up sad, beat down and lonely
But I'm watching the way them jeans low ride
Your belly button ring and big blue eyes
And I can hardly wait for you to hold me
Come on and lay it on me
Well, lay down the law or lay it all on the line
Girl, I don't care as long as you lay your body next to mine
And if you're afraid of falling, darlin' don't be
Come on and lay it on me, I said lay it on me
Come on lay it on me, yeah, yeah
Oh, son
