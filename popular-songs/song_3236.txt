Judge ft Tech N9ne - Voices
Chorus x2
i hear these voices in my head
and they don't like you 
these demons fly around bed
Telling me to take your life...
Judge D:
I don't know if it's the evil in me *cha cha cha cha*
I don't know if it's the demon in me *cha cha cha cha*
I don't know if it's an angel in the night 
telling me that god said you deserve that shit take his life
death is easy id rather bring u pain
like your forehead backwards when i carve my name
This ain't a game *na na*
Just the mind of a psychopath 
cross regime catch a mutha fuckin' blood bath
We laugh last now you on the run
make peace say your prayers now your time is done
like the wrath of god with the power of the sun 
Judge D Tech N9ne enemies here we comes
Chorus x2
Tech N9ne:

lost time from tech thee n9nes flame thrower
