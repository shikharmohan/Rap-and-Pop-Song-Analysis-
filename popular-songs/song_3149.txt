Wicked, wicked now it's on
I murder your whole city
Nigga like frank nitty's hideous insidious
Niggas betta give me respect when I flex
Comin' tech flows like amphibians
From here to the Carribeans
Unexplored territories like Venus
Niggas never seen the team that seem keenest
Bury ya mind like zimas
Infrared beamers keep ya posse on my penis
Now it's on wicked in this da link a mid to west flex
The abyss to this bitch who dis this click
Bliss is hangin' that bitch by the clitoris
You get spit on shit on hit on get on the dick of this
Slick niggara but you can always call the Nina
A killer in America, amerikilla
I got skills to kill like overdosin' pills
Blood spills for million dollar bills
You can't try to peel this or feel the illness
Of a nigga that's comin' out real
I don't know why nigga you livin' a lie
And plus I despise those who try
A nigga like I this high and fly and sly
Mid west side so you just might die
Check it out
I murder these hoes, Hercules flows
My shit carries on like hepatitis
The weak bite us mean nothin' ta me
Gimme no fuckery foul like
Now I gotta cock it to rewrite it
I might just make a nigga bite dust
When I bust plus calamity villes
Can it be ill? Yes
Sanity kills a real nigga but still
I wicked like Amityville
The best
The nine
Correct
Burn
Now it's your turn
You must learn
Misery niggas the craze like 24 gang niggas on Sherm
When it's on I be heated like a hot comb
Tell these punk muthafuckas to leave me alone
When I'm in the zone you get blown away
Get the clones away, mitch bade niggas 'cause it's on today
Now it's on
Now it's on
Now it's on
Now let me smoke and choke
And let these niggas know that Lejo ain't brought no jokes
Nigga betta learn the ropes we like costra nostra
And'll fuck around and cut yo' throat
Decapitation facin' devastation nations
When they ragin' can't stop this
Nigga you can catch a fist and you can rest in piss
But the dis and you thought I missed
I'm indestructible and untouchable
Ain't givin' a fuck about what you know
I don't love no hoe, I don't mug no mo
But I'm still collectin' my other dough
Now peep the rawness my rhymes is flawless
Fools get tossed for tryin' to floss like bosses
People can call this the clique wit no losses
'Cause a nigga can flow from September to August
Deeper than seven seas, colder than no degrees
Niggas is easy to get down on ya knees
When you fuckin' wit rhymes like these
I always find that he's bitin' my shit it's me he's tryin' to be
No more chances understand this
I'm the man wit the plan I stand from Kansas
And this weed enhances scandalous dances
What is in my hands will take yo last glances
Fuckin' wit a technicality, that's what it gotta be
Nigga sittin' on the side of me
My mentality makes fatality reality
Split yo anatomy, assault and battery
Niggas pray to God we stop, we won't though
Askin' who's on the top, they don't know
But don't no muthafucka in the muthafuckin'
Western muthafuckin' hemisphere really want Joe
Associated with a deadly force we got codes
Deeper than Morse sounds like
And needle points bullet shoot through a horse
So of course I'm leavin' niggas dead like a corpse
Don't test me biatchres
Another collorialism I came up wit the bitch deep this twist
People do pitiful shit I do unforgettable hits
And niggas submitted to amerikilla did it and got
Acquitted it I flip in a minute I'ma get them relish lips
You can't sell us dip we gettin' high off K Bombay
Packin' hella heat like pompay
Itch-made abay igga-may anyway
I get ill when I feel like, gettin' biz
You know what that is? I know what that is
When I be rippin' everybody know what that is
Rewind, slemet, niet, haa, heeeh!
If anybody wanna catch this
I just said fuck demons and I got pit backwards
And that's bomb futuristic attack shit
Match this takes hella practice
To rips scripts nigga gotta be thorough
I gotta make this shit make sense
So I can say, "Made it ma", top of the world
Gimme life or give me death
Death becomes evil like asmodious
I gotta a melodious flow
It becomes podious changeable
Unnameable angel
Angelic bustin' like a magnum, tom selleck
Advisory terror sick of losin' money in harrah's
Mic assassin like Anotonio Banderas
How many niggas you know I bust style
So ambidextrous and I mean I'm buck wild
When it's on I be heated like a hot comb
Like I said in the first, zone
Accident prone but these niggas don't wanna flex
Wit tech when the heat is on nigga now it's on
Now it's on
Now it's on
Now it's on
Now it's on
Now it's on
Now it's on
Now it's on
Now it's on
Now it's on
