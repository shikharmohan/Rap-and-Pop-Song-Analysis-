Preacher man walked into the club and he said he said
"hey girl cant you walk a mile straight?"
Father im torn and im selling my soul to the
Rhythm, the beat and the bass cuz I cant
Confess my rock and roll ways
Cuz i'm so possessed with the music
The music he plays
I cant stop my feet from dancin' to the sound of his drum
Oh no I fell in love with my rock god
I cant keep my hips from swayin' to his sweet melody
You see I fell in love my rock rock god
Preacher man took my hand and looked in my eyes
He said "hey girl cant you leave?" and I cried
"father things aren't always so black and white..
Don't cast the first stone cuz i'm not alone"
And its not like i'm hurting anyone..
But I cant confess my rock .. my rock and roll ways
I cant stop my feet from dancin' to the sound of his drum
Oh no I fell in love with a rock god
I cant keep my hips from swayin' to his sweet melody
You see I fell in love my rock rock god
I cant stop my feet from dancin' to the sound of his drum
Oh no I fell in love with my rock god
I cant keep my hips from swayin' to his sweet melody
You see I fell in love my rock rock god
No I wouldn't change a thing even if I could
I chose a path and i'm not looking back
And i'm sorry if I left the angels crying
Over me...
I cant stop my feet from dancin' to the sound of his drum
Oh no I fell in love with my rock god
I cant keep my hips from swayin' to his sweet melody
You see I fell in love my rock rock god
Preacher man, preacher man... preacher man.. preacher man.. preacher man preacher man preacher man preacher man im gone.. gone..gone gone........
