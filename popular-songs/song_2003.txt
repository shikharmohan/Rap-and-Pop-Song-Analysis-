sugar cocoa brown
she stand 5 foot 3
and shes all by her self
it doesnt make no sense to me
(shes incredible)
im wantin to approach
but i take it slow
and make sure that shes not with anybody
very insecure
so now that im sure
i slide in and sit right next to this shawty
and said correct me if im wrong
arent you alone tonight?
you got it goin on
girl your everything i like
and im not tryna bother you
but girl if you dont mind
can i keep you company?
baby can i keep you company?
smilin at me now
such a pretty smile
im figurin her out
and i really dig her style
we have a couple drinks
have a couple laughs
suddenly the nights about to end
we have one more toast
then she pulls me close
then in my ear she starts whisperin
she says correct me if im wrong
arent you alone tonight
you got it goin on
your everything i like
and im not tryna bother you
but if you dont mind
can i keep you company?
baby can i keep you company
she says correct me if im wrong
arent you alone tonight
you got it goin on
your everything i like
and im not tryna bother you
but if you dont mind
can i keep you company
baby can i keep you company
