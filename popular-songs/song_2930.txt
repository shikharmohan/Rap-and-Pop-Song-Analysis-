Oh, on a park bench in the middle of July
We sat and watched the children play
If it was the heat or the noise
He didn't have too much to say
Then with a move of his eyes
A move that would have made the wind stand still
He took my hand in his and said the words
That I never will forget
He said, "Have you ever cheated on me?
Has there been someone else?
Is there someone you love more than me?
Someone you can't forget"
Get his memory in the open again
Let it be chased away by time
He said, "Have you ever cheated on me?"
I said, "Only in my mind"
How can I tell him the time we spent together
Was time between friends?
There's just somethings I can talk about with you
That I can't just talk to him
How can I tell him
That somewhere in the cards it was meant for us to meet
Why am I blushing in front of him now?
Is it you or the heat?
He said, "Have you ever cheated on me?
Has there been someone else?
Is there someone you love more than me?
Someone you can't forget"
Get his memory in the open again
Let it be chased away by time
He said, "Have you ever cheated on me?"
And I said, "Only in my mind"
"Darling, have you ever cheated on me?"
And I said, "Only in my mind"
