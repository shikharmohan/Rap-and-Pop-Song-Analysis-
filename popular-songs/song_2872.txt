Cool breeze on the river ripples to the shore
Wash away my troubles to the sea forever more
Wind and willows whisper, sadness is the sound
Tell a tale of my wants, happy world that's falling down
Old man I might be going where you're bound
Old man river, I've come to talk again
Yes, I know you're tired
'Cause your journey never ends
He's just like you, he's moving all the time
And I think he's moving me out of his mind
I want to travel with you in your deep and nimble soul
That's the only way to make it peaceful like before
We used to touch at midnight but now I feel he's gone
Even though he's lying next to me I feel alone
Oh man it looks like I'm to travel alone
Old man river, I've come to talk again
Yes, I know you're tired
'Cause your journey never ends
He's just like you, he's moving all the time
And I think he's moving me out of his mind
Old man river, I've come to talk again
Yes, I know you're tired
'Cause your journey never ends
He's just like you, he's moving all the time
And I think he's moving me out of his mind
