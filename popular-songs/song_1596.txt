Never thought we'd meet again, here expecially.
When you left, it hurt so much,
Never got to say goodbye.
[CHORUS]
Don't say you'll stay
if your gonna go again.
Can't help but think
your gonna leave me in the rain.
Every time I see
your photo I can't help but cry
cause you left without a word
and i didn't get to say goodbye
Cause you left without a word
and I didn't get to say, goodbye
I sit alone and watch the stars
but it's just not the same.
And i feel a tear roll down my cheek
every time i hear your name.
I sit alone and play your favorite song
and tears fall as i sing along
The tears are falling fast
I can't even breathe,
when I close my eyes
your all I see.
[CHORUS 2x]
Oh Oh
Didn't get to say
Didn't get to say
Goodybe!
say goodbye...
