They say Ciara got the hood...
Ciara got the 'burbs...
They say Ciara got the moves...
Ciara got them curves...
Let me put y'all up on my swag, my swag
Diva of Decatur, I got stunnas they black, they black
Up in the salon, the salon to add some tracks
Pocahontas, I got hair down my back, my back
Run that back..
Guess I just got the nack, the nack
See a cutie, push up on him, yes I'm a mack, a mack
Ain't got no suave, I can travel from trap to trap
On my J.O., ayo
When my mac talk back, 
Run that back
(Hello!)
Hello, hello
Talkin' bout that fly shit
Somethin' you can ride wit
Did you hear me?
(Hello!)
Hello, hello
Don't disturb me
I don't think you heard me
So I gotta
Echo, echo
Raise your voice, raise your voice
Girls louder than the boys
Echo, echo
Say it again, say it again
Lemme hear you make some noise
They say Ciara got the hood...
Ciara got the 'burbs...
They say Ciara got the moves...
Ciara got them curves...
Now check that bobble on my finger so right, so right
Got the windows tinted but its catchin' the light, the light
Speakers thumpin' hard to that Tupac and 50 track
They runnin' to the corner yellin' who that, who that 
(Run it back!)
On my shoe game, girl I'm a fool, a fool
Down to my Giuseppes and the rims on my Rover too
Turned 22, nothin' smaller than 22's 
Platinum on the plaque, I got two of 'em back to back
Run that back
(Hello!)
Hello, hello
Talkin' bout that fly shit
Somethin' you can ride wit
Did you hear me?
(Hello!)
Hello, hello
Don't disturb me
I don't think you heard me
So I gotta
Echo, echo
Raise your voice, raise your voice
Girls louder than the boys
Echo, echo
Say it again, say it again
Lemme hear you make some noise
They say Ciara got the hood...
Ciara got the 'burbs...
They say Ciara got the moves...
Ciara got them curves...
Turn around, turn around, 
Turn around, turn around
Let 'em see that body
Then tell 'em
Wipe me down, wipe me down, wipe me down
You lookin' good enough to hurt somebody
If he didn't hear you before,
Well I bet that he hearin' you now
I bet that he's hearing you now
He wouldn't listen before,
Well I bet that he hearin' you now
Hello!
(Hello!)
Hello, hello
Talkin' bout that fly shit
Somethin' you can ride wit
Did you hear me?
(Hello!)
Hello, hello
Don't disturb me
I don't think you heard me
So I gotta
Echo, echo
Raise your voice, raise your voice
Girls louder than the boys
Echo, echo
Say it again, say it again
Lemme hear you make some noise
Hello, hello...
Hello, hello...
Echo, echo...
Echo, echo...
Hello, hello...
Hello, hello...
(Hello!)
Hello, hello
Talkin' bout that fly shit
Somethin' you can ride wit
Did you hear me?
(Hello!)
Hello, hello
Don't disturb me
