HOVERING:
Sometimes I wonder if everything changed
How would we make out
And now suddenly thunder and everything's changed
There's this big dark cloud
Hovering, hovering, hovering, hovering
(You always said that we'd make it through)
Troubling, stumbling, fumbling for the words to say that I'm leaving you
I'm leaving you
We go through the motions like everything's settled, but it's inside out
And it makes us uncomfortable still holding on when there's all this doubt
Hovering, hovering, hovering, hovering
(You always said that we'd make it through)
Troubling, stumbling, fumbling for the words to say that I'm leaving you
I'm leaving you
And maybe were just older, just a little older
Cause the fact that this is over, the fact that this is over with you, yeah
Hovering, hovering, hovering
(You always said that we'd make it through)
Troubling, stumbling, fumbling for the words to say that I'm leaving you
Leaving you
Troubling, stumbling, fumbling for the words to say that I'm leaving you
(You always said that we'd make it through)
(You always said that we'd make it through)
