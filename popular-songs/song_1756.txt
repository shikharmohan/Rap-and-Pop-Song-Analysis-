ooh. I made the big mistake. The big mistake hat brought me to you I loved you so much. I thought i could make it through. I never really asked you. I was so clueless. Now that i had you, then lost you, i dont know what to do with this life, that is now torn apart. 
You made me think you were everything. It worked to well. I fell for you like an angel. Running from Heaven to hell. You changed just like that. I didn't think it was possible. I cried through the nights thinking of you was unstoppable. 
Its like you took my heart and purposly tore it in two. I Never knew what a person like you could do. I dreamt and prayed through the nights that someday i would win back your love. But this dream would only be if you loved me enough. 
I came to the day when i finally gave up. Getting over you was yes, just to toughhh. I can't fall out of love with you, you wouldn't understand. Cause you've moved on now.. aaaaannnnnddddd...
