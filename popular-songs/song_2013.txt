She wanted the money, fame
The brand names, fancy cars
She left a hard working man behind
For a fellow with a championship ring
Oh, but see here's the thing about dating a superstar
She was one of like eight or nine
Just another ball player's plaything
Oh, and I'm singing
What's the matter with you baby?
What's the matter with you baby?
What's the matter with you, oh you?
Said ain't that your dream come true?
What's the matter with you baby?
What's the matter with you baby?
What's the matter with you?
No one to blame but you
No one to blame but you, you yeah
He wanted the money, fame
The brand names, fancy cars
Lookin' up to the pusher man
He wanted to be like them oh so bad
Oh, one hell of a price to pay if you get caught
See that's the part he didn't understand
Now he's sittin' in a prison cell all mad
Hey, and I'm askin'
What's the matter with you fella?
What's the matter with you fella?
What's the matter with you, hey you?
Hey, said ain't that your dream come true?
What's the matter with you fella?
What's the matter with you fella?
What's the matter with you?
No one to blame but you
No one to blame but you
Hey, all the ladies like the bad boys
So you go and get a bad boy
And he treats you bad
Hey, and you act surprised
Be careful what you ask for
You got what you asked for
Tell me why you're mad?
Oh, tell me why you're mad, yeah, yeah, yeah?
We keep complaining but we won't change
But half of us don't do a thing
So everything stays the same
And I'm asking
What's the matter with you tell me?
What's the matter with you tell me?
What's the matter with you?
Hey, we can't make our dreams come true
What's the matter with you tell me?
What's the matter with you tell me?
What's the matter with you?
Hey yeah, can't make our dreams come true
What's the matter with you tell me?
What's the matter with you tell me?
What's the matter with you?
Can't make our dreams come true
What's the matter with you tell me?
What's the matter with you tell me?
What's the matter with you?
