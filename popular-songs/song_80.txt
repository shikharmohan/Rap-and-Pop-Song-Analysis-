Back in the good old days
Knew how to brawl
I'm talking real gunslingers
I'm talking real outlaws
They'd saddle up and ride on into town
When it was high noon in them old saloons
You knew what was going down
They took it outside, took it outside
It was man to man, it's toe to toe
You know they had to go
Well, nobody's gonna break it up
Not until you've had enough
And if you think you've got the guts
Then let's take it outside
Well, if you think your man enough
You really wanna knuckle up
If you wanna shed a little blood
Then let's take it outside, let's take it outside
These days things have changed
There's a lot of talk, lot of pushing and shoving
Well, if you wanna walk the walk
Well, let's have some respect
They got girls in here, just pay your tab
Lay down your beer [Incomprehensible]
And let's take it outside, let's take it outside
It's man to man, it's toe to toe
You know we need to go
Well, nobody's gonna break it up
Not until we've had enough
And if you think you've got the guts
Then let's take it outside
Well, if you think your man enough
You really wanna knuckle up
If you wanna shed a little blood
Then let's take it outside, let's take it outside, yeah
We're all here for a good time
Don't start no trouble
'Cause it won't be the first time
I put a scar on my knuckles
Now brother, I don't mind
And I'll be glad to stomp your ass
But if both of us walk out that door
One of us ain't coming back
Nobody's gonna break it up
Not until we've had enough
And if you think you've got the guts
Then let's take it outside
Well, if you think your man enough
You really wanna knuckle up
If you wanna shed a little blood
Then let's take it outside, let's take it outside, yeah
