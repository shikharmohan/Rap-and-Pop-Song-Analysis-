When I feel all alone and nobody knows
Still gotta smile for a while, I can't let it show
Dry my tears, have no fears and when I'm
(And when I'm)
Backstage feeling down and the lights come on
No time to worry, gotta hurry
Time to sing my song, gonna shake it off
(Shake it off)
Strike a pose
(Strike a pose)
Snap my fingers just like that
Don't get what I want and that's a fact
Snap my fingers just like that
Don't get what I want just 'cause I want it
I'm super cool, super hot
Livin' like a rock star
You think I'm super, you think I'm super
On the cover of your magazine
Wherever I go they make a scene
I'm super, super, I'm super-duper
So you wanna be just like
So you wanna be just like
Think you wanna be just like me
Everybody's watchin' me
Never as easy as it seems
To be super, super, to be super, supergirl
When I walk in the room everybody stops
Camera's flashin', people fighting for the best shot
They like my hair, the clothes I wear
Everybody wants to know what I'm doin' next
Sometimes I wish I could stay
And home just be by myself, I wanna be
(I wanna be)
What the world can't see can't you see?
Snap my fingers just like that
Don't get what I want and that's a fact
Snap my fingers just like that
Don't get what I want just 'cause I want it
I'm super cool, super hot
Livin' like a rock star
You think I'm super, you think I'm super
On the cover of your magazine
Wherever I go they make a scene
I'm super, super, I'm super-duper
So you wanna be just like
So you wanna be just like
Think you wanna be just like me
Everybody's watchin' me
Never as easy as it seems
To be super super, to be super, supergirl
Wish you could see I'm like everybody else
Struggling to let go and always be myself
I'm super cool, super hot, super
I'm super, super, I'm super, super
On the cover of your magazine
Wherever I go they make a scene
I'm super, super, I'm super, super
So you wanna be just like
So you wanna be just like
Think you wanna be just like me
Everybody's watchin' me
It's never as easy as it seems
To be super, super
To be super, supergirl
