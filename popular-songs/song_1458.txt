Somebody's callin', callin' my little darlin'
Darlin' tonite
This time, oh Lord, it ain't me
Instead a sittin' here bawlin' bawlin'
Oughta be a crawlin' back to make things right
Somebody's callin' my little darlin'
Darlin' tonite
Well, the clock on the wall says midnight
And my baby still ain't home
Where, oh where, can she be?
Well I get a sneakin' suspicion
She ain't all alone
What is this sound I hear a hauntin' me?
Somebody's callin', callin' my little darlin'
Darlin' tonite
This time, oh Lord, it ain't me
Instead a sittin' here bawlin' bawlin'
Oughta be a crawlin' back to make things right
Somebody's callin' my little darlin'
Darlin' tonite
Well she used to always be there
Whenever I would call
Waitin' for me patiently
Now my fingers are cut o' stone
Dialin' this ol' phone
I guess she's over gettin' over me
Somebody's callin'' callin' my little darlin'
Darlin' tonite
This time, oh Lord, it ain't me
Instead a sittin' here bawlin' bawlin'
Oughta be a crawlin' back to make things right
Somebody's callin' my little darlin'
Darlin' tonite
Instead a sittin here bawlin' bawlin'
Oughta be a crawlin' back to make things right
Somebody's callin' my little darlin'
Darlin' tonite
