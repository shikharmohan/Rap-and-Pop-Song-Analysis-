La, la, la
Ohh
It's not that serious
I never put that much thought into us
It wasn't that I loved you, I was curious
Who did you think that you were involved with?
Now baby you should know it's not that serious
How could you tell me that you love me
When I knew you were just tryin' to play me
But you're the fool
'Cause I know how to switch the game upon you
And in the end I know who will lose
I played this game before
Can't play no more
Do you take me for?
It's not what you thought
Don't play games with me
'Cause I came to teach
And if you want to cheat
It won't be with me
It's not that serious
I never put that much thought into us
It wasn't that I loved you, I was curious
Who did you think that you were involved with?
Now baby you should know, it's not that serious
It should concern you that I'm always one step ahead of you
So that should let you know that what you do
I have done before, it's nothing new
So run those games on someone who can't be fooled
I can almost see
That's gonna through your teeth
In every word you speak
You make it clear to me
That you're playin' wrong
And your game ain't strong
I've been in this too long
So just be movin' on
It's not that serious
I never put that much thought into us
It wasn't that I loved you, I was curious
Who did you think that you were involved with?
Now baby you should know, it's not that serious
I never put that much thought into us
It wasn't that I loved you, I was curious
Who did you think that you were involved with?
Now baby you should know, it's not that serious
[Foreign content]
Don't play games with my heart
I will let you go before you start
It's not that serious
I never put that much thought into us
It wasn't that I loved you, I was curious
Who did you think that you were involved with?
Now baby you should know it's not that serious
I never put that much thought into us
It wasn't that I loved you, I was curious
Who did you think that you were involved with?
Now baby you should know it's not that serious
