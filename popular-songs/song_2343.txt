I see you across the room
I had to come get at you
You want it Model Chick
Ooh, you done true
So I, stepped to the DJ quick
I told him drop that, I'm Mr Biggs
Just give me the chance
To put my hands on you
Made the DJ slow it down
So I can put my arms around you
Had to get you next to me
'Cause we about to be doing our thing
Slow dancin', bumpin' and grindin'
And maybe romancin'
So into you not, trancin'
Hands on your waist, we face to face
Slow dancin', bumpin' and grindin'
And maybe romancin'
I'm all in your ear and I'm whisperin'
Oh, I'm feelin' this 'cause we chillin' baby
Now, that I got you right here
I'm feeling you girl it's clear
You know what I mean
I'm thinking 'bout what's in them jeans
I ain't tryna let you go
Don't want it to end, oh no
Fienin for you for sure
So tell him to drop one more
Made the DJ slow it down
So I can put my arms around you
Had to get you next to me
'Cause we about to be doing our thing
Slow dancin', bumpin' and grindin'
And maybe romancin'
So into you not, trancin'
Hands on your waist, we face to face
Slow dancin', bumpin' and grindin'
And maybe romancin'
I'm all in your ear and I'm whisperin'
Oh, I'm feelin' this 'cause we chillin' baby
I want this to go on all night
Ooh, baby it feels so right
Me up on you, holding you tight, which is so nice
Baby don't you go no where
Keep it right there, keep it right there
Yeah yeah yeah
Slow dancin', bumpin' and grindin'
And maybe romancin'
So into you not, trancin'
Hands on your waist, we face to face
Slow dancin', bumpin' and grindin'
And maybe romancin'
I'm all in your ear and I'm whisperin'
Oh, I'm feelin' this 'cause we chillin' baby
Slow dancin', bumpin' and grindin'
And maybe romancin'
So into you not, trancin'
Hands on your waist, we face to face
This is my song for real no doubt
And the DJ making me feel thugged out
And I walked onto the dance floor
Baby get your dance on
Put your arms around me
'Cause I'm chillin' on your booty
