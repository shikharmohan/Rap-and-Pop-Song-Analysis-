When I looked over my shoulder
It got a little bit colder
It's like I lost love from an angel
And now I'm feelin' like a stranger
Abandoned, I'm stranded
I gotta get back to you
I called AAA, they said they on the way
Times tickin' fast, gotta see you today
But if my time is up
Let me know right now
I will find a way
To your heart again
So I'm speedin'
I'm speedin', whoa
Speedin'
I'm speedin'
Alright, no time to be patient
Just got the confirmation
And now I'm flyin' down the highway
She's cryin', tryin' to love my way
I'm with it, so with it
Committed to ride away with you girl
And give you what you need
More than your eyes could ever see
But if my time is up
Let me know right now
I will find a way
To your heart again
So I'm speedin'
I'm speedin', whoa
Speedin'
I'm speedin'
Time's movin' fast but not fast enough
So we're speedin', speedin'
I'm racin' fast but not fast enough
So I'm speedin', speedin'
I'm doin' 90 down the highway
Gotta make this turn, I'll be there right away, baby
Hop out the car, I'm at your door, open it up and there you go
I gotta scoop you in my arms
But if my time is up
Let me know right now
I will find a way
To your heart again
So I'm speedin'
I'm speedin', whoa
Speedin'
I'm speedin'
Speedin', I'm speedin'
Oh, speedin', I'm speedin'
Speedin', I'm speedin'
Speedin'
