Amy's got the letters I wrote
My picture in a frame
She's had a year to let go
She's still wearing my ring
It hasn't left her finger
Since the night that I proposed
When I promised her forever
Before I took her home
But I never made it home that night
A part of her died too
I watched her losing her mind
And there's nothing I can do, oh
Sometimes she goes crazy
Screaming out my name
Saying, "Baby, please come and save me"
I wish she knew I'd do anything
To kiss the tears right off her face
Tell her everything's okay
Feel her heartbeat next to mine
And make up for lost time
Oh, but God, I know I can't
You can't let her live this way
It's too late for saving me
But there's still hope for saving Amy
Now 3 years have gone by
She's trying to live her life
And I still watch her sometimes
Just to make sure she's alright
She knows I'll always be there
In her heart and in her dreams
'Cause God, I promised her forever
And that's one promise I intend to keep
To kiss the tears right off her face
Tell her everything's okay
Feel her heartbeat next to mine
And make up for lost time
Oh, but God, I know I can't
But you can't let her live this way
It's too late for saving me
But there's still hope for saving Amy
I'll kiss the tears right off her face
When I walk her through these gates
Feel her heartbeat next to mine
Make up for lost time
God, I thank you everyday
For giving a her that ounce of faith
That led her right back here to me
And most of all for saving Amy
Saving Amy
Thank you, God, for saving Amy
For saving Amy
Thank you, God, for saving Amy
For saving Amy, yeah
For saving Amy, for saving Amy
Saving Amy
Thank you, God, for saving Amy
