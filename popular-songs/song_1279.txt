I gotta tell you, I am so happy
To get to sing with you tonight
But the song we're gonna sing
You stole my man, okay
And I'm not happy about that
Alright she did, oh well
I've known about you for a while now
When he leaves me, he wears a smile
Now as soon as he's away from me
In your arms is where he wants to be
But you're the one he rushes home to
You're the one he gave his name to
I've never seen his face in the early morning light
You have his mornings, his daytimes
And sometimes I have his nights
But does he love you? Does he love you?
Like he loves me? Like he loves me?
Does he think of you? Does he think of you?
When he's holding me?
Does he whisper, does he whisper?
All his fantasies
Does he love you? Does he love you?
Like hes been loving me?
But when he's with me
He says he needs me
And that he wants me
That he believes in me
And when I'm in his arms
How he swears there's no one else
Is he deceiving me?
Or am I deceiving myself?
Am I deceiving myself?
Does he love you? Does he love you?
Like he loves me? Like he loves me?
Does he think of you? Does he think of you?
When hes holding me?
Does he whisper? Does he whisper?
All his fantasies?
Does he love you? Does he love you?
Like he's been loving me
Ooh, shouldn't I lose my temper?
Ooh, shouldn't I be ashamed?
'Cos I have everything to lose
I have nothing to gain
Does he love you? Does he love you?
Like he loves me? Like he loves me?
Does he think of you? Does he think of you?
When he's holding me?
Does he whisper? Does he whisper?
All his fantasies?
Does he love you? Does he love you?
Like hes been loving me
Ooh, does he love you?
