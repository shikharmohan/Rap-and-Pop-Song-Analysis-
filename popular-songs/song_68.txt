That backward town in my rearview
Was gonna be my whole world
Till my factory job got shipped to Mexico
And a city boy stole my sweet girl
I used to know everybody by name
Everybody's moved away
Can't say that I'm really wantin' to go
But I've run out of reasons to stay
This ain't nothin' like what I
Had in mind for me
But then again my future
Ain't what it used to be
Well I thought like my dad and his daddy before
That I would die where I was born
Live a small town dream in a big backyard
Raisin' babies and corn
Now here I am, one eye on the road
Tryin' to read a map on the dash
Nowhere close to making up my mind
With a fork in the road comin' fast
This ain't nothing like what I
Had in mind for me
Then again my future
Ain't what it used to be
This ain't nothing like what I
Had in mind for me
Then again my future
Ain't what it used to be
That backward town in my rearview
Was gonna be my whole world
