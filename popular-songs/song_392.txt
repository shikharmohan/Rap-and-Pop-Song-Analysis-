(Jason Carter / Scott Boyd / Dierks Bentley)
It's dark outside my window and cold without you near
I keep thinkin back on the times when you were mine
But rings and dreams don't matter cause I know you're with him tonight
And you've already left without a fight
Chorus
What can I do to make you believe my love is true
What can I say to keep you from walkin away
How can I make my heart believe we're really through
When it's not through loving you
The dawn will bring a new day and I suppose the sun will shine
But it won't bring back the light in my life
Cause I'm afraid I've waited too long to tell you how I feel
It's sad to think I lost you cause I couldn't lose my pride
Chorus
How can I make my heart believe we're really through
When it's not through loving you
