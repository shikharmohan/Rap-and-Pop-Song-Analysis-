She locked her fingers and bowed her head
She said, "I'm late and I'm really scared"
Now you can go but I hope you stay
I'm gonna keep it either way
In my daddy's El Camino
In her driveway in the rain
Starin' through that windshield
I could see my future change
And my heart hit like a hammer
And my thoughts were runnin' wild
Any fool can make a baby
But it takes a man to raise a child
I laid my head down on the wheel
She said, "I know, I know it don't seem real"
She closed her eyes but the tears flowed through
She said, "Don't hate me for lovin' you"
In my daddy's El Camino
In her driveway in the rain
Starin' through that windshield
I could see my future change
And my heart hit like a hammer
And my thoughts were runnin' wild
Any fool can make a baby
But it takes a man to raise a child
Oh, I could not reassure her
I couldn't say what I had planed
Couldn't put three words together
So I just took her hand
In my daddy's El Camino
In her driveway in the rain
Starin' through that windshield
I could see my future change
And my heart hit like a hammer
And my thoughts were runnin' wild
Any fool can make a baby
But it takes a man to raise a child
