The world is cold but I don't care
When you have flowers in your hair
I see color and I hear sound
And good things happen when you're around
I work hard for not much pay
So I can know you'll be okay
'Cause I need to live where love abounds
And good things happen when you're around
So won't you wait for me?
I'll be home soon
Wait for me
I'll only be a day or two
Won't you wait for me?
I'll be home soon
Yeah, wait for me
I'll only be a day or two
The world is cold but I don't care
When you have flowers in your hair
I see color and I hear sound
And good things happen when you're around
Good things happen when you're around
