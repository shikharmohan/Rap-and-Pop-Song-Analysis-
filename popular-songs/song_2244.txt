You really like my limousineYou like the way the wheels rollYou like my seven inch leather heelsAnd goin' to all of the shows
But...Do you love me?Really love me?Do you love me?
You like the credit cards and private planesMoney can really take you farYou like the hotels and fancy clothesAnd the sound of electric guitars
You really like rock 'n' rollAll of the fame and the masqueradeYou like the concerts and studiosAnd all the moeny honey that I make
Your backstage pass and black sunglassesMake you look just like a queenEven the fans they know your face>From all of the magazines
