[Talking:] 
we gon' make 'em slither dance to this one Zilla 
[Verse 1:] 
errybody jus (throw your hands up what) 
all the ladies jus (throw your legs up what) 
all the fellas just (throw your cups us what) 
and toast to the homeboys that soften your girls guts what 
say man she said she broke up with you last week 
now you trippin 'cause your chicken went out and passed cheeks 
and got a fast leak from Tecca Nina Katrina 
nows she right up in mi cocino while your ass sleeps 
how'd I take her from you? oh its ?? 
it's because your girly girly know I earn somethin 
now I got them legs over my shoulders 
holdin my soldier swollen I cant hold my composure 
and when I come to town, your woman come around 
and plenny fun is found when i give her some of the clown 
the Kansas City style got her yellin "jus gimme now" 
you dont wanna do the sound 'cause i'm doin bout 20 rounds 
[Chorus x2:] 
If your girls at a Tech show (it's what you thinkin) 
feel like she let go (it's what you thinkin) 
you never get no [x3] (it's what you thinkin) 
[Verse 2:] 
she know you barely make it, we got crazy cash 
on the movie set me and my homie Baby Bash 
got your girl waitin to get her world shakin 
at the Grand American givin your girl spankins 
'cause she's a bad gal she said she need a release 
so she greated with beats now she's no longer sad now 
I'm with your wifey 
'cause she say I make her feel wanted and by the way she never met nobody like me 
at the Graft and laugh makin her stare at things 
cutty Cal Grese Chris ?? 
got your hottie naughty when she drinkin them Cara B's 
at Kidd Rocks and I'm off in a booth with Tara Read 
Tecca Nina is not a coward, I'll jump in the shower 
and bumpity bumb that rock girl if you doubt her 
ask freaky Adina Howard about her 
she know we scorpios lovin to hit it for hours 
[Chorus x2:] 
If your girls at a Tech show (it's what you thinkin) 
feel like she let go (it's what you thinkin) 
you never get no [x3] (it's what you thinkin) 
[Verse 3:] 
I see you mad at me, but my nads happy 
'cause you loosin and now you wanna take a stab at me 
she hangin wit me 'cause you foul nigga 
and I'm at the 4 seasons takin her to eat Tao nigga 
thats T.A.O when I see a hoe 
she's hooked when I let the instant replay go 
she's bear now everyone's there throwin wood at it

come with us wemon its so fun with us under the sun with us 
from dawn til dusk imma give her the love that make her wanna say hummdawala 
praisin this craziness in Vegas when I get up on the stage it's outragous 
Mandaly Bay with the ?? everybody gets laid to this 
I appologize if your heart broken 
keep a spark smokin once the Ninna starts scopin 
she'll lie to you and wont blink 
when it come to Tecca Ninna bein wit your lady dont think 
[Chorus X2:] 
If your girls at a Tech show (it's what you thinkin) 
feel like she let go (it's what you thinkin) 
you never get no [x3] (it's what you thinkin) 
[Talking:]
