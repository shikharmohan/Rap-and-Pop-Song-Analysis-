Sometimes this road, it just keeps winding
Round and round and back again
But you've always kept me smiling
Over every hill, round every bend
Baby you're the one smiling with me
When the sun comes up
I got the wheel
You got the map and that's enough
And we go rollin' down this highway
Chasin' all our crazy dreams
I've gone your way and you've gone my way
Everywhere in between
One of these days
We'll find a piece of ground
Just outside of some sleepy little town
And set this circus down
Sometimes I lie awake just thinking
Of all the horizons we have seen
And as another day is sinking
I thank God, you're here with me
'Cause baby you're the one laughin' with me
When the sun goes down
Livin' on faith and holdin' on tight
To the love we found
And we go rollin' down this highway
Chasin' all our crazy dreams
I've gone your way and you've gone my way
And everywhere in between
One of these days
We'll find a piece of ground
Just outside of some sleepy little town
And set this circus down
And set this circus down
Maybe one of these days
Gonna set this circus down
Set this circus down
Maybe one of these days
Set this circus down
