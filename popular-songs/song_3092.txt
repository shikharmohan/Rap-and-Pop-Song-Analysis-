I feel like I'm walking in the sky
        (Whoa. Whoa.)
Yesterday, tears were in my eyes 
     (Whoa. Whoa.)(Oh)
With a bad day, yeah I've been there before
But I keep my head up so I don't have those anymore
I made a choice to be the best that I could ever be
Gotta stay positive, ignore the negativity
[Chorus]
I'm gonna follow my intuition
Telling myself to listen
Everything's gonna be okay
(It's gonna be a good day) (Ohhhhh..)
It's gonna be a good day
Follow my Intuition
It's gonna be good day
I gotta go with what feels right (Whoa....Whoa)
Don't always need a reason why (Whoa...Whoa)
What's the problem ?
Compare to the weight of the world
We're trying to please every man, women, boy, and girl
Better pick up the pace
There ain't no time to waste
Tomorrow's never promise so I started living for today
[Chorus]
I don't know ways that I just gotta let go
Yell it come back it's always easy to know
Sometimes it just gets so confusing
Feel like I don't know what I'm doing
(But I trusted my heart and in in it)
Turns out to be better than when it begins
You see what's meant to be it's gonna happen
"You know it's gonna be a good day"
Gonna follow my intuition
"I said it's gonna be a good day"
Everything's gonna be okay
"It's gonna be a good day (Whoa. Whoa.)
Gonna follow my intuition
"It's gonna be good day" (Oh..Whoa)
