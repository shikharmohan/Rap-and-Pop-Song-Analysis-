Afraid to grade
Wouldn't it be fun?
Cross says floss
Wouldn't it be fun?
Wet your bed
Wouldn't it be fun?
Sun felt numb
Wouldn't it be fun?
"Your eyes," the teacher said
"Your eyes," the teacher said
"Your eyes," the teacher said
The preacher said
"Don't have nothin' for you"
"Don't have nothin' for you"
"Don't have nothin' for you"
"Don't have nothin' for you"
"Don't have nothin' for you"
"Don't have nothin' for you"
"Don't have nothin' for you"
Spell the smell
Wouldn't it be fun?
Search for church
Wouldn't it be fun?
You wet your bed
Wouldn't it be fun?
Cold in coals
Wouldn't it be fun?
"Your eyes," the teacher said
"Your eyes," the teacher said
"Your eyes," the preacher said
The preacher said
"Don't have nothin' for you"
"Don't have nothin' for you"
"Don't have nothin' for you"
"Don't have nothin' for you"
"Don't have nothin' for you"
"Don't have nothin' for you"
"Don't have nothin' for you"
"Don't have nothin' for you"
"Don't have nothin' for you"
"Don't have nothin' for you"
"Don't have nothin' for you"
"Don't have nothin' for you"
"Don't have nothin' for you"
"Don't have nothin' for you"
"Don't have nothin' for you"
"Don't have nothin' for you"
