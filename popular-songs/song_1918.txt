oh oh oh ooo wow
oh oh oh 
said its 7 ? your resume it wasnt clear enough
experience is what you lack
you havent worked enough
irrelevant to the position give it a hand (oh wow oh oh)
you're a part time should have been a full time man
hook
now you're coming running back 
when your position is filled
he picked up right where you left 
thats a job and thats a fact
always puts from 9 to 5
double shift in overtime
but u showed up late to work too many times
lyrics
you gotta put in work to show me that you love me
get down and hit the dirt
the job is worth the salary
you gotta put in work
follow directions make it work
you got your feelings hurt
cause you couldnt put it work
nooo
you gotta put in work to show me that you love me
get down and hit the dirt
the job is worth the salary
you gotta put in work
follow directions make it work
you got your feelings hurt
cause you couldnt put it work
noo
you're the typical temporary never finished plan
type of guy that i need, completes all my demands
you got fired he got hired he works hard you're always tired
i think its best that you leave no longer my employee
hook
now you're coming running back 
when your position is filled
he picked up right where you left 
thats a job and thats a fact
always put from 9 to 5
double shift in overtime
but u showed up late to work too many times
chorus
you gotta put in work to show me that you love me
get down and hit the dirt
the job is worth the salary
you gotta put in work
follow directions make it work
you got your feelings hurt
cause you couldnt put it work
nooo
you gotta put in work to show me that you love me
get down and hit the dirt
the job is worth the salary
you gotta put in work
follow directions make it work
you got your feelings hurt
cause you couldnt put it work
nooo
i admit it a couple times
i never was on your mind
so now its time to hit the rooooad
its over so finally
replace you with someone who be
promoting two positions of loving and kissing me
chorus
chorus
you gotta put in work to show me that you love me
get down and hit the dirt
the job is worth the salary
you gotta put in work
follow directions make it work
you got your feelings hurt
cause you couldnt put it work
nooo
you gotta put in work to show me that you love me
get down and hit the dirt
the job is worth the salary
you gotta put in work
follow directions make it work
you got your feelings hurt
cause you couldnt put it work
no
oh oh oh oo wow
