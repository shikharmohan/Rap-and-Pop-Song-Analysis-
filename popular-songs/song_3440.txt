She wasn't real pretty
and she wasn't all that smart
but she had a smile
that was like a work of art
everybody seemed to love her,
but she let nobody in
oh lord the way i think about her
that should be a sin
when i finally got her alone one night
she confessed her every thought
said no one likes the girl she is
but you better bet I disagreed 
i said:
you might be surprised about the way i think about you
yeah you might not know that i dream of you each night
i know its alot, yeah its something out of nowhere
but its here, and its true, and as much as i love you
you might be surprised
well she could only smile back
her cheeks a rosy red
that brave young boy that i once was
was in over his head
she looked at me,
i almost died, 
that perfect twinkle in her eyes
and then she said
you might be surprised about the way i think about you
yeah you might not know that i dream of you each night
i know its alot, yeah its something out of nowhere
but its here, and its true, and as much as i love you
you might be surprised
well i can't say i've talked to her much since that night
and i dont think that she thinks of me all that much 
but i will always remember when
she told me
you might be surprised about the way i think about you
yeah you might not know that i dream of you each night
i know its alot, yeah its something out of nowhere
but its here, and its true, and as much as i love you
you might be surprised
and i couldn't help but think
"Lord, I was surprised..."
yeah, yeah yeah, I was surprised..
