How can one fall, all the time and climb again?
How does one heart feel so lost, to find again?
How can one road, lead, the way today?
Before, givin it all...
I wish I could fly to the top of the mountains,
so that I could see just how far this will go.
Feels like I'm stuck in the battle, be quick with no arma
but still standing strong cuz to be a survivor y'all gotta 
know how, y'all better know how to keep holdin' on.
How does one give all they got, (trust) receive the half?
How does one live day to day (day), forget the past?
I'm all here on my own,(if so) Imma do this all alone.
I can never live and be afraid, yeah...
I wish I could fly to the top of the mountains,

Against the wind, I'm not givin' in, I once spoke to 
a prophet he said don't stop til' you got it (ooooh)
I'm not feeling fooled, I'm not letting go (no), 
they trynna break me down but I'm not fraction (no) for all we know,
this rock keep roll, would it just be the translation to unstopable,
before the world recall those in, I wish I had win, to pretend and then..
Then maybe I could... 
Flyyy to the top of the mountains, so that I could see
just how far this will goo...
