Thought I died and gone to heaven
When I first saw her there
Standin' there in a sweat stained stetson
With her cow at the County Fair
I thought I knew how to make a move
But I can't make her mine
I wish I could forget her
But there's just somethin' in her smile
'Cuz she chews tobacco
Rides on her tractor, drives all the cowboys wild
She's a tall drink of water, a real farmers daughter
For her love I'd walk a country mile
But I can't get within spittin' distance
No matter how I beg or plead my heart's a crackin'
She chews tobacco but she won't choose me
Well her momma said, "She liked old westerns"
So I did my best John Wayne
Said, I bet we'd go together
Like grits on a gravy train
When I leaned in she gave a little grin
And puckered up her lips
And hit right where she was aimin'
Now there's a little brown stain on my blue tag
'Cuz she chews tobacco
Rides on her tractor, drives all the cowboys wild
She's a tall drink of water, a real farmers daughter
For her love I'd walk a country mile
But I can't get within spittin' distance
No matter how I beg or plead my heart's a crackin'
She chews tobacco but she won't choose me
I know it's wrong but I can't resist
Thinkin' 'bout the taste of that first kiss
'Cuz she chews tobacco
Rides on her tractor, drives all the cowboys wild
She's a tall drink of water, a real farmers daughter
For her love I'd walk a country mile
But I can't get within spittin' distance
No matter how I beg or plead my heart's a crackin'
She chews tobacco but she won't choose me
My heart's a crackin', she chews tobacco but she won't choose me
