I can feel the darkness reaching in
As I touch the place you may as well have never been
Love can hurt much more than one can bear
When a heart beats for someone who's not there
How many times must I tell myself that you're gone?
When will the rest of me wake up and see what went wrong, so wrong?
And turn on the light and pick up the phone and just call
And lay pride aside, if I had any sense left at all
Voices call that only I can hear
Who would have thought love was something I would fear
Almost home, almost there, almost taste
On my mind, in my heart, on my face
How many times must I tell myself that you're gone?
When will the rest of me wake up and see what went wrong, so wrong?
And turn on the light and pick up the phone and just call
And lay pride aside, if I had any sense left at all
Oh, just lay pride aside, if I had any sense left at all
