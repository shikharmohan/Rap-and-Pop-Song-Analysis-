Everybody needs inspiration
Everybody needs a song
Beautiful melody, when the nights so long
Cause there is no guarantee
That this life is easy (Yeah)
When my world is falling apart,
when there is no light to break up the dark
That's when I (I, I) look at you
When the waves are flooding the shore and I
can't find my way home anymore
That's when I (I, I) look at you
When I look at you
I see forgiveness, I see the truth
You love me for who I am like the stars
hold the moon
Right there where they belong and I know
I'm not alone (Yeah)
When my world is falling apart,
when there is no light to break up the dark
That's when I (I, I) look at you
When the waves are flooding the shore and I
can't find my way home anymore
That's when I (I, I) look at you
When the waves are flooding the shore and I
can't find my way home anymore
That's when I (I, I) look at you
You appear just like a dream to me
Just like kaleidoscope colors that cover me
All I need every breath that I breathe
Don't you know you're beautiful (Yeah, Yeah)
When the waves are flooding the shore and I
can't find my way home anymore
That's when I (I) look at you
You appear just like a dream to me.
