Bonified billy badass with a brown bandana
Been gone on Bicardi, bulu, but I'm bout to be bigger bit
Better break if you bust up before I'm blowed n biligerent
Six Douce spreads big in it, I'm bloated n blimpy
Broads be blowin me in the back of the black Bently

But I been in Bay with Big Von, like sha-boob-a-la-boopy/
