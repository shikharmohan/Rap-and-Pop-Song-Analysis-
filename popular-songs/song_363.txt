Girl I've been waitin on this long hard day to get over
So i can rest my head right here on your shoulder
I just wanna lay here and feel you breathe
Listen to the rhythm of your heartbeat
And see where it leads...
We're wide awake but girl I wanna make you close your eyes
And say my name like only you can say it and hold me tight
All I need is only you and me alone tonight
I wanna make you close your eyes...oh yeah...
You can make me work for it girl if you want to
Just leave a trail for me to follow you into the bedroom
And if you need a little bit of help from me
Babe there's not a button that I cant reach
Lets see where it leads
We're wide awake but girl I wanna make you close your eyes
And say my name like only you can say it and hold me tight
All I need is only you and me alone tonight
I wanna make you close your eyes
I wanna take you somewhere...out there...
'Til the world fades out of sight
We're wide awake but girl I wanna make you close your eyes
And say my name like only you can say it and hold me tight... just hold me tight
All I need is only you and me alone tonight
Yeah.. I wanna make you close your eyes...oh
I wanna make you close your eyes...oh
Girl... I wanna make you close your eyes
