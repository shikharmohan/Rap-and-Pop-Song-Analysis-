Now you been holding me down
For such a long time now
From back then till now in my story
Straight from the hood
You've always been there for me
And you had my back when they
Back when everybody said I wasn't anything
It was you who kept me holding on
No matter what was going on
So whatever you need I got you yaa
Reminiscing that 6 train from way back
Now it's sky blue phantoms and stretch may backs
For sweepin' them floors in them Bronx apartments
Mira esta que ta on the red carpet
When pun died you was the first to call me
I never told you but you was there for me
Whatever you need, I be there for you
Crack, I got ya back, for real true story
Now my loyalty will always be
With you if you just promise me
That you'll stay real just like you are
'Cuz baby you don't have to change no
You don't know how much you mean to me
Whenever you're down you know that you can lean on me
No matter the situation, boy I'm gon' hold you down
You don't know how much you mean to me
Whenever you're down you know that you can lean on me
No matter the situation, girl I'm gon' hold you down
Yo, 2005, Rakim and Jody Watley
Watch me paint a picture so perfect quite possibly
The realest frechest from BX to south beach

So remember this whenever I call
We go back too far, we been through it all
Even though we haven't spoken so long
Ain't nothing change, not a damn thing baby

Get between me and L-Lo, I simply stay
You better off sweepin' leaves on a windy day
So I don't care about the situation

'Cuz every time you had my back and all
When we were young, now you're Joey crack and all
