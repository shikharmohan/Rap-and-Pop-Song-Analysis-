We can make it better
We can make it better
We can make it better
We can make it
Somebody told me Delta's brown skin
Aka is light skin
It ain't supposed to be rough
So they got white friends
First day of school
I'm a take you sight seein'
Show you what we do
"Weekends for excitement", she said
I know what you 'bout to say like a [unverified] man
That nigga here now she only [unverified] white man
And if a nigga even wave at her, it's frightenin'
The knife fall over Brook land
When they murder for change
Prefer to remain faithful
