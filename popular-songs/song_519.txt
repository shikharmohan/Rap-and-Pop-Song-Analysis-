(Chorus)
Damnit I'm proud to buy my own bag of weed
I found me a hoe to help plant my seed
I got bail money they fuck with me
(Cause in my hood err nigga gotta eat) x5
(Verse 1)
I know where I come from
Niggas gotta grub
Penny bitchin for paper till you poppin big bucks
Give it a blow they cock it ain't no telling with them thugs
Dealers straight out da projects only felon that'll bust
Some shit you don't discuss
Snitches they get them stubs
Damnit I'm proud to buy my own bag to fill my dutch
Planted my own seed now a month without bud
Granted I got the feature we don't pump the same blood
You need that new Mercades
Hummer tha color gravy
How the hell you gon play me
I made a deal to 380
Tell me I'm acting shady
I try to ignore the lazy
Say my grace on the daily
If mine arrest me I'm ready
(Chorus)
(Verse 2)
Gotta have that dinner platter meals on deck
Cash coming that currency to earn that respect
Money machines measuring making sure you collect
Rolling that dice game you better be stomping best
Keep it moving like chess
Look for ya new address
Proof of ghetto for sex
That make the culprits go wreck
Hope the fay of the fruits of ya label mama impress
Don't know whoever knew you supported you through the stress
That drama on the block
All them run-ins with cops
Couldn't afford shoes was happy 2 pair of socks
Steady paying ya dues that landed you in the box
Other niggas confused you asked them to borrow guap.
(Chorus)
(Verse 3)
Crying erryday ben franks on they brain
Preparly marinate a million strong keep the change
Challenge that generate we gotta tone it with a crane
Hustlas for that bank be aware that we untamed
Duckets we deranged
Muscle the day I change
Melica off in that hood come get you that's point blank
Hit you it's all good
Hit dis before a game
Women tell us hes never survivin that chedar lane
You see we want it all
Yea we breakin the law
Buy it Sell it Cook it that's a merry thang if it's raw
Anyway you put it tell the folks we breakin the law
Seen it so I took it and if you tell a nigga that's all
