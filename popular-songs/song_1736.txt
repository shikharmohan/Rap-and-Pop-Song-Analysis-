You walk away from me tonight
Not knowing the real me
'Cause you believe in all the hype
I just stepped out of a magazine
Take away the glamor, the world, let it show
And forget everything you know
Take away the mirrors, the limos, the lights
'Cause I don't wanna dress up tonight
I'm gonna put on my old blue jeans
I'm gonna walk outta here into the street
Would you put up resistance?
Would it make a difference?
Would you know the real me?
Me and my old blue jeans
You think I'm unapproachable
Bet I don't feel enough
She'll read a book cover to cover
And not be so quick to judge
Take away the glamor, the makeup, the clothes
And forget everything you know
Take away the ego, the trick of the lights
'Cause I don't wanna dress up tonight
I'm gonna put on my old blue jeans
Gonna walk outta here into the street
Would you put up resistance?
Would it make a difference?
Would you know the real me?
Me and my old blue jeans
I'm gonna put on my old blue jeans
Gonna walk outta here into the street
Would you put up resistance?
Would it make a difference?
Would you know the real me?
Me and my old blue jeans
I wanna show you what you get!
I'm gonna put on my old blue jeans
Gonna walk outta here into the street
Would you put up resistance?
Would it make a difference?
Would you know the real me?
Me and my old blue jeans
I'm gonna put on my old blue jeans
Gonna walk out of here into the street
Would you put up resistance?
Would it make a difference?
Would you know the real me?
Me and my old blue jeans
I'm gonna put on my old blue jeans
Gonna walk outta here into the street
Would you put up resistance?
Would it make a difference?
Would you know the real me?
Me and my old blue jeans
