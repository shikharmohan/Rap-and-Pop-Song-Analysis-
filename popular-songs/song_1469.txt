If it weren't for kids have you ever thought
There wouldn't be no Santa Clause
Look what the store just brought
Thank God for kids
And we'd all live in a quiet house
Without big bird or a Mickey Mouse
And cool-aid on the couch
Thank God for kids
Thank God for kids there's magic for a while
A special kind of sunshine in a smile
Do you ever stop to think or wonder why?
The nearest thing to heaven is a child
Daddy how does this thing fly?
And a hundred other where's and why's
You really don't know but you try
Thank God for kids
When you look down in those trustin' eyes
That look to you, you realize
It's love that you can't buy
Thank God for kids
Thank God for kids there's magic for a while
A special kind of sunshine in a smile
Do you ever stop to think or wonder why?
The nearest thing to heaven is a child
And when you get down on your knees tonight
To thank the Lord for his guiding light
And pray they turn out right
Thank God for kids
Thank God for kids
