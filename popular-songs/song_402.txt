(Dierks Bentley)
I wake up every morning lonesome out of my mind
Reach across my bed what do I find
Sometimes a pillow sometimes a warm body
But they both leave me cold and feeling so empty
Chorus
I need to find the right one right away
I can't keep goin on livin this way
Each night I go out I'm just diggin deeper in my grave
I wonder if I'm ever gonna find
The one that'll bring me piece of mind
The one on who I can set my heart free
This livin single is gonna be the death of me
When the sun is high that's when I reach my low
And I vow to change my life and the places I go
But the sun starts sinkin and so do my big plans
And it ain't too long before a cold one's in my hand
Chorus
Now if I die before I find her
Play her this song as a reminder
Of what might have been if we had met
Before I met this timely death
Chorus
I couldn't find the right one right away
I couldn't keep goin on livin this way
Each night I went out I was just diggin deeper in my grave
I wondered if I was ever gonna find
The one that'd bring me piece of mind
The one on who I could set my heart free
This livin single it's been the death of me
This livin single it's been the death of me
