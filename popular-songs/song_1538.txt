We got the horses moving
We got woofers grooving
We got the Waylon wailing
Everybody's head is bobbing
I got the muffler flowing
I got my horn a blowing
I got the rubber burning
Down on all fours
Pull in the club
We hear the band bang
Roll through the door
Everybody hey, hey
Four on the floor, feel the beat in your soul
Moving to the rhythm, pumping till you can't take no more
Dance if you want to, do what you came to
You can't ignore the feeling of that four on the floor
Aw yeah, D.J. is really wigging
He got the old school mixing
The fellas heads are spinning
All the girls are finger licking
We got the bubbly bubbling
I got her shoulders rubbing
I got my game a spitting
Kicking it in low
She grabs my arm
Pulls me to the main stage
Out on the floor
Everybody sing, sing
Four on the floor, feel the beat in your soul
Moving to the rhythm, pumping till you can't take no more
Dance if you want to, do what you came to
You can't ignore the feeling of that four on the floor
Take a little walk outside
Honey wants to see my ride
You know I think I might
Turn on a little Barry White
Four on the floor, feel the beat in your soul
Moving to the rhythm, pumping till you can't take no more
Dance if you want to, do what you came to
You can't ignore the feeling of that four on the
Feeling of that four on the floor
Feeling of that four on the floor, oh yeah
