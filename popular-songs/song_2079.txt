[Verse 1]
We may struggle
We may even very well see hell from the gates
Don't think that you are alright
Are above making mistakes
Said I'm gonna get on your damn nerves
And you're gonna make me mad
But I believe we can survive all that
Cuz this love is good could never be that bad
[Chorus]
So may you never know the way
Way that it feels
Feels to be lonely
May you never know one day
When love isn't real
See this stuff to me is genuine only
[Verse 2]
Maybe in a perfect world
We would get along perfectly
But seeing how this is real life
Sometimes we just wanna be
And I may make you say you wanna leave
Never come back
But I don't 
But I believe we can survive all that
Cuz this love is good could never be that bad
[Chorus]
So may you never know the way
Way that it feels
Feels to be lonely
May you never know one day
When love isn't real
See this stuff to me is genuine only
[Verse 3]
Said I ain't always gonna like you girl
Said you ain't always gonna like me girl
But you're the only one I want in this world
Let me sing it again
Said I ain't always gonna like you girl
Said you ain't always gonna like me girl
But I love you more than anything in this world
[Chorus x2]
So may you never know the way
Way that it feels
Feels to be lonely
May you never know one day
When love isn't real
See this stuff to me is genuine only
So may you never know the way
Way that it feels
Feels to be lonely
May you never know one day
When love isn't real
See this stuff to me is genuine only
