Why does she need him for a father?
Not only maidens can occupy my shack
Gluing my manhood towards a manhole
Like Pepe Le Pew would say, hey, hey, hey, we clash!
I got my diddly spayed, I got my diddly spayed
I got my diddly spayed, I got my diddly
She laughs about it
Shrinking inflections if the wind blows just right
Jacking themselves off polyester
I wanna jump, this isn't right, hey, when am I getting it back?
I got my diddly spayed, I got my diddly spayed
I got my diddly spayed, I got my diddly
I don't know why
I got a joke too silly to say
Don't touch the balls
I got a dick, dick, hear my fucking hate
I got my diddly spayed, I got my diddly spayed
I got my diddly spayed, I got my diddly
If you're wondering it's gaining monthly
Fiberglass insulated disguised as cotton candy
Spawning downstream, El Rancho Ovulate
Feeling can't help me romp
Bill just fuck me, take me anal
Billy's slit reminds me of someone
I'm sick of paying for the Love Boat
Toni and Tennille, Sonny, Bono, Charo
Had a nice set of lungs
I got my diddly spayed, I got my liberty
I got my diddly spayed, I got my diddly spayed
I got no house
Nowhere they fall
I got a hit, hit
Well, you can't live, I got my diddly spayed
I got my diddly spayed, I got my diddly spayed
I got my diddly spayed, I got my diddly spayed
I got my diddly spayed, I got my diddly
