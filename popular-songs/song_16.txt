There's a fire starting in my heart,
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bring me out the dark.
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare.
See how I'll leave, with every piece of you 
Don't underestimate the things that I will do.
There's a fire starting in my heart,
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bring me out the dark.
The scars of your love, remind me of us.
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
 I can't feeling
We could of had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside your hand
And you played it to the beat
Baby I have no story to be told
But I've heard one of you and I'm gonna make your head burn, 
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there as mine sure won't be shared
The scars of your love, remind you of us.
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
 I can't feeling
We could of had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside your hand
And you played it to the beat
We could of had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside your hand
But you played it with a beating
Throw your soul threw every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow
(I wish you never gonna miss you)
We could of had it all
We could of had it all (I wish you never gonna miss you)
It all(3 times)
We could of had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside your hand
And you played it to the beat
We could of had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside your hand
But you played it, 
You played it,
You played it
You played it to the beat
