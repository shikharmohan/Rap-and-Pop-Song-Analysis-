I was looking in the mirror,
Trying to find, a new reflection.
Wanna take the road, less traveled in, a different direction.
Make some new mistakes, forget the ones I've made.
Cry some tears of joy, dress more like a boy.
And come back as a blonde, try a different lipstick on
As a blonde, will I get whatever I want?
I'll be ever so eticing,
Cake a lot of icing, never have to watch my weight.
Yeah when I'm gone,
I'm gonna come back as a blonde.
I wanna I meet myself, as someone else, 
Just to see what it feels like.
Take a walk, on the other side,
'Cuz you know that I just might.
Break some different hearts, finish what i start.
I'm not gonna wait, and mess around with fate.
And come back as a blonde, try a different lipstick on
As a blonde, will I get whatever I want?
I'll be ever so eticing,
Cake a lot of icing, never have to watch my weight.
Yeah when I'm gone,
I'm gonna come back as a blonde.
I'm tainted, I'm tired of being the same yeah.
I'm desperate,
I'm bored,
I'm begging for change.
What if you're normal and wanna be strange
Come back, come back, come back.
Come back, come back, come back.
And come back as a blonde, try a different lipstick on
As a blonde, will I get whatever I want?
I'd be ever so eticing,
Cake a lot of icing, never have to watch my weight.
Yeah when I'm gone,
I'm gonna come back as a blonde.
Wave my magic wand,
As a blonde, will I get whatever I want?
I'll be ever so enticing,
Down a lot of ice cream, never even wipe my face.
Yeah when I'm gone,
I'm gonna...
Come back come back come back come back come back come back 
As a blonde.
