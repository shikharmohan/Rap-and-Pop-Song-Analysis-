We need to be together, he ain't gon buy you nothin' better
I don't wanna depress ya, I don't mess with them heffers
Baby, you under pressure, all of them Italian leathers
All them gifts on the regular, brand new Phantom umbrella
You wrong girl, we even got matchin' perfume and cologne girl
Ain't no other nigga gon be touchin' your thong girl
You mine, ain't no denyin'
Even witness me cryin', take some time to rewind
This bullshit, two human beings in love

I got your name tattooed
You think that's enough for make me to go nuts like cashews
Not my soul like we be callin' black fool
I mean devil knows you prolly fucked another dude
I gave you that rose, that ring when I proposed to you
Got rid of my gold teeth 'cause your mama nail, oops
And shot at them fools who touch your brother, now boo
And now you gon' tell me we should slow it down, who?
Not Flo Rida, I provide the Campbell soup
We'll sit by the dock, I spoon fed you Theraflu
You gotsa to be hot, women, I ain't 'bout to lose
Get out this house, I pay tuition on your school
I mean to my knowledge until the end it's me and you

I don't care what those other people say, I don't care
They don't understand w-w-why I feel this way
Baby, baby I don't care what those other people say, I don't care
