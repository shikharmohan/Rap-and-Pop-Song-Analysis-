Walks in the rain and talks in the dark
Old black and white movies, a day at the park
On a blanket on the ground on a Sunday afternoon
Hangin' with friends or off by ourselves
Drivin' around, yard sale to yard sale
Droppin' by the county fair, winnin' you a bear, poppin' balloons
If you're lookin' for someone to do that with, here I am
Someone to be the other half of your plans
Don't look any further than in my eyes
If you're lookin' for that man, here I am
December nights, all cuddled up
Warmed by the fire and sharin' a cup
Of hot cocoa and laughin' at old photos
Spanish guitars, sand and the sea
And quiet little table and just you and me
Sippin' margaritas in a little cantina in Old Mexico
If you're lookin' for someone to do that with, here I am
Someone to be the other half of your plans
Don't look any further than in my eyes
If you're lookin' for that man, here I am
Talkin' 'bout life and talkin' 'bout babies
Talkin' 'bout us, still in love when we're eighty
Yeah, if you're lookin' for someone to do that with, here I am
Someone to be the other half of your plans
Don't look any further than in my eyes
If you're lookin' for that man, here I am, here I am
Baby, here I am
