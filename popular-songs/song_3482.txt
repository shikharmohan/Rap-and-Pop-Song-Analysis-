I gave up pimento cheese
D-D-Domino's delivery
Whiskey sours, apple pies
Finger lickin' chicken fried
Are gastronomic history
I used to like them scary shows
But I gave 'em up a while ago
Don't do no death defyin'
Roller coaster ridin'
Now a days I just take it slow
Ever since we started datin'
I been compensatin'
To keep from gettin' up
To hell any quicker
'Cause she's hard on the ticker
Hard on the ticker
That girl is such a hazard
That she oughta have a sticker
Sayin' hard on the ticker
Now, when she wiggles through my door
My chin gets heavy hits the floor
Silky hair scarlet lips
Swingin' double jointed hips
My blood begins to roar
And when she nibbles on my ear
It's partly pleasure, partly fear
Little dab is all it takes
To get my heart a palpatatin'
Feelin' like the end is near
I oughta get a policy
A double indemnity
It'd make my beneficiary
A whole lot richer
'Cause she's hard on the ticker
(Hard on the ticker)
Hard on the ticker
(Hard on the ticker)
The girl is such a hazard
That she oughta have a sticker
Sayin' hard on the ticker
That's my girl
Yeah, she's hard on the ticker
I oughta get a policy
A double indemnity
Make my beneficiary
A whole lot richer
Because she's hard on the ticker
(Hard on the ticker)
Hard on the ticker
(Hard on the ticker)
The girl is such a hazard
That she oughta have a sticker
Sayin' hard on the ticker
Oh, she's hard on the ticker
Hard on the ticker
She's hard on the ticker
Hey, she's hard on the ticker
