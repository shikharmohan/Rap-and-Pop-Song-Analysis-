Verse 1
You got that budda love, that kinda love to make me fall in love again
Pour it in a Bottle Baby, I cant get enough of it.
Addicted to this Cronic , got me floating high up in the sky, sky
In the Cronic then I close my eyes & Im in love with you
Now we're on to something, baby tell me what you wanna do.
First I was reluctant, til you touched me then I gave it a try, try
Bridge: 
Love me, early in the morning
Make me feel so special, every time, time
Love me, early in the morning
Make me feel so special, look in my eyes, eyes
Chorus : x2
Baby Im warning you
You gon' make me fall hard for you
And when I fall hard for you
Imma give this love to you
Imma make it go, (Up and Down)
Cause you make me go , (Up and Down)
Imma make it go, (Up and Down)
Cause you make me go , (Up and Down)

And now we're making music, melodies are taking over you
Caught up in the moment, keep it going I'm involved with you

Imma give 100, what you give I'll give it back to you
Drive me crazy baby, be the leader show me what to do
Yeahhhhh, I like that, that
