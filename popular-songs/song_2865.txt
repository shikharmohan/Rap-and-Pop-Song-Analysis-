(tommie connor)
Christmas toys all over the place
Little shelby wears a funny smile on his face
Shelby has a secret
And the secret he must share
He wants to tell somebody
So he tells his teddy bear
Chorus:
I saw mama kissing santa claus
Underneath the misteltoe last night
She didn't see me creep
Down the stairs to have a peek(it says peep but go with peek)
She thought that I was tucked up in my bedroom fast asleep
Then, I saw mama tickle santa claus
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh, what a laugh it would have been
If daddy had only seen
Mama kissing santa claus last night
Repeat chorus
