Father, meet me with Your arms wide open
The world's done broken Your Prodigal Son
Down that road I, traveled
Everything raveled only came undone
Father, lead me down to the river
Wash me in the water 'til I'm whiter than snow
I know I'm not worthy
But tell me there's mercy for the wanderin' soul
I lost my way but now I'm on my knees
If it's not too late, won't You tell me please?
You gotta place for me
A little grace for me
Father, meet me in the cool green valley
In all of Your glory, when my days are done
Name me as one of Your chosen
Heaven's unbroken Prodigal Son
Father, meet me with Your arms wide open
Lead me down to the river
Meet me in the cool green valley
Name me one of Your chosen
Heaven's unbroken Prodigal Son
