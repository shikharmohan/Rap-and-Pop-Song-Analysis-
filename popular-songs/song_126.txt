When you look back on times we had, I hope you smile
And know that through the good and through the bad
I was on your side when nobody could hold us down
We claimed the brightest star
And we, we came so far and no they won't forget
Whenever you remember times gone by
Remember how we held our heads so high
When all this world was there for us
And we believe that we could touch the sky
Whenever you remember, I'll be there
Remember how we reached that dream together
Whenever you remember
When you think back on all we've done, I hope you're proud
When you look back and see how far we've come
It was our time to shine and nobody could hold us down
They thought they'd see us fall
But we, we stood so tall and no we won't forget
Whenever you remember times gone by
Remember how we held our heads so high
When all this world was there for us
And we believe that we could touch the sky
Whenever you remember, I'll be there
Remember how we reached that dream together
Whenever you remember, yeah ooh
We claimed the brightest star
And we, we came so far
And know that we showed them all
And no they won't forget, yeah
Whenever you remember times gone by
Remember how we held our heads so high
When all this world was there for us
And we believe that we could touch the sky
Whenever you remember, I'll be there
Remember how we reached that dream together
Whenever you remember, whenever you remember
Ooh, whenever you remember
