One for the Devil, two for my God
Father please forgive me while I rock this broad
Tormented
I've been lovin' coochie since it was
Invented
Ask me does it get me, yes it does
Feels lovely
Pink or brown without even with fuzz
They love me
All up on me off up in the club
Addicted
Gotta get her off in the room get her out them panties
Get wicked
Get her in the bed real quick get hit with a whammy
Can't shake it
Try to pass it by but homey I
Can't make it
If it was non-existent I would die
Stay with me
I don't want to ever let it go
A quickie
Beat it down like I'm Riddick Bo
Real stiffly
We can do it fast or even slow
I'll lift thee
Up on the bed or on the floor
Obsessed with
Pussy coochie nani on my mind

Get wicked
Feel me up I'll try to fight a crew
Don't touch me
Bouncer want to show me to the door
Don't rush me
Please partner, I don't want to go
Shame on me
Chuckin' ain't a damn thing changed
Rain on me
Fuck it do it till I feel the flame
Don't test me
Try to fight 'em fair no lead
Get messy
But the alcohol said, go ahead
Can't stop it
Alcohol is taken over blood
Don't mock it

Rollers try to get it not the jingle but the fold up
Stackin' papers and the coppers can't control us
Chasin' relish 'til my fuckin' pockets swoll up
God, forgive me but the heavens got to hold up
Get it quickly is you wit me this a sho nuff
Don't be bitchy 5150 hit the dough up
Killer hippies niggas wish we never showed up
Don't be dummy get that money daddy told us
Got to steppin' daddy left and never showed us
So we started pushin' weed and pushin' boulders
For Tony Roma on the corner 'til we blowed up
Get it sewed up
Tormented
