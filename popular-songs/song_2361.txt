Can you feel the noise?
'Coz it goes boy, boy, boy
Can you feel the noise
Boy, boy, boy? All night
I respect your cry
Don't mean to hit you up on a work night
But what I gotta do, girl?
Baby, can't you bend them rules?
'Coz tonight I wanna bend you
I promise it won't hurt, oh yes
Stop actin' like I'm actin' up
Cuttin' off the cut up
Worked up like what the fuck?
Won't you pick up the phone?
Girl, I know you alone
'Coz you the only one, I'm stuck
Did I miss that cut off time?
Used to be down, did I drop the dime?
Hey shawty, I'm comin' home
Big daddy tryna make you moan
You gon' miss out
She said, "It's cut off time"
She said, "It's cut off time"
She said, she said, "No, not tonight
This time I mean it, mean it"
She said, "It's cut off time"
She said, "It's cut off time"
She said, she said, "No, not tonight
This time I mean it, mean it"
Boy, we've been through this before
Boy, don't want this anymore, oh
Stop frontin', tell me
Who you think you're foolin'
Playin' hard to get
I'm hard to get, oh
Ain't tryna do nothin', oh, unless it's you
Tell me that you can resist, girl
Stop actin' like I'm actin' up
Cuttin' off the cut up
Worked up like what the fuck?
Won't you pick up the phone?
Girl, I know you alone
'Coz you the only one, I'm stuck
Did I miss that cut off time?
Used to be down, did I drop the dime?
Hey shawty, I'm comin' home
Big daddy tryna make you moan
You gon' miss out
She said, "It's cut off time"
She said, "It's cut off time"
She said, she said, "No, not tonight
This time I mean it, mean it"
She said, "It's cut off time"
She said, "It's cut off time"
She said, she said, "No, not tonight
This time I mean it, mean it"
