One word, that's all you said
Somethin' in your voice caused me to turn my head.
Your smile, just captured me
And you were in my future as far as I could see
And I don't know how it happened
But it happened still
You asked me if I love you
If I always will
Well you had me from "Hello", I felt love start to grow
The moment that I looked into your eyes, you won me
It was over from the start, you completely stole my heart
And now you won't let go
I never even had a chance you know
You had me from "Hello"
Inside, I built the walls
So high around my heart, I thought I'd never fall
One touch, you brought it down
The bricks of my defenses scattered on the ground
And I swore to me
I wasn't gonna love again
The last time was the last time
I let someone in
But you, had me from "Hello", and I felt love start to grow
The moment that I looked into your eyes, you won me
It was over from the start, you completely stole my heart
And now you won't let go
I never even had the chance you know
You had me from "Hello"
That's all you said
Somethin' in your voice caused me to, turn my head
You had me from "Hello"
You had me from "Hello"
Girl, I've loved you from "Hello"
