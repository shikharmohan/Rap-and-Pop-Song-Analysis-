Mamma, she's still got that picture
Of me and Katie on home coming night
She looked pretty in that fancy dress
But that girl was a barefoot, blue jean princess
A hand full of rocks and daddy's pine ladder
Sure did come in handy
For a teenage boy thinking all that mattered
Was a kiss that taste like candy
Back in the day we were wild and free
She was my dashboard drummer
Butterflies in the backseat
Little footprints on my window
Parking my Chevy by the riverside
Four letters in a heart carved in a pine
A little sun dress laying up there on the bank
While the water washed our innocence away
Back in the day
Friday nights I'd look up there in the bleachers
And I can see her with my letter man's jacket on
And I still got this scar here on my right hand
From when Bobby told her she deserved a better man
Aw, she hung right with me down in Panama City
Raising hell on our senior trip
And man ain't it funny it gets the best of me
And I just can't forget, I just can't forget
Back in the day we were wild and free
She was the dashboard drummer
Butterflies in the backseat
Little footprints on my window
Parking my Chevy by the riverside
Four letters in a heart carved in a pine
A little sun dress laying up there on the bank
While the water washed our innocence away
Back in the day
Summer was over
My college was calling man I had to watch her leave
But I still wonder if she ever thinks of me
'Cause back in the day we were wild and free
She was my dashboard drummer
Butterflies in the backseat
Little footprints on my window
Parking my Chevy by the riverside
Four letters in a heart carved in a pine
A little sun dress laying up there on the bank
While the water washed our innocence away
It feels like yesterday, back in the day
Back in the day
