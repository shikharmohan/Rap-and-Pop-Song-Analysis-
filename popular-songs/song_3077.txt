Oh, oh, oh, it's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
I never been awake, I never seen a day break
Leaning on my pillow in the morning
A lazy day in bed, music in my head
Crazy music playing in the morning light
Oh, oh, oh, it's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
Another sunny day, and dreamin' far away
Dreaming on my pillow in the morning
Never been awake, I never seen a day break
Leaning on my pillow in the morning light
Oh, oh, oh, it's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
Oh, oh, oh, it's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
Never believe
