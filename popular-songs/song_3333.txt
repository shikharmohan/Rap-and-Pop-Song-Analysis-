If I lived and breathed before you loved me, I don't recall
If I walked around at all, it was in bits and pieces of a jagged heart
You kissed me and every piece went back in place
Every pain got erased, you held me up to the sun light, now it feels like
No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken
And I never got lost, spent years in the dark
You're here, now my heart's unbroken
When I see your smile
Fill my soul again and I'm unbroken
If I doubted the power of love, baby, now I understand
I thank God for every day I wake up
To the soft touch of your magic hands
In this world sometimes the only thing that's real
Is the way you make me feel
Babe, the changes day and night, I swear it's like
No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken
And I never got lost, spent years in the dark
You're here, now my heart's unbroken
When I see your smile
Fill my soul again and I'm unbroken
I still see the night, I fell into your eyes
And when we made love it felt like the first time
No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken
And I never got lost, spent years in the dark
You're here, now my heart's unbroken
When I see your smile
Fill my soul again and I'm unbroken
Hey, I'm unbroken
Oh hey, I'm unbroken
No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken
And I never got lost, spent years in the dark
You're here, now my heart's unbroken
No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken
I never got lost, spent years in the dark
You're here, now my heart's unbroken
No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken
