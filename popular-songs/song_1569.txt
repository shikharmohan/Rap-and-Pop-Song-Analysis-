We are sitting here in silence
No one talking at all
And when I get home
You never give me a call
Is it what I said
What I did
I am really sorry
(Chorus)
I want you back
Here in my heart
I want you back
Going to the start
I want you back
This is driving me crazy
I want you back
This could all go away mabey
You are hanging out with her
When you use to hang out with me
I am really sorry
And I want you to see
My sincer apology
When I see you 
It feels like my heart is in two
(chorus)
I said you hated me
when you really don't
I am so sorry
please forgive me
I apologize for what I have done
(chorus)
You used to be my friend
why did it have to end
We have been friends forever
through whatever
When I am feeling down
You always come around
(chorus)
