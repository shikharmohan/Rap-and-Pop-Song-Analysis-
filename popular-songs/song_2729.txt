Sometimes you treat me so cruel
I don't think I can take it
Sometimes you hurt me so bad
I just wanna die
But in a moment like this
With a tender touch an' a lover's kiss
You put all of my pain aside
And I say to you with my eyes
Do right by me and make it last forever
Tonight I need to be here in your arms
Where the hurting ends and the love begins
Do right by me and I'll never do you wrong
It feels so good to be so close
Like we were when we started
Ooh, back when the troubles were few
And the lovin' was blind
Funny how people so close
Know the things to say that can hurt the most
Baby why can't we just be kind
And capture this moment in time
Do right by me and make it last forever
Tonight I need to be here in your arms
Where the hurting ends and the love begins
Do right by me and I'll never do you wrong
Do right
(Do right)
By me
(By me)
Eeh
Baby baby baby
Do right
(Do right)
By me
 (By me)
You
  (Do right)
Hey, baby baby baby
  (By me)
Do right
(Do right)
By me
(By me)
Ooh
(Do right)
Woh
(By me)
Do right by me and I'll never do you wrong
