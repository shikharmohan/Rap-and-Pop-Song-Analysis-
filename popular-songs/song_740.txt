Forgiving him was the first thing I had to do
In order to move on
Forgetting him was not as easy to do
I had to teach myself to be strong
And it's so easy to be scared
When I think of all that I shared
When I think of how he made me feel
The bad and the good
Sometimes I wish I could take it back
But we can't go back, gotta keep moving
It's so good, don't wanna hear no would or could
Maybe I should have
Stayed with someone who never knew
That I was true
It's so good, now that I'm going forward
Now that I'm growing
Now that I'm knowing
Never gonna give up on
Never gonna give up on love
Never gonna give up, give up on love
I have to admit you were the only one
I thought I was wrong too
Tried to be someone I knew that I wasn't
I thought I could make myself happy with you
And it's so easy to be scared
When I think of all that I shared
When I think of how he made me feel
The bad and the good
Sometimes I wish I could take it back
But we can't go back, gotta keep moving
It's so good, don't wanna hear no would or could
Maybe I should have
Stayed with someone who never knew
That I was true
It's so good, now that I'm going forward
Now that I'm growing
Now that I'm knowing
Never gonna give up on
Never gonna give up on love
Never gonna give up, give up on love
I knew I was gonna get through it
Breaking up was hard to do but I had to do it
Time has something to do with me
Figuring it out what this is all about
When he came to me, when he comes to me
Gotta do what's best for me
It's so good, don't wanna hear no would or could
Maybe I should have
Stayed with someone who never knew
That I was true
It's so good, now that I'm going forward
Now that I'm growing
Now that I'm knowing
Never gonna give up on
Never gonna give up on love
Never gonna give up, give up on love
Never gonna give up on love
Never gonna give up on love, on love
