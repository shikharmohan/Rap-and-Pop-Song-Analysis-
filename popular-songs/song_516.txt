(Never)
Never give up, never hold your head down
Never fear no man, never trust anybody
Never say you can't, never, never, never
  (Never, never, never)
No
Never give up, never hold you head down
Never fear no man, never trust anybody
Never say you can't, no, no, no never
Momma said never be a quitter, never since I was young
Never been in my roots, don't let never make you a bum
Never, my only son, she said, never beggin', for crumbs
If never found out your slippin' then never might be a gun
Never think suicide, never steal, never lie
Never run up to a gunfight and think you gon' survive
Never that lil' 6 nuts, 6 is for the flies
Never become a snitch, if you would rather be a quiet
Never know 'em, never met 'em
Never seen that fella, never, never, never
When they put you in that room that's what you tell 'em
Hell never to the law, never I'm a be a star
Never catch me up to mar
Never worry, never bury, tears on your teen jersey
Keep it 42, be worthy, never go without the curry
Never the greatest of all time, you in a hurry
Never, it's too early, never have no mercy
(Never, never, never)
Never give up, never hold you head down
Never fear no man, never trust anybody
Never say you can't, never, never, never, no
Never give up, never hold you head down
Never fear no man, never trust anybody
Never say you can't, no, no, no never
Never cross a man as far as you can throw 'em
Never put ya fate at home, boy, y'all know 'em
Never get in the herd, never get into church
Never cook in your life buried 6 feet under dirt
Never hate, never envy others 'cause they getting cake
Never grind, never hustle, never see your dinner plate
Never be fake, never be a snake
Never play that shit dog till they bring that pepper spray
Never be scared, never hurt your head
Never 'cause if they was killers you would already be dead
Never pout, never ever have doubt
Never let that be the reason you still sleep on mommas couch
Never brag, never be stingy with cash
Never get in for business, mind your own, take 'em now
Never cry wolf, never daddy ma boo, never less than a survivor, never
 (Never, never)
Never give up, never hold your head down
Never fear no man, never trust anybody
Never say you can't, never, never, never
  (Never, never, never)
No
Never give up, never hold you head down
Never fear no man, never trust anybody
Never say you can't, no, no, no never
Don't be slick, never silent, don't be bricks
Never set your wig split, never rob your click
Never, never miss your blesses, never start second guessin'
Never get to heaven, never 'cause you missed the lesson
Never bite the hand that feed, never live in greed
Never succeed, never doin' dirty deeds
Never chunk, never give up on your hope
Under pressure dream big when it's rough, make a toast
Never sell your sole, never for some dough
Never diamonds, never pearls, when you die, never go
Never back down, never let your hat down
Never see no bully, let 'em know your background
Never cross the line, never cross your kind
Everyday let it be, never worry, never toss your mind
Never lose sleep, never 'cause you got beat
Never know peace, never when you in these streets
Never give up, never hold you head down
Never fear no man, never trust anybody
Never say you can't, never, never, never, no
Never give up, never hold you head down
Never fear no man, never trust anybody
Never say you can't, no, no, no never
Never, never, never
