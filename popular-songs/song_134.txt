I know you don't mean to be, mean to me
'Cause when you want to
You can make me feel like we belong
We belong
Lately, you make me feel all I am is a backup plan
I'll say I'm done and then you smile at me
And I'll forget everything I said
I'm dying to those eyes and into your eyes
You say you'll call, but I know you
You say you're coming home, but I know you
You say you'll call, but I know you won't
You say you'll call, but I know you won't
I wish you were where you're supposed to be
Close to me
But here I am just staring at this candle burning out
Still no sound
Footsteps on my stairs
Your voice anywhere
You say you'll call, but I know you
You say you're coming home, but I know you
You say you'll call, but I know you won't
You say you'll call, but I know you won't
You say you'll call, but I know you
You say you're coming home, but I know you
You say you'll call, but I know you won't
You say you'll call, but I know you won't
You say you'll call, but I know you won't
I know you won't
I know you, I know you, I know you, oh
