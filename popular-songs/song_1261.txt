Let's go
What happened to the man who used to take me
Straight into misery?
I want you back and now I must admit it shames me
How could this be?
Tell me what's this desperation
'Cause I don't recognize this change
I think I made a bad mistake
'Cause once I ran away, I loved you since the day
The day I broke your heart, it's more than I could take
I loved you since the day, the day we fell apart
Now everything is coming undone
'Cause you were the chance I can't afford to waste
I loved you since the day, the day we fell apart
I must admit the grass looks so much greener
On the other side
Since you left I notice now I'm so much meaner
And it's something I think I like
Tell me what's this desperation?
'Cause I don't recognize this change
I think I made a bad mistake
'Cause once I ran away, I loved you since the day
The day I broke your heart, it's more than I could take
I loved you since the day, the day we fell apart
Now everything is coming undone
'Cause you were the chance I can't afford to waste
I loved you since the day, the day we fell apart
I made a bad mistake, used to pay for your sins
Drowning you one more time and mend my wicked ways
'Cause once I ran away, I loved you since the day
The day I broke your heart, it's more than I could take
I loved you since the day, the day we fell apart
Now everything is coming undone
'Cause you were the chance I can't afford to waste
I loved you since the day, the day we fell apart
The day we fell apart
