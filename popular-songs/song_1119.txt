Hmm hmm hmm
Hmm hmm, hmm hmm
Hmm hmm hmm
Hmm hmm, hmm hmm
Well I can't believe, I'm sittin' here today
Pickin' on my banjo, with a big smile on my face
Writin' new words to an old school melody
Hey there ain't no doubt that God's been good to me
Oh, the sun is shinin' on down in Tennessee
Right now I'm round where I wanna be
I've never felt so loved, so peaceful and so free
Hey, there ain't no doubt that God's been good to me
'Cause he put me, smack down in the middle of paradise
In the heart on the city where my dreams come alive
And everythin' I have, and everythin' I see
Is just another reminder, God's been good to me
Hmm hmm
Hmm hmm, hmm hmm
This golden road's been long, sometimes I've lost my way
I've been down some darkened detours, leanin' heavy on my faith
With the devil at my chain, all your love don't set me free
Hallelujah, God's been good to me
And 'cause he put me, smack down in the middle of paradise
In the heart of the city where my dreams have come alive
And everythin' I have, and everythin' I see
Is just another reminder, God's been good to me
I say how, oh
You were present in my heart
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
And He put me, smack down in the middle of paradise
In the heart of the city where my dreams have come alive
And everythin' I have, and everything I see
Is just another reminder, God's been good to me
Is just another reminder, God's been good to me
Woh yeah yeah, God's been good to me
Oh hmm
Hmm hmm, hmm hmm
Hmm hmm, hmm hmm
Hmm hmm, hmm hmm
Come on and sing with another man
hmm hmm hmm, yeah
hmm hmm hmm
