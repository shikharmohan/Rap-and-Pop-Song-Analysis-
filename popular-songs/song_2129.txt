I'm a negative creep and I'm stoned
I'm a negative creep, I'm a negative creep

Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
This is out of our range, this is out of our range
This is out of our range and it's grown

I'm a negative creep, I'm a negative creep
I'm a negative creep and I'm stoned
I'm a negative creep, I'm a negative creep
I'm a negative creep and I'm
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Yeah!
Drone!
Stoned!
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
