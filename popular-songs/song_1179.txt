We all drink to forget, some of us more than most
When reality gets too real and the fires of hell to close
But I'm here to let you know that that you can make it through
If you believe that someone is watchin' over you
And call it an angel, call it a muse
And call it karma that you've got comin' to you
What's the difference? What's in a name?
What matters most is never ever losin' faith
'Cause it's gonna be alright, you're not alone tonight
And we all have our days when nothing goes as planned
Not a soul in the world seems to understand
And for someone to talk to, you'd give anything
Well go on and cry out loud 'cause someone's listenin'
Yeah, and call it an angel, call it a muse
And call it karma that you've got comin' to you
What's the difference? What's in a name?
What matters most is never ever losin' faith
'Cause it's gonna be alright, you're not alone tonight
Keep your faith alive
You're not the only one
Yeah, and call it an angel, call it a muse
Call it karma that you've got comin' to you
What's the difference? What's in a name?
What matters most is never ever losin' faith
Yeah, you're gonna be alright, you're not alone tonight
Oh you can cry if you want to, go on
