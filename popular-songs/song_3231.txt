The warning of the one who's coming
Sending divine authority
The prophecy says
That people will flock to him
He will give them false hope
And when he's in power
He will destroy everything
He will change everything with one voice
If that one voice can change one person
It can change many
Many can change a city
A city can change a state
A state can change the nation
The nation can change the world
What if he is the King Of Darkness?
