There's a new wind blowing like I've never known
I'm breathing deeper than I've ever done
And it sure feels good to finally feel the way I do
I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you
And I'm letting go of all my lonely yesterdays
I've forgiven myself for the mistakes I've made
Now there's just one thing, the only thing I wanna do
I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you
Yeah, I wanna feel the sunshine
Shining down on me and you
When you put your arms around me
You let me know there's nothing in this world I can't do
I used to run in circles going no where fast
I'd take one step forward and look two steps back
I couldn't walk a straight line even if I wanted to
I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you
Whoa, here we go now
Yeah, hey, I wanna love you, baby
Yeah, I wanna feel the sunshine
Shining down on me and you
When you put your arms around me
Well baby, there ain't nothing in this world I can't do
Sometimes it's hard for me to understand
But you're teaching me to be a better man
I don't want to take this life for granted like I used to do
I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you
I'm ready to love somebody, love somebody like you
And I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you
(Yeah)
Hey, I wanna love you, baby
