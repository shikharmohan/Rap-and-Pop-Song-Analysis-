I used to be a little bit shy, I kept my deepest feelings inside
Speaking up to you about my emotions has always been hard
But this just can't wait, tonight I feel a little bit brave
So I won't let one more day pass without you explaining what we are
This is gonna sound kind of silly but I couldn't help but notice
The last time you kissed me you kept both eyes open
Baby can you tell me what does that mean?
If you're looking over your shoulder then you don't need to be with me
And I don't need to hold on
Don't let me stop you from doing what you wanna do
You don't wanna stick, trust me it's cool, take no chance, get over you
No, no don't let me stop you, if you wanna leave baby you can leave
Just don't pretend that you're into me if it ain't true
No don't let me stop you
I'm out of things I can take, gotta high threshold for pain
Let's get one thing straight I'm not down to share you with anyone
If that's not what you're looking for, nice knowing you but there's the door
'Cause I know I can find someone who give me what I want
This is gonna sound kind of silly
If you're looking over your shoulder then you don't need to be with me
And I don't need to hold on
Don't let me stop you from doing what you wanna do
You don't wanna stick, trust me it's cool, take no chance, get over you
No, no, don't let me stop you, if you wanna leave baby you can leave
Just don't pretend that you're into me if it ain't true
No don't let me stop you
Even if I end up broken hearted I won't lie
I don't wanna hear goodbye but either way I'll be alright
Don't let me stop you from doing what you wanna do
You don't wanna stick, trust me it's cool, take no chance, get over you
No, no, don't let me stop you, if you wanna leave baby you can leave
Just don't pretend that you're into me if it ain't true
No don't let me stop you
Don't let me stop you from doing what you wanna do
You don't wanna stick, trust me it's cool, take no chance, get over you
No, no, don't let me stop you, if you wanna leave baby you can leave
Just don't pretend that you're into me if it ain't true
No don't let me stop you
