She comes home late at night
kicks her high-heels off inside
and lays down on the bed
she said its been a long day at work
couldnt wait till i got home
just to be with you again
Lord I love just to watch her sleeping
I just pull the covers up and wonder what she's dreaming
Chorus
Well she's wrapped up with a tshirt on.
got the lights turned way down low
radio has got her favorite song
and man she's singing right along.
let your hair down baby let if fall
rip the phone cord out the wall
whisper love you while you're drifting off again
whenever we're alone yeah
I took her out last Friday night
let her dance under neon lights
and that girl she's turning heads
Stranger's eyes right on my girl
I can't blame them man she's beautiful
she's coming home with me
And Lord her beauty its hard too hide
i'm countin my blessings every night
Well she's wrapped up with a tshirt on.
got the lights turned way down low
radio has got her favorite song
and man she's singing right along.
let your hair down baby let if fall
rip the phone cord out the wall
whisper love you while you're drifting off again
whenever we're alone 
whenever we're alone
Well she's wrapped up with a tshirt on.
got the lights turned way down low
radio has got her favorite song
and man she's singing right along.
let your hair down baby let if fall
rip the phone cord out the wall
whisper love you while wyou're drifting off 
whenever we're alone
