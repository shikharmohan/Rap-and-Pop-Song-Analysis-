The bed is cold and empty in the morning light
I'm searching for my pride through tangled covers
And loneliness is not a very pretty sight
When you first discover
That it's over a hard one to lose, love hurts, it's sad but true
He wanted my arms around him, oh without a doubt
He wanted my warm red lips soft on his mouth
He loved all of me except for one small part
He wanted everything, everything but my heart
Love is not an easy word for me right now
Too much has happened to my feelings
It's gonna be rough not having him around
Until time has done some healing
And it's over and I'm over you, love hurts, it's sad but true
He wanted my arms around him, oh without a doubt
He wanted my warm red lips soft on his mouth
He loved all of me except for one small part
He wanted everything, everything but my heart
