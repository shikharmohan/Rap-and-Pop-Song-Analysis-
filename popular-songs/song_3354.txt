Don't you remember
The fizz in a pepper
Peanuts in a bottle
At ten, two and four
A fried bologna sandwich
With mayo and tomato
Sittin' round the table
Don't happen much anymore
We've gotten too complicated
It's all way over-rated
I like the old and out-dated
Way of life
Back when a hoe was a hoe
Coke was a Coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said, "I'm down with that"
Well, it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when
I love my records
Black and shiny vinyl
Clicks and pops and white noise
Man, they sounded fine
I had my favorite stations
The ones that played them all
Country, Soul and Rock and Roll
What happened to those times?
I'm readin' street slang for dummies
'Cause they put pop in my Country
I want more for my money
The way it was back then
Back when a hoe was a hoe
Coke was a Coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said, "I'm down with that"
Well, it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when
Give me a flat top for strumming
I want the whole world a-humming
Whoa, just keep it coming
The way it was back then
Back when a hoe was a hoe
Coke was a Coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said, "I'm down with that"
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when
