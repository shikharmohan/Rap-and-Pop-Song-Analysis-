Oh, I tried to get to you
Push it in vain to break me through
I tried with all I had
You left me standing empty handed
Well, times has passed
Nothing ever lasts
So now you confess that you need me
And now you release what you're feeling
But how is this suppose to ever be the same?
Oh, it's a shame, it's a shame
Oh, it's a shame, no, it's a shame, yeah
You got the best of me
Got me a reason, got me on my knees, yeah
My love, I lost my pride
Searching for something I couldn't find
Well, time apart
Has brought a change of heart
And now you confess that you need me
And now more or less what you're feeling
But how is this suppose to ever be the same?
Oh, it's a shame, it's a shame
Oh, it's a shame, no, it's a shame, yeah
You got the best of me
I said, "Love got the best of me"
Saying, "You got the best of me"
And I'm afraid it will never be the same
It's a shame, it's a shame
Oh, it's a shame, no, it's a shame
Oh, it's a shame, it's a shame
Oh, it's a shame, no, it's a shame, yeah, yeah
Oh, you got the best of me, ooh, ooh, ooh
