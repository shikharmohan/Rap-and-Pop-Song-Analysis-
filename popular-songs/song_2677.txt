Away in a manger, no crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet head
The stars in the sky look down where he lay
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay
The cradle are glowing the baby awakes
The little Lord Jesus, no crying he makes
I love you Lord Jesus, look down from the sky
And stay by my cradle till morning is nigh
Be near me Lord Jesus, I ask you to stay
Close by forever and love me I pray
Bless all the dear children in your tender care
And fit us for heaven to live with you there
