(Ryan McCord / Dierks Bentley)
I never thought I'd see the day
That she'd set me free
Cause you know that little ring on my finger
Always felt like a ball and chain to me
All those threats I made about leavin
Suddenly became reality
She released me from my death row sentence
And said we'll sign the final papers in a week
Chorus
She handed me my walking papers
And said you're free to go
And celebrating felt in order
For I had escaped that prison of a home
But sittin in this old tavern
Surrounded by my good timing friends
I see I'll never make it on the outside
And I'm thinkin bout how I'm gonna break back in
Daylight found me sleepin in my car
On the other side of her street
And the grass that used to be my front yard
Had never before looked so green
And I'm tempted to break for the front door
But I'm sure she'd sic the dogs on me
Cause it looks like she's got a new inmate
Cause there's a pickup in the drive I've never seen
Chorus
I'm thinkin about how I'm gonna break back in
