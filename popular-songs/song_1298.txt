Is this a dream?
If it is please, don't wake me from this high
I've become comfortably numb, until you opened up my eyes
To what it's like when everything's right, I can't believe
You found me when no one else was lookin'
How did you know just where I would be?
Yeah, you broke through all of my confusion
The ups and the downs and you still didn't leave
I guess that you saw what nobody could see
You found me, you found me
So, here we are and that's pretty far
When you think of where we've been
No going back, I'm fading out, all that has faded me within
You're by my side, now everything's fine, I can't believe
You found me when no one else was lookin'
How did you know just where I would be?
Yeah, you broke through all of my confusion
The ups and the downs and you still didn't leave
I guess that you saw what nobody could see
You found me, you found me
And I was hiding 'til you came along
And showed me where I belong
You found me when no one else was lookin'
How did you know? How did you know?
You found me when no one else was lookin'
How did you know just where I would be?
Yeah, you broke through all of my confusion
The ups and the downs and you still didn't leave
I guess that you saw what nobody could see
You found me, you found me
You broke through all of my confusion
The ups and the downs and you still didn't leave
I guess that you saw what nobody could see
The good and the bad and the things in between
You found me, you found me
