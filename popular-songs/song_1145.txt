Hello blue stranger, sittin' there all alone
With your glass of sorrow you seem so far from home
Maybe you will let me buy a round or two
I'm a blue stranger too
Hello blue stranger, I haven't seen you around
But I know every reason for leavin' town
We might know each other before the night is through
I'm a blue stranger too
And strangers fall in love everyday
All lovers were strangers once
Just like us, a little unsure of their ways
Well hello blue stranger, will you take a chance?
I might be mistaken but I see meaning in your glance
Maybe this could be the start of something new
I'm a blue stranger too
And strangers fall in love all the time
All lovers were strangers once
Just like us, a little unsure of sharin' eyes
Hello blue stranger, sittin' there all alone
With you glass of sorrow you seem so far away from home
Maybe you will let me buy you a round or two
I'm a blue stranger too
Hello blue stranger, hello blue stranger
Hello blue stranger
