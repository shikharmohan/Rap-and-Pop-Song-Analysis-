It's feelin so right to me
Hearin your voice sayin my name
It's feelin so right to me
Holdin you here, there's nothin I'd change
It's feelin so good to know
I can let my true heart show
It's what I've been waiting for
I'venever been so sure
chorus
With you I am free to be myself
With you I can trust somebody else
With you I show the deepest part of who I am
With you I learned the meaning of
giving it all and being in love
With every step
With every breath
With You I Am
It's feelin so right to me
Dancin with you here in the dark
It's feelin so right to me
showin you how important you are
You make it so easy to open up my heart to you
I never have to hide the way I feel inside
chorus
With you I am free to be myself
With you I can trust somebody else
With you I show the deepest part of who I am
With you I learned the meaning of
giving it all and being in love
With every step
With every breath
With You I Am
instrumental break
With You I Am
With you I can (I can)
With you I show the deepest part of who I am
With You I am 
With you I can
With you I show the deepest part of who I am
With you I learned the meaning of 
giving it all and beign in love
With every step
With every breath
With You I Am
With every step
With every breath
With You I Am
