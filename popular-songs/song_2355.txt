Oh (Shorty, Imma grind, I can grind, now comÃÂ¢€on)(4x)
Verse 1:
She worth every hour that I put in
If I had to do it over, IÃÂ¢€d do it again
SheÃÂ¢€s the girl that every captain wants to save
And I canÃÂ¢€t let her get away
Bridge:
Imma hustle harder
Hard enough to keep her
Player donÃÂ¢€t even bother
IÃÂ¢€ll never leave her
Chorus:
IÃÂ¢€m on my grind (grind, grind, grind)
All day, all night
IÃÂ¢€m on my grind (grind, grind, grind)
Like I ainÃÂ¢€t made a dime
IÃÂ¢€m on my grind (grind, grind, grind)
Like a 9 to 5 with no pay
IÃÂ¢€ll do it all, whatever it takes
On the real, IÃÂ¢€m about mine
IÃÂ¢€m on my grind
Verse 2:
Like a feen for her, I canÃÂ¢€t wait
IÃÂ¢€m like an alcoholic, I need a taste
IÃÂ¢€m on the block just so I can keep you fly
They say IÃÂ¢€m trickin but I donÃÂ¢€t mind
Bridge:
Imma hustle harder
Hard enough to keep her
Player donÃÂ¢€t even bother
IÃÂ¢€ll never leave her
Chorus:
IÃÂ¢€m on my grind (grind, grind, grind)
All day, all night
IÃÂ¢€m on my grind (grind, grind, grind)
Like I ainÃÂ¢€t made a dime
IÃÂ¢€m on my grind (grind, grind, grind)
Like a 9 to 5 with no pay
IÃÂ¢€ll do it all, whatever it takes
On the real, IÃÂ¢€m about mine
IÃÂ¢€m on my grind
Oh (Shorty, Imma grind, I can grind, now comÃÂ¢€on)(4x)
Bridge:
Imma hustle harder
Hard enough to keep her
Player donÃÂ¢€t even bother
IÃÂ¢€ll never leave her
Chorus:
IÃÂ¢€m on my grind (grind, grind, grind)
All day, all night
IÃÂ¢€m on my grind (grind, grind, grind)
Like I ainÃÂ¢€t made a dime
IÃÂ¢€m on my grind (grind, grind, grind)
Like a 9 to 5 with no pay
IÃÂ¢€ll do it all, whatever it takes
On the real, IÃÂ¢€m about mine
IÃÂ¢€m on my grind
