Ohh, ohh, ohh
Don't let it fool you brother
Beware of what you see
You've been consumed
By all your visions of luxuries
Betrayed your friends and brother
Bridges that carry you
But when you need them later
They won't be there for you
You're so high now
You think you'll never fall
But when you come down
Who will you call
Whatchu gonna do when your money's blown
Your friends are gone and you're all alone
Now you gotta be hangin' on
With no where else to run to
You should know it won't make you whole
You gain the world but you lose your soul
Spend your life in the search of dough
You find out it just won't save you
No, no, no, no
You think that having money brings joy and peace to you
But the pursuit of it might bring out the beast in you
She's the American dream but can't face reality
That what your chasing only lasts temporarily
You're so high now
Someday you're gonna fall
But when you come down
Who will you call
Whatchu gonna do when your money's blown
Your friends are gone and you're all alone
Now you gotta be hangin' on
With no where else to run to
You should know it won't make you whole
You gain the world but you lose your soul
Spend your life in the search of dough
You find out it just won't save you
Whatchu gonna do when your money's blown
Your friends are gone and you're all alone
Now you gotta be hangin' on
With no where else to run to
You should know it won't make you whole
You gain the world but you lose your soul
Spend your life in the search of dough
You find out it just won't save you
