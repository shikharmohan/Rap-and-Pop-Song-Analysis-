Is this how it is when it's over
Between a woman and man?
Must tomorrow just keep on being
Today all over again
You made it look so easy
Falling for somebody new
But I must be going about it all wrong
For I just can't stop loving you
Is this how it is when it's over
Between a woman and man?
Must tomorrow just keep on being
Today all over again
This morning I reached out to touch you
A habit I've held for so long
But I just started hurting all over again
Like I have ever since you've been gone
Is this how it is when it's over
Between a woman and man?
Must tomorrow just keep on being
Today all over again, today all over again
