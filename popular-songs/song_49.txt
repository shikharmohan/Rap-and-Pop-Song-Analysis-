I remember lookin' up to look up to him
And I remember most of the time he wasn't there
I'd be waitin' at the door when he got home at night
He'd pass me by to go pass out in his chair
And I'd say, walk a little straighter, daddy
You're swayin' side to side
Your footsteps make me dizzy and no matter how I try
I keep trippin' and stumblin', if you'd look down here you'd see
Walk a little straighter daddy, you're leading me
He stumbled in the gym on Graduation Day
And I couldn't help but feel so ashamed
And I wasn't surprised a bit when he didn't stay
He stumbled out before they called my name
And I thought, walk a little straighter, daddy
You're swayin' side to side
It's not just me who's watchin' you've caught everybody's eye
And you're trippin' and stumblin' and even though I've turned 18
Walk a little straighter, daddy you're still leading me
The old man's still like he always was but I love him anyway
If I've learned one thing from him it's my kids will never have to say
Walk a little straighter, daddy, you're swayin' side to side
Your footsteps make me dizzy and no matter how I try
I keep trippin' and stumblin', if you'd look down here you'd see
Walk a little straighter, daddy you're leading me
Yeah, walk a little straighter, daddy you're leading me
