What'cha gonna do with the 36 cents
Sticky with Coke on your floorboard 
When a woman on the street is huddled in the cold
On a sidewalk vent trying to keep warm
Do you call her over hand her the change 
Ask her a story ask her her name 
Or do you tell yourself 
You're just a fool 
Just a fool 
To believe you can change the world 
You're just a fool 
Just a fool 
To believe you can change the world
What'cha gonna do when you're watching t.v. 
And an ad comes on 
Yeah you know the kind 
Flashin' up pictures of a child in need 
For a dime a day you can save a life 
Do you call the number reach out a hand 
Or do you change the channel call it a scam 
Or do you tell yourself 
You're just a fool 
Just a fool 
To believe you can change the world 
Don't listen to them when they say 
You're just a fool 
Just a fool 
To believe you can change the world
Oh the smallest thing can make all the difference 
Love is alive 
Don't listen to them when they say 
You're just a fool 
Just a fool 
To believe you can change the world 
The worlds so big it could break your heart 
And you just wanna help 
But not sure where to start 
so you close your eyes 
Send up a prayer into the dark 
You're just a fool 
Just a fool 
To believe you can change the world 
Don't listen to them when they say 
You're just a fool 
Just a fool 
To believe you can change the world 
Oh the smallest thing can make all the difference 
Love is alive 
Don't you listen to them when they say 
You're just a fool 
Just a fool 
To believe you can change the world
