I prefer yellow roses to daisies
I'll take the mountains over a postcard view
I'll order steaks every time instead of hot dogs
And that's why I chose him over you
I like to love somebody and had somebody love me
I like happiness instead of being blue
I like to talk real late at night after making love
And that's the reasons I chose him over you
Well I don't know how I ever did without him
And I don't understand why I put up with you
But all I know that sun shines the brightest when you're happy
And that's the reasons I chose him over you
So go ahead and think just what you want to
But I promise what I just told you is true
Oh I love him so much and he loves me too
And that's the reasons I chose him over you
Just some of the reasons I chose him over you
Over you
