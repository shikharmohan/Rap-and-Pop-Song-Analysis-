I memorize your special code
I can get in anytime I want
You say I'm just a bit too bold
Know you want it, telling me you don't
Girl what's your problem
I think you know good and well
Ain't nobody stroking like me
Girl I'm your problem
Made you set that bar high as hell
I ain't what you want but I'm what you need
Well, can't nobody do it better
And you know it, you do
Can't nobody get it wetter
Say you know it, it's true
'Cuz I love sex with my ex girlfriend
I, I love sex with my ex girlfriend
I really like the way you go
Begging me to not kiss right there
Oh and you suddenly just lose control
Begging me to smack it and pull your hair
Babe, understand you got a new man
Telling me that you're in love, okay
Oh girl that's your thing
Long as you understand I get mine anytime
Night and through the day
Can't nobody do it better
And you know it, you do
Can't nobody get it wetter
Say you know it, it's true
I, I love sex with my ex girlfriend
I, I love sex with my ex girlfriend
Can't nobody do it like I do it and you know it
One thing that it's always gone be true is once mine always mine
And you know it, you do
Say you know it, it's true
I, I love sex with my ex girlfriend
I, I love sex with my ex girlfriend
