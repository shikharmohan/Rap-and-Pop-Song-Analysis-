Lookin' out on the morning rain
I used to feel so uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Oh, it'd make me feel so tired
Before the day I met you, life was so unkind
But you're the key to my piece of mind
'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
(Woman)
When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me, no
Still your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm living for
'Cause if I make you happy I don't need to do more
'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
(Woman)
Oh, baby watcha done to me?
Ooh, you make me feel so good inside
And I just a-wanna be
Close to you, you make me feel so alive
You make me feel
You make me feel
(Oh, you make me feel)
You make me feel like a natural woman
(Woman)
You make me feel
(Oh, you make me feel)
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
