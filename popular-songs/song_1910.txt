I was in the studio
Doing what I do, When she 
crept. in ever so gently
Walked over and just looked at me
(Is there a problem?)- I said
She just stood staring in my eyes
Wondering, why no reply
Suddenly she begins to cry
(Baby we need to talk)
Then she begins, asking me about the weekend
She went out the town with 3 friends
Just her and the girls
(Do you remember?)
And she says - baby
I haven't been very honest lately
And I don't want you to hate me
But baby, I got a confess right now - (She said)
Told you I was out with my friends (But)
I was really with another man
Just sat that smiling like, (So) Baby wont you tell me something I don't already know
Said, Baby I'm not a fool
(And) I done been known about you (Yeah)
Wanna come clean out, I don't think so
Baby wont you tell me something I don't already know
She looked a bit shocked and
suddenly her tears just stopped
As I started breaking down her plot
Telling her things she thought I did not (Nooo)
Told her too, of the chicks she was suppose to be with
All out of town, hanging out in shhh...
Came here looking for you, said they haven't seen you in a week or two
So I put to and to together, and figure out you have a special friend
Next thing on my mind was
revenge (So)
So me and your two friends, the time we had was great
If you don't believe me, then watch the tape
I put it with the rest of your stuff, along with the ticket for the greyhound bus
What did you think, was gonna happen when you say?
Told you I was out with my friends (But)
I was really with another man
Just sat that smiling like, (So) Baby wont you tell me something I don't already know
Said, Baby I'm not a fool
(And) I done been known about you (Yeah)
Wanna come clean now, I don't think so
Baby wont you tell me something I don't already know
So then I said, forgive me..
For letting you believe..
Then I was naive.. I'm Sorry
Now if you can give me.. that extra set of keys
'cuz you wont need 'em anymore... 'cuz you was out the door before..
Told you I was out with my friends (But)
I was really with another man
Just sat that smiling like, (So) Baby wont you tell me something I don't already know
Said, Baby I'm not a fool
(And) I done been known about you
Wanna come clean now, I don't think so
Baby wont you tell me something I don't already know
