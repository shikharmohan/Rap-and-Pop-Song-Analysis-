I'm gonna be a modern day drifter
And get out while I can
Gonna trade in this life I've been livin'
For a pocket full of sand
And a modern day drifter don't have to tell no one his plans
I'm gonna find that long stretch of highway
Where no one knows my name
Where as long as the sky just goes on
And it's never the same
A modern day drifter don't ever complain
Bye, bye, hi life
Feels like the right time
To say so long keep on goin' strong
And I'll just keep on bein' gone
'Cause I'm gonna be a modern day drifter
Yes I am
I'm gonna slip this ring off my finger
'Cause everybody understands
That a modern day drifter's got nothin' but time on his hands
Bye bye hi life
It feels like the right time
To say so long keep on goin' strong
And I'll just keep on bein' gone
'Cause I'm gonna be a modern day drifter
Oh yes I am
I'm gonna slip this ring off my finger
'Cause everybody understands
That a modern day drifter's got nothin' but time on his hands
