Now I stared at you from across the room
Until both my eyes were faded
I was in a rush, I was out of luck
Now I'm so glad I waited
Well you were almost there, almost mine, yeah
They say love ain't fair but I'm doing fine
'Cause I swear it's you, I swear it's you
I swear it's you that I've waited for
And I swear it's you, I swear it's you
I swear it's you that my heart beats for
And it ain't gonna stop, no it just won't stop
Now you are fire by night but when the morning light comes
Comfortable as rain on Sunday
And I'm a lucky soul that holds your hand so tight
Hope you hear this one day
Don't fool yourself this is my truth
I swear it's you, I swear it's you
I swear it's you that I've waited for
I swear it's you, I swear it's you
I swear it's you that my heart beats for
And it ain't gonna stop, it just won't stop
You take this hand, you take this heart
Stir my bones from a thousand miles apart
It feels so cold without you like it's ten shades of winter
And I need the sun
And I swear it's you, I swear it's you
I swear it's you I waited for
I swear it's you, I swear it's you
I swear it's you that my heart beats for
I swear it's you, I swear it's you
I swear it's you that I've waited for
I swear it's you, I swear it's you
I swear it's you that my heart beats for
And it ain't gonna stop, it just won't stop
It just won't stop, it just won't stop no
I swear it's you, I swear it's you, oh yeah
