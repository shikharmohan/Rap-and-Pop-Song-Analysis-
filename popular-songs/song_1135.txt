Lately I've been noticing
I say the same things he used to say
And I even find myself
Acting the very same way
I tap my fingers on the table to the rhythm in my soul
And I jingle the car keys when I'm ready to go
And when I look in the mirror he's right there in my eyes
Starin' back at me and I realize
The older I get the more I can see
How much he loved my mother and my brother and me
And he did the best that he could
And I only hope when I have my own family
That everyday I see
A little more of my father in me
There were times I thought he was bein'
Just a little bit hard on me
But now I understand he was makin' me
Become the man he knew that I could be
In everything he ever did he always did with love
And I'm proud today to say I'm his son
When somebody says I hope I get to meet your dad
I just smile and say you already have
The older I get the more I can see
How much he loved my mother and my brother and me
And he did the best that he could
And I only hope when I have my own family
That everyday I see
A little more of my father in me
He's in my eyes my heart, my soul
My hands, my pride and when I feel alone
And I think I can't go on I hear him sayin' "Son you'll be alright
Everything is gonna be alright" Yes it is
The older I get the more I can see
That he loved my mother and my brother and me
And he did the best that he could
And I only hope when I have my own family
That everyday I see, oh I hope I see
I hope everyday I see a little more of my father in me
A little more of my father in me
I hope everyday I see in me
In me, in me
I hope everyday I see
A little more of my father in me
