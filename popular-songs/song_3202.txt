The strangest, straight derangest
Strange
(Strawn Jay)
Strange
Uh, Midwest side, hit that Bombay
Let's get it on, raps new phenomenon
Hit 'em up with the flippers and rupture your dome
Me calm down, never you say me song sound like butt
You say, I'm washed up? Nigga, what, what, what?
This is when I kick, kick it with this rhythmic syphilis
Fuck dem 9 rhymes, make 'em go blind every time
On that cannabis and it is not for the mini mind
But the mind of a gage high
On stage 'cause minimum wage had me in a maximum rage
Page masta scrap, the velosoraptor of rap
See me, come tight like a pig in a bikini
Please, all emcees know I be on my Q's and P's
Even Run D.M.C., I'm a deadly disease
High voltage, just take a look at the psychosis
Deranged, I claimed the man's plain atrocious
Flows be constant, I rock from here to Wisconsin
My killer flow makes me jerk my Johnson
He's strange and I like it
He's strange
(All day all night)
Just the way he is
(Uh, like this)
Tecca Nina, Tecca Nina
(Wassup?)
Why you so damn psycho?
(Couldn't tell ya baby, I'm makin' rella baby, flippin' hella baby)
(Ask your nearest fortune teller, baby, strange)
Mushroom headed keeps me prophetic
But that slow motion makes me see life like a movie
The Bombay brother with the ganja stick
It'll get you stuck if you let
Calm me, but no calming Aron Dante
Just call me the strange or strange Bombay
Distinguishing the kcuf from tihs
From hip hop comes this
Apocalypse got control of your hips
A, it's beautimous, hella rap metamorphosis
MC corpsesis around me
They found me jacuzzin' with my sorceresses
Fire up the Vega and get blowed
And roll to a spot with Biancs
Then bust hoes in their olds
So different they wanna kill me like they killed Bruce Lee
What? On the set, no shet
Saw my Bianc with bagets
Midwest flex flows, likes to sex those
Little wet flesh holes, insane brain frames
Never that plane Jane
He's strange and I like it
He's strange
(All day all night)
Just the way he is
(Uh, like this)
Tecca Nina, Tecca Nina
(Wassup?)
Why you so damn psycho?
(Couldn't tell ya baby, I'm makin' rella baby, flippin' hella baby)
(Ask your nearest fortune teller, baby, strange)
I can give myself a C-section
With a rusty jagged weapon
Bungee wit 100 feet of slack
In front of my kids with no discretion
Strange days like Juliet Lewis
And Angela Basset off in a casket
Trippin with the 9
Get your mind blown like a head gasket
Mizzery's in the house for the '99 shot
Futuristic ladies love me a whole whole lot
When demons try to do me Jew
They know they wicked
So I bust 'em if you ain't down with 3DQ
Who be you? Nina Tech, respect, Midwest Side
For life, grab a mic, and hurt you like a La' Bianca murder
The sound lab got my microchip screwed
Ah shit, malfunction back words, this, kcuf, uoy, mub, now I'm cool
Pain givers, slang spitters, hang niggas, insane figures
No shame aim triggas, lame brain splitters, vein slitter, gang critters
Dame hitters, Wayne livers, narcotical strange nigga
He's strange and I like it
He's strange
(All day all night)
Just the way he is
(Uh, like this)
Tecca Nina, Tecca Nina
(Wassup?)
Why you so damn psycho?
(Couldn't tell ya baby, I'm makin' rella baby, flippin' hella baby)
(Ask your nearest fortune teller, baby, strange)
