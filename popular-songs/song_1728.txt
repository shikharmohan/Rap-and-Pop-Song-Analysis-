Take the world
Shakin', stirrin'
That's what I've goin' on
I throw my cares up in the air
And I don't think they're comin' down
Yeah, I love how it feels right now
This is the life!
Hold on tight!
And this is the dream!
It's all I need!
You never know where you'll find it
And I'm gonna take my time, yeah
I'm still getting it right
This is the life
Takin' in a whole new scene
And I'm swimmin' with a new crowd
Breakin' down the old four walls
And I'm building them up from the ground
Yeah, I love how it feels right now
This is the life!
Hold on tight!
And this is the dream!
It's all I need!
You never know where you'll find it
And I'm gonna take my time, yeah
I'm still getting it right
This is the life
I'm gonna follow my own lead, yeah
Kick back and feel the breeze
Nothing but the blue sky
As far as I can see
This is the life
Hold on tight
And this is the dream
It's all I need
You never know where you'll find it
And I'm gonna take my time, yeah
I'm still getting it right
This is the life!
Hold on tight!
And this is the dream!
It's all I need!
You never know where you'll find it
And I'm gonna take my time, yeah
I'm still getting it right
This is the life
