I'm livin' in a world that won't stop pullin' on me
I'm not complaining but it's true
It's like I owe my time to everyone else
'Cause that's all I seem to do
You might not notice but I need a good friend
Someone to talk to when I'm down, down, down
There's so much on my mind that I wanna get out
But there's no one around
Well sometimes I can't help thinkin', oh what about me?
Some days go by that I don't even see
Yeah I'm doing everything right and I can't break free
Oh is this the way it's always gonna be, what about me?
Well I'm dreamin' I'm on a highway with the windows down
I'm burnin' up the road at my own speed
But I'm stuck here goin' nowhere in this traffic jam
And there's a woman with her kids in the car next to me
And I swear she's singin'
Sometimes I can't help thinkin', oh what about me?
Some days go by that I don't even see
Yeah I'm doing everything right and I can't break free
Is this the way it's always gonna be, hey, what about me?
Oh, sometimes I can't help thinkin', oh what about me?
Some days go by that I don't even see
I'm doing everything right and I can't break free
Oh is this the way it's always gonna be, what about me?
Ooo what about me, baby?
Hey what about me?
