Let's be honest, you're not flawless
But you're as close as anything I've seen
You're not the woman that you envisioned
But your life is not a broken time machine
No, it's not that bad
You know, it's really not that bad
Little midnight Chardonnay smooth the edges off the day
A little taste of Mary Jane makes you feel young again
All those years around your eyes always take you by surprise
You've been living in a dream, forever seventeen
A reckless lover, a father figure
You search for both in every man you meet
You're not a mother but sometimes you wonder
A son or daughter just might make you feel complete
No, you don't need someone else
You know, it's hard enough to learn to love yourself
Little midnight Chardonnay smooth the edges off the day
A little taste of Mary Jane makes you feel young again
All those years around your eyes always take you by surprise
You've been living in a dream, forever seventeen
Little midnight Chardonnay smooth the edges off the day
A little taste of Mary Jane makes you feel young again
All those years around your eyes always take you by surprise
You've been living in a dream, forever, forever seventeen
