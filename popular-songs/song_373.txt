I left that sun sinkin' west in California
I was supposed to stay in L.A. a few more weeks
But the next time that old sun and I meet up
I'll be a thousand miles east
Fifty dollars and a gas card in my pocket
That I'm thinkin' might already be maxed out
Yeah, that's just one of those little crazy things
I really didn't stop to think about
'Cause when a man wants to be with a woman
There ain't no way of gettin' there too fast
And when you know who you wanna spend
The rest of your life with, you wanna start
The rest of your life as soon as you can
That state trooper let me off with just a warnin'
And a promise that I'd try to slow her down
Man, that promise was forgotten
By the time I'd gotten two miles outta town
'Cause when a man wants to be with a woman
There ain't no way of gettin' there too fast
When you know who you wanna spend
The rest of your life with, you wanna start
The rest of your life as soon as you can
I don't know how much a truck can handle
But the closer that I get, I keep pushin' it
'Cause when a man wants to be with a woman
There ain't no way of gettin' there too fast
And when you know who you wanna spend
The rest of your life with, you wanna start
The rest of your life, you can't wait to start
The rest of your life as soon as you can
As soon as you can, as soon as you can, yeah
