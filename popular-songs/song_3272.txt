(Verse 1)
Raised in the middle of the land full of bar-b-que stands and the brothers throw hands
Everybody grittin gettin grands
Kansas City were the pretty women make you say DWAM!
Kicks it like a donkey cause we famous
Wicked women want me cause I came up
This is were the homies trip and say what
Yo we from the "Show-Me" get my money, p-p-pay up
Got on my 501's and my gritter posture
I fit her proper, if she papered I'm in her choppers
Lettin her know this ninna dinner cost her
And I'm finna squash her 
So animal like someone better get her doctor
This boy is born and raised in KC, M.I.Z.Z.O.U.
But once in a while I hit the L.K. (Lawrence, KS) for ladies
Cause they straight be, in KU
Then back to Kansas City were it's Gates all on they plate
We think about it and we crave it when we vacate
I represent the MO and all the way to K-State
Call me Tech N9ne but teachers and students call me A. Yates
 
(Hook)
I'm hella fine like the food at Ollie Gate's
Strawberry, baked bean, mixed plate
So everybody just bounce, rock, skate
Can't wait O.G. Ollie Gates

Ya we do it but the fire ain't brought like this

If the other city's Q is G.O.O.D.
But he knew that I would find out slowly
Just like my KC bar-b-que they cannot hold me, A. Yates
