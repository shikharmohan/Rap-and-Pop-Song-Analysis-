1,2,3,
Everybody come on, off your seats
I'm gonna tell you about a beat
That's gonna make you move your feet
I'll get the Bar-B-Q show
And tell you how to move
If your 5 or 82
This is something you can do (woah-woah)
Pop it, lock it
Polka-dot it
Country-fy it
Then hip-hop it
Put your hawk in the sky
Move side to side
Jump to the left
Stick it glide
Zigzag cross the floor
Shuffle in diagonal
When the drum hits
Hands on your hips
One foot in, 1-80 twist
I said a,
Zigzag, step n' slide
Lean in left
And clap three times
Shake it out
Head to toe
Throw it all together
That's how we roll
Do the hoedown (throwdown)
Do the hoedown (throwdown)
Do the hoedown (throwdown)
Throw it all together
That's how we roll
We get to 4, 5, 6
And your feelin busted
But it's not time to quit
Practice makes you perfect (woah-woah)
Pop it, lock it
Polka-dot it
Country-fy it
And hip-hop it
Put your hawk in the sky
Move side to side
Jump to the left
Stick it glide
Zigzag cross the floor
Shuffle in diagonal
When the drum hits
Hands on your hips
One foot in 1-80 twist
I said a,
Zigzag, step n' slide
Lean in left
And clap three times
Shake it out
Head to toe
Throw it all together
That's how we roll
Do the hoedown (throwdown)
Do the hoedown (throwdown)
Do the hoedown (throwdown)
Throw it all together
That's how we roll
Boom dee clap dee clap

Pop it, lock it

Put your hawk in the sky

Shuffle in diagonal
When the drum hits
Hands on your hips
One foot in 1-80 twist
And then a
Zigzag, step and slide
Lean in left
