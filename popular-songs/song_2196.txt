Like most babies smell like butter
His smell smelled like no other
He was born scentless and senseless
He was born a scentless apprentice
Go away, go away, go away!
Every wet nurse refused to feed him
Electrolytes smell like semen
I promise not to sell your perfumed secrets
There are countless formulas for pressing flowers
Go away, go away, go away!
I lie in the soil and fertilize mushrooms
Leakin' out gas fumes are made into perfume
You can't fire me because I quit
Throw me in the fire and I won't throw a fit
Go away, go away, go away, go away
Go away, go away, go away!
