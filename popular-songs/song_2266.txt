What else should I be? All apologies
What else could I say? Everyone is gay
What else could I write? I don't have the right
What else should I be? All apologies
In the sun, in the sun I feel as one
In the sun, in the sun
Married, buried
I wish I was like you easily amused
Find my nest of salt, everything is my fault
I'll take all the blame, aqua seafoam shame
Sunburn, freezerburn, choking on the ashes of her enemy
In the sun, in the sun I feel as one
In the sun, in the sun
Married, married
Married, buried
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
