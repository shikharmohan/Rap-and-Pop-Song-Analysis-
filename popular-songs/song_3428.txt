Damn, I hope no one dies on this night shift tonight
Always lit up like a Roman candle
Everybody comes in like they're looking for a fight
I'll have to tell his family, as he rides off to heaven
And twenty minutes later I'm drinkin' my coffee down at the 7/11
I'm workin', yeah, I'm workin'
All theses truckers out here drive with one hand on the wheel
And a cellphone to their ear
Apologizing for somethin' they missed or can't get too
I'm sorry too, my dear
Yeah but that's the way it goes and we sure need the money
This life of ours is far from perfect, ain't it, honey?
But I'm workin', baby, I'm workin'
So make the kids do their homework
Before you put them to bed
And there's dinner in the fridge
Make sure everybody gets fed
And I know, I won't get to see you
Before you leave for your day
I guess it's the only time that we get to say
I love you, baby, I love you
So the last kid's on the school bus
As I lay me down to sleep
And I keep hurryin' and worryin' and wonderin' and prayin'
For all my soul can keep
And I know I couldn't do it
If you weren't there
There'd be no home to come home to
No reason to care
So I just had to call you before I faded away
I guess it's the only time that we get to say
I love you, baby, I love you
I love you, I love you
Damn, I hope no one dies on this night shift tonight
