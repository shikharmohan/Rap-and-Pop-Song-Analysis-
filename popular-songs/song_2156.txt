Monkey see, monkey do
{Away}
Grab at me to be cool
{Away}
Hear the line engine rhyme
{Away}
There's just one of us blind
{Away}
Stay
Stay away
Stay away
Stay away
Give an inch, take a smile
{Away}
Scratch an itch, scratch a style
{Away}
Throw it out, keep it in
{Away}
Have to have poison skin
{Away}
Stay
Stay away
Stay away
Stay away
Stay
Stay away
Stay away
Stay away
Monkey see, monkey do
{Away}
Grab at me to be cool
{Away}
Hear the line engine rhyme
{Away}
There's just one of us blind
{Away}
Stay
Stay away
Stay away
Stay away
Stay
Stay away
Stay away
Stay away
Stay
Stay away
Stay away
Stay away
Stay away
Stay away
Got to stay
