Another long summer's come and gone
I don't know why it always ends this way
The boardwalk's quiet and the carnival rides
Are as empty as my broken heart tonight
But I close my eyes and one more time
We're spinnin' around and you're holdin' on tightly
The words came out, I kissed your mouth
No Fourth of July has ever burned so brightly
You had to go I understand
But you promised you'd be back again
And so I wander around this town
'Til summer comes around
I got a job workin' at the old park pier
And every summer now for five long years
I grease the gears, fix the lights, tighten bolts, and straighten the tracks
And I count the days 'til you just might come back
And then I close my eyes and one more time
We're spinnin' around and you're holdin' on tightly
The words came out, I kissed your mouth
No Fourth of July has ever burned so brightly
You had to go I understand
But you swore that you'd be back again
And so I'm frozen in this town
'Til summer comes around
And it comes around
Oh and I close my eyes and you and I
Are stuck on the Ferris wheel ridin' with the motion
And hand in hand we cried and laughed
Knowin' that love belonged to us, girl, if only for a moment
"Baby I'll be back again", you whispered in my ear
But now the winter wind is the only sound
And everythin' is closin' down
'Til summer comes around
'Til summer comes around
'Til it comes around and it comes around
And I miss you baby
And I miss you baby
And you're comin' back around
And you're comin' back around
