sitting all alone
on the porch waiting
for you to come around but
you don't oooh yeah. and then
I remember that you are gone yeahh.
(Chours)(Kelly)
Where is the feeling that
I used to know when would make love.
where is the feeling we used to know and
than I wonder where did the feeling go.
(kalan)
I think of you all
the time even if the feeling
is there or not but I hope you that
the feeling is still there for me
but I just can't wait for you to come
around. But still where did the feeling go.
(Chours)
Where is the feeling that
I used to know when would make love.
where is the feeling we used to know and
than I wonder where did the feeling go.
Where is the feeling that
I used to know when would make love.
where is the feeling we used to know and
than I wonder where did the feeling go.

I had to spend alone but know that
