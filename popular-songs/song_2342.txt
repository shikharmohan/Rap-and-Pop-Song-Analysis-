Hey
Excuse me if you find this sound dumb
Looks like somebody else got my wife
So tell me where the f*** you came from
  (Where you came from?)
I never seen nothin' like you in my life
So I closed my eyes and try
Not to think of your eyes
Not to think of your smile
And the face you're makin' now
Should've thought about that before
You came strollin' through the back door
The back door of my heart
Tearin' everythin' apart
I said oh, oh, oh no, no, I
I think I'm fallin' for you
(I think I'm fallin' for you)
I said oh, oh, oh no, no, I
I think I'm fallin' for you
(I think I'm fallin' for you)
Oh no, no, obsession
Oh no, no, obsession
Oh no, no, obsession
Hey
Okay, I gotta tell my mom about you
I hope this is okay in God's light
Yeah, He dropped you off here but He's not through
  (He is not through)
Grab my hand, help me pack up my life
So I closed my eyes and try
Not to think of your eyes
Not to think of your smile
And the face you're makin' now
Should've thought about that before
You came strollin' through the back door
The back door of my heart
Tearin' everythin' apart
I said oh, oh, oh no, no, I
I think I'm fallin' for you
(I think I'm fallin' for you)
I said oh, oh, oh no, no, I
I think I'm fallin' for you
(I think I'm fallin' for you)
Oh no, no, obsession
Oh no, no, obsession
Oh no, no, obsession
Hey
If you need, you can leave
And things would be the way they were, baby
But from what I see, you need
Someone to cool that fever from me
