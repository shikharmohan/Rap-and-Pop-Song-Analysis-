Can i get one more dance with you baby
This is our last chance, this is our last dance
Can i get one more dance with you baby
You lost in the moment, before the party's over
Verse 1:
I could just leave it, i realized i shouldn't be here
It does something right i don't need this, i can't see it
I don't wanna talk about this no more
Your here, i'm here our situation
Confusionally waiting with you every night
We are no more, washed away of sure
So take me in your arms for the last time
Chorus 2x:
Can i get one more dance with you baby
This is our last chance, this is our last dance
Can i get one more dance with you baby
You lost in the moment, before the party's over
Verse 2:
Don't stop til you get tired
Dance now you got me fired up
Last time you show me how
You're used to put it down
Once we leaved the floor with no more
Your here, i'm here our situation
Confusionally waiting with you every night
We are no more, washed away of sure
So take me in your arms for the last time
Chorus 2x:
Can i get one more dance with you baby
This is our last chance, this is our last dance
Can i get one more dance with you baby
You lost in the moment, before the party's over
Verse 3 (2x):
Let's go out the right way
Say goodbye politely
You don't have to fight me
Let's just fade our love away, away, away
Chorus 2x:
Can i get one more dance with you baby
This is our last chance, this is our last dance
Can i get one more dance with you baby
You lost in the moment, before the party's over
