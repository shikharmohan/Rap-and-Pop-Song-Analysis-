Dancin' when the stars go blue 
Dancin' when the evening fell 
Dancin' in your wooden shoes 
In a wedding gown 
Dancin' out on 7th street 
Dancin' through the underground 
Dancin' with the marionette 
Are you happy now 
Where do you go when you're lonely 
Where do you go when you're blue 
Where do you go when you're lonely 
I'll follow you when the stars go blue 
Stars go blue, stars go blueooooooo
Stars go blueooooo
Laughin' with your pretty mouth 
Laughin' with your broken eyes 
Laughin' with your lover's tongue 
In a lullaby 
Where do you go when you're lonely 
Where do you go when you're blue 
Where do you go when you're lonely 
I'll follow you when the stars go blue 
Stars go blue, stars go blue 
Stars go blue
