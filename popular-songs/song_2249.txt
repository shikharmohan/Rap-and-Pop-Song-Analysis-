She should've stayed away from friends
She should've had more time to spend
She should've died when she was born
She should've worn the crown of thorns
She should have been a son
She should have been a son
She should have been a son
She should have been a son
She should've stood out in a crowd
She should've made her mother proud
She should've fallen on her stance
She should've had another chance
She should have been a son
She should have been a son
She should have been a son
She should have been a son
Been a son
She should have been a son
She should have been a son
She should have been a son
She should've stayed away from friends
She should've had more time to spend
She should've died when she was born
She should've worn the crown of thorns
She should have been a son
She should have been a son
She should have been a son
She should have been a son
