A word's, just a word 
'Till you mean what you say 
And love, isn't love 
'Till you give it away 
We've all got to give 
Yeah something to give 
To make a change 
Send it on 
On and on 
Just one hand can heal another 
Be apart 
Reach your heart 
Just one spark stars a fire 
With one little action 
The chain reaction will never stop 
Make it Strong 
Shine a Light and Send it On 
Just smile (just smile) 
And the world (and the world) 
Will smile along with you 
That small act of love 
That's meant for one will become two 
If we take the chances 
And change circumstances 
Imagine all we can do 
If we... 
Send it on 
On and on 
Just one hand can heal another 
Be apart 
Reach your heart 
Just one spark stars a fire 
With one little action 
The chain reaction will never stop 
Make it Strong 
Shine a Light and Send it On 
Send it on 
There's Power in all of the choices we make 
So i'm starting now there's not a moment to wait 
A word's, just a word 
'Till you mean what you say 
And love, is no love 
'Till you give it away 
Send it on 
On and on 
Just one hand can heal another 
Be apart 
Reach your heart 
Just one spark stars a fire 
With one little action 
The chain reaction will never stop 
Make it Strong 
Shine a Light and Send it On 
Send it on 
Send it on 
On and on 
Just one hand can heal another 
Be apart 
Reach your heart 
Just one spark stars a fire 
With one little action 
The chain reaction will help things start 
Make it Strong 
Shine a Light and Send it On 
Shine a Light and Send it On 
Shine a Light and Send it On
