Saw him sittin on a sidewalk in Fresno
Braided hair and a tye-dyed t-shirt on
Talkin to himself about Vietnam
About the tour he did and the deal he got
He said this world ain't the same if you ask me.
If I could be somewhere else, I'd tell you where I'd be
I'd be rollin' on a river with Creedence
Stealin' kisses from Peggy Sue
I'd be knee-deep in sand on a Panama beach
In the spring of '72
I'd be wastin' away on the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide roll in
He said what I wouldn't give just to live those songs again.
Saw him workin' the counter at Walgreens
With a new haircut and a Bachelor's Degree
Talkin' to himself about his raw deal
Cussin' Uncle Sam and the GI bill
He said This world ain't the same if you ask me
If I could be somewhere else, I'd tell you where I'd be
I'd be rollin' on a river with Creedence
Stealin' kisses from Peggy Sue
I'd be knee-deep in sand on a Panama beach
In the spring of '72
I'd be wastin' away on the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide roll in
He said what I wouldn't give just to live those songs again.
