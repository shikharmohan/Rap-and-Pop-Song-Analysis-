Sprin's sprung, the sun's up and shinin'
School's out and everyone's smilin'
Let's pop the top off and lie for a while
And some take it easy days
Let's tell that old grind where to stick it
Put the rest of the stress in there with it
Don't you think we've had enough?
It's time to get away
It's gonna be another flip flop summer
Kick off your shoes and call up your lover
Say, "Hey baby, the winter is over
Let's head South awhile"
We're going to take us a long vacation
Mix us up some strong libations
No worries, just good vibrations
And lazy days in style
It's a flip flop summer, it's a flip flop summer
Put your coat away in the closet
You won't need it, baby
Because it's a clear blue sky
And the weatherman says it looks that way for weeks
Baby, we'll cruise down to Montigo
Raise us a glass as we pass Puerto Rico
It don't matter 'cause wherever we go
It's where it's good to be
It's gonna be another flip flop summer
Kick off your shoes and call up your lover
Say, "Hey baby, the winter is over
Let's head South awhile"
We're going to take us a long vacation
Mix us up some strong libations
No worries, just good vibrations
And lazy days in style
It's a flip flop summer, it's a flip flop summer
Let's sail away, where no problems can find us
We've got 90 days to watch that ole Tequila sun rise
And leave all our troubles behind us
It's gonna be another flip flop summer
Kick off your shoes and call up your lover
Say, "Hey baby, the winter is over
Let's head South awhile"
We're going to take us a long vacation
Mix us up some strong libations
No worries, just good vibrations
And lazy days in style
It's a flip flop summer, it's a flip flop summer
It's a flip flop summer
