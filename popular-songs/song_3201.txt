(1st Verse)
it's friday night and i
got my check man i
damn i really need a (PARTY)
so when the weekend come
i'm tryin to get beef then some (ALL NIGHT ALL DAY)
tryin to break the monotony
get away from my property
ain't no way that you stoppin me
at a party i got to be
but the (?tech?) was a shock to me
that will let my velocity slow
wanna party with me let me know	
we party cause we in pain
we party to celebrate
to keep from goin insane
we party just to escape
no matter how much the cost
regardless of what it takes
you call my phone and it's off
i'm tryin to numb the mistakes
but if you feel like you chill put yo cups up
but if you ill about yo bills and it's just touch
take a drink but don't spill
this ain't no time to be still
fuck the world, what you know, and realize shit is real
Chorus
shit is real (about 20 times)
(2nd verse)
saturday night and i
still got some check man i
damn i really need a (PARTY)
now that the weekend's here
it's time for the cheefin and beer (ALL NIGHT ALL DAY)
whether you puff or you're drinkin
when life is tough we go seekin
somethin to thrust or go deep in
work is rough with no freakin
so we lustfully speakin
girl, yo what's up for the weekend?
plan a trip to las vegas
a room at the venetian
lets go
we party cause we in pain
we party to celebrate
to keep from goin insane
we party just to escape
no matter how much the cost
regardless of what it takes
if you're found or you're lost
hey baby these are the breaks
but if you good it's understood that you prosperous
we from the hood and drinkin good means a lot to us
put away yo knife and yo steel
have some fun and you'll feel
like a shield has been lifted
yet and still shit is real
Chorus
(3rd Verse)
sunday night and i 
blew my check man i
(damn)damn i really wanna (PARTY)
now that the weekend's done
i'm tryin to sleep in some(ALL NIGHT ALL DAY)
hey yo this song's for the strong
not for the backboneless
workers who don't make enough for they own
but give to the homeless atonement
for the wrong that has grown 
strong for the long
spent time for dimes
you better take advantage of this moment
yo
we party cause we in pain
we party to celebrate
to keep from goin insane
we party just to escape
no matter how much the cost
regardless of what it takes
never put your trust in the state
they not controllin yo fate
but if you made it then i'll say you did yo thang today
but if you lost it then i'll say party yo pain away
do your job or your ??
don't lose control of the will
it's sunday night but on monday realize shit is real
