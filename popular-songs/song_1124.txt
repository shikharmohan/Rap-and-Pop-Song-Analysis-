Well, she was precious like a flower
She grew wild, wild but innocent
A perfect prayer in a desperate hour
She was everything beautiful and different
Stupid boy, you can't fence that in
Stupid boy, it's like holdin' back the wind
She laid her heart and soul right in your hands
And you stole her every dream and you crushed her plans
She never even knew she had a choice and that's what happens
When the only voice she hears is telling her she can't
Stupid boy, stupid boy
So what made you think you could take a life
And just push it, push it around?
I guess to build yourself up so high
You had to take her and break her down
Well, she laid her heart and soul right in your hands
And you stole her every dream and you crushed her plans
She never even knew she had a choice and that's what happens
When the only voice she hears is telling her she can't
You stupid boy, oh, you always had to be right
But now you lost the only thing
That ever made you feel alive
Yeah, yeah
Well, she laid her heart and soul right in your hands, yeah
And you stole her every dream and you crushed her plans, yes, you did
She never even knew she had a choice and that's what happens
When the only voice she hears is telling her she can't
You stupid boy
Oh, I'm the same old, same old stupid boy
It took a while for her to figure out
She could run but when she did
She was long gone, long gone
She's gone
Long gone
Yeah she is now
Yeah, ohh
On and on [incomprehensible]
She loved me, she loved me, she loved me
God, please, doesn't matter no
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry baby
Yeah, I don't believe
She's never coming back to me
