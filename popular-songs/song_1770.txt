ohh right now
I'm gonna tell you how I really feel about you
cause you still have no clue
& I can't believe you haven't figured out whats been on my mind
my hearts been permanently signed...by you
[chorus]
I can see the fire in your eyes
I can tell your sooo surprised
you never thought it all along
ohhh oh oh
but I've been dreaming of this day for so long
ohhh oh oh
I can't believe the rumors that I've heard
somebody tried to spread the word
things were better when you didn't know the truth
now I'm so confused
I can see the fire in your eyes
I can tell that your so surprised
you never thought it all along
ohhh oh oh
but I've been dreaming of this day for so long
ohhh oh oh
now that we've been together 
it seems like forever 
and all you seem to think about is you
and I don't know what to do
your just so far from the truth 
I can see the fire in your eyes 
I can tell your so surprised
you never thought it all along
ohhh oh oh
but I've been dreaming of this day for so long
ohhh oh oh
just tell me why
and I'll understand
then we'll walk hand in hand again
cause we've made all the plans
but I've decided that its time to say goodbye
all because I saw what was really in your eyes
ohhh oh oh la la la la la la la la laaa la la laaa
