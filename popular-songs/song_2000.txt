Damn it's been something
Like three years since we came to an end
Goodness I didn't realize, it's been that long
But anyways so good to hear that you
Moved on and found somebody new
So have I still baby something is wrong
You don't have to answer this if it's too personal
(Don't worry 'bout it)
Do your thoughts of me ever become sexual?
(Do I ever cross your mind?)
Ever reminisce on us on the bathroom floor?
On the counter or maybe in the tub
Or even on the sink
'Cuz lately what's been happening is
When I'm with my girl
I call your name and it just ain't right
That I'll be sexing her and I
I call your name and it just ain't right
Said it ain't no little thing that I
I call your name and it just ain't right
Do you ever do the same 'cuz I?
I call your name and it just ain't right
Needless to say to you
Me and my girl are almost through
Seems that she thinks that I'm not over us
That's crazy, ain't it?
But anyway just called to see
If you was experiencing
The same as me 'cuz if so
We've got some things to discuss
You don't have to answer this if it's too personal
(If it's too personal)
Do your thoughts of me ever become sexual?
(Do you ever reminisce?)
Ever reminisce on us on the bathroom floor?
Or the counter or maybe in the tub
Or even on the sink
'Cuz lately what's been happening is
When I'm with my girl
I call your name and it just ain't right
That I'll be sexing her and I
I call your name and it just ain't right
Said it ain't no little thing that I
I call your name and it just ain't right
Do you ever do the same 'cuz I?
I call your name and it just ain't right
Tell me the truth, could we still be in love?
(Could we be in love?)
Think of you though I know that it ain't right
Said do you think of me when you lay with him at night?
It's not that I'm lonely baby but I just can't help myself
I don't know if I'm still in love with you girl
But when I'm laying with her girl I call your name
When I'm with my girl
I call your name and it just ain't right
That I'll be sexing her and I
I call your name and it just ain't right
And it ain't no little thing that I
I call your name and it just ain't right
Do you ever do the same 'cuz I?
I call your name and it just ain't right
I call your name and it just ain't right
I call your name and it just ain't right
I call your name and it just ain't right
I call your name and it just ain't right
I call your name
