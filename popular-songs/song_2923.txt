We lie in the dark, I know you're awake
The only sounds are the sounds this old house makes
Oh, how I long, I long to hear your voice
Desperate to talk, yearning to touch
Burning inside 'cause I want you so much
So I say I need you and leave you no choice
You lie, you don't wanna hurt me
So you lie, buy a little time, and I go along
What else can I do, and maybe it's wrong
But you know how much I love you, so you lie
Till you can find a way to say goodbye, you lie
How long until you just can't go on
And the urge to break loose is just too strong
You should let go, that's what you wanna do
Oh but you don't know
(You don't know)
If it's the right thing to do
So you lie, you don't want to hurt me
So you lie, buy a little time, and I go along
What else can I do, and maybe it's wrong
But you know how much I love you, so you lie
Till you can find a way to say goodbye, oh you lie
You lie, oh you lie
Oh you lie, you lie
