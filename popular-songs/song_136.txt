One foot on the bus
Bout half past nine
I knew that you were leaving this time
I thought about laying down in its path
Thinking that you might get off for that
I remember that night we laid in bed
Naming all our kids that we hadn't had yet
One for your grandma and one for mine
Said we'd draw straws when it came time
I'll move on baby just like you
When the desert floods and the grass turns blue
When a sailing ship don't need her moon
It'll break my heart but I'll get through
Someday when I stop loving you
I bet all I had on a thing called love
Guess in the end it wasn't enough
And it's hard to watch you leave right now
I'm gonna have to let you go somehow
Somehow
I'll move on baby just like you
When the desert floods and the grass turns blue
When a sailing ship don't need her moon
It'll break my heart but I'll get through
Someday when I stop loving you
Oooh.. oh someday.. oh someday
I'll move on baby just like you
When the desert floods and the grass turns blue
When a sailing ship don't need her moon
It'll break my heart but I'll get through
Someday when I stop loving you
