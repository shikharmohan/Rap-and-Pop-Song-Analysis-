Why do I just lie awake and think of you?
I need some sleep, tomorrow I have things to do
Every time I close my eyes, I see your face
So I try to read, but all I do is lose my place
Am I obsessed with you?
I do my best not to want you
But I do all the time
I do all the time
I just had to call you up and say hello
I know it's 3 AM, and I saw you a while ago
But I still had this aching pain to hear your voice
To know you're there, I don't seem to have any choice
Am I obsessed with you?
I do my best not to want you
But I do all the time
Do all the time, ooh ya
I'm so sorry I just had to wake you up
I feel so lonely by myself
Is this the way it feels when you're in love?
Or is this something else? Ya
Am I obsessed with you?
I do my best not to want you
But I do all the time
I want you all the time
Ooh yeah
But I do all the time
I want you all the time
Am I obsessed with you?
