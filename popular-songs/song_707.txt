Would you mind if I took the time to get to know you?
'Cause it's been a while since all we been through
And even though I said my feelings wouldn't change
Nothing stays the same, ooh
I can see when I look in your eyes, you mean no harm
It's just the way you manipulate me with your charm
And I can tell the love I have for you still strong
And there ain't nothing wrong with me still loving you
After all that we been through
Found myself still loving you
But I think we need to take the time to get it right
'Cause I never gave up on a good thing
Never gave up on the love we had
We just need to take it slow
In the past, you would act as if you don't really care
You would fight and argue almost anywhere
Looking back sometimes I feel like such a fool
For puttin' up with you ooh
Baby please, understand me if it seems I'm confused
It's just it might take me some time to get used to you
When I think of all the things we used to do, baby
I just find myself still loving you
After all that we been through
Found myself still loving you
But I think we need to take the time to get it right
'Cause I never gave up on a good thing
Never gave up on the love we had, baby
We just need to take it slow
I believe you and me had a chance to make this right
Oh baby if your heart is in it, I'm still with it
Even after all of this time has passed
Oh I'm still loving you
After all that we been through
Found myself still loving you
But I think we need to take the time to get it right
'Cause I never gave up on a good thing
Never gave up on the love we had, baby
We just need to take it slow
After all that we been through
Found myself still loving you
But I think we need to take the time to get it right
'Cause I never gave up on a good thing
Never gave up on the love we had
We just need to take it slow
