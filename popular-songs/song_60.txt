I've been your lover, I've been your friend
I've been your faithful one woman man
I've been your diamond in the rough
Now you say you wanna polish me up
Why, why, why do you wanna change me now?
Ain't I the one you loved everything about?
You might start missin' the old me around
So why, why, why do you wanna change me now?
I remember you used to like
Walkin' with me on my wilder side
My kind of crazy, it turned you on
Do you really want that part of me gone?
Why, why, why do you wanna change me now?
Ain't I the one you loved everything about?
You might start missin' the old me around
So why, why, why do you wanna change me now?
Why, why, why?
Ain't I the one?
You might start missin'
Why, why, why do you wanna change me now?
Ain't I the one you loved everything about?
You might start missin' the old me around
So why, why, why do you wanna change me now?
Yeah, why, why, why do you wanna change me now?
Oh, yeah
