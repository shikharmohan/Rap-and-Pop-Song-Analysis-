Patience took you for everything
Looked like a diamond ring
You are so much longer
That made sense
Apathy in disguise
Crept on you like a spy
Hurt you in ways
You can't describe
Back to the start now
I wont let you go this way now
Honesty is what you need
It sets you free like someone to save you
Let it go but hurry now
There's undertow and I don't wanna lose you now
Alright, sit down and spill your heart
Let's start from the very start
'Cause I can see by your eyes
You're wasted
Your energy comes and goes
You taking your time, you know
Nothing can change what happened
So, back to the start now
I wont let you go this way now
Honesty is what you need
It sets you free like someone to save you
Let it go but hurry now
There's undertow and I don't wanna lose you now
Don't wanna lose you now, now
Oh, my, look at your bright stars fade so
How much can you take?
Honesty is what you need
It sets you free like someone to save you
Let it go but hurry now
There's undertow and I don't wanna lose you
Someone to save you
Someone to save you
Someone to save you
Save you, save you
Someone to save you
What you need is
Someone to save you
