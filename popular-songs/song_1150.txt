Friday night and the moon is high
I'm wide-awake just watchin' you sleep
And I promise you you're gonna have
More than just the things that you need
We ain't got much now
We're just startin' out
But I know somehow
Paradise is comin'
Someday baby
You and I are gonna be the ones
And good luck's gonna shine
Someday baby
You and I are gonna be the ones
So hold on
We're headed for a better life
Oh now there's a place for you and me
Where we can dream as big as the sky
I know it's hard to see it now
But baby someday we're gonna fly
This road we're on
You know it might be long
But my faith is strong
It's all that really matters
Someday baby
You and I are gonna be the ones
And good luck's gonna shine
Someday baby
You and I are gonna be the ones
So hold on
We're headed for a better life
So hold on, hold on
C'mon baby, hold on
Yeah, we're gonna have it all
And ooo
Someday baby
You and I are gonna be the ones
And good luck's gonna shine, yes it is
Someday baby
You and I are gonna be the ones
So hold on
Just hold on
Someday baby
You and I are gonna be the ones
And good luck's gonna shine, shine on down
Someday baby
You and I are gonna be the ones
So hold on
We're headed for a better life
Oh, a better life now
Oh, a better life, oh, ooo
Hey we're gonna leave this all behind us baby
Wait and see
We're headed for a better life
You and me
We're gonna break the chains that bind and finally
We'll be free
We're gonna be the ones that have it all
You and me
Just hold on tight now baby
