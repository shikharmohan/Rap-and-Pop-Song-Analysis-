What did I say...to him last night
I can't feel face, trynna focus but my mind ain't right
I remember the party, the DJ, my homies, my man and me
But the rest of it's blurry,
Something I did made my baby go away
Got the same clothes on today
That I had on yesterday
What did I do, what I say
Man I don't remember
Guess I had to much to drink
'Cause I don't remember
Aww, my car ain't outside
How the hell did I get home
Damn, did he drive me, drop me off
Got his stuff and get gone
Can't call my homies, 'cause I'm lookin'...
And I just can't find my phone
I need to talk to somebody
Something I did made my baby go away
Got the same clothes on today
That I had on yesterday
What did I do, what I say
I don't remember
Guess I had to much to drink
'Cause I don't remember
Is he gone forever, man I don't know
I just don't remember
Ohh Ooh Uhh
Wish I could playback, from beginning to the end
I think we started dancing, I kinda remember a kiss there
What a cute bartender... 
For the Remy, the Hiney, of Coke, and Gin
'Cause I'm not a drinker
Caught in the moment, my baby got away
Got the same clothes on today
That I had on yesterday
What did I do, what I say
I don't remember
Guess I had to much to drink
'Cause I don't remember
Is he gone forever, man I don't know
I just don't remember
Ooh baby, so intoxicated, had enough
Ohh, coversations, to much drinking
Having fun...What was I thinking
Just celebrating, Ohh...please forgive me
Baby I just don't remember
