Everything'll be alright again
Alright again, alright again
The heart is stronger than you think
Like it could go through anything
And even when you think it can't
It finds a way to still push on though
Sometimes you wanna to run away
Ain't got the patience for the pain
And if you don't believe it look into your heart
The beat goes on
I'm tellin' you things get better through whatever
If you fall, dust it off, don't let up
Don't you know you can go be your own miracle
You need to know!
If the mind keeps thinking you've had enough
But the heart keeps telling you 'don't give up'
Who are we to be questioning, wondering what is what?
Don't give up, through it all, just stand up
Ooh, it's like we all had better days
Problems getting all up in your face
Just because you go through it
Don't mean it gotta take control, no
You ain't gotta find no hiding place
Because the heart can beat the hate
Don't wanna let the mind keep playing you
Saying you can't go on
I'm tellin' you things get better through whatever
If you fall, dust if off, don't let up
Don't you know you can go be your own miracle
You need to know!
If the mind keeps thinking you've had enough
But the heart keeps telling you 'don't give up'
Who are we to be questioning, wondering what is what?
Don't give up, through it all, just stand up
Through it all, just stand up
You don't gotta be a prisoner in your mind
If you fall, dust it off, you can live your life
Yeah, let your heart be your guide
Yeah yeah yeah
You will know there's a good if you trust the good
Everything will be alright, yeah
Light up the dark, if you follow your heart
And it will get better through whatever
If the mind keeps thinking you've had enough
But the heart keeps telling you 'don't give up'
Who are we to be questioning, wondering what is what?
Don't give up, through it all, just stand up
If the mind keeps thinking you've had enough
But the heart keeps telling you 'don't give up'
Who are we to be questioning, wondering what is what?
Don't give up, through it all, just stand up
You got it in you, find it within
You got in now, find it within now
You got in you, find it within
You got in now, find it within now
You got in you, find it within
You got in now, find it within now
Find it within you, find it within
Through it all, just stand up
