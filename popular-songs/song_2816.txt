Well I can wash out 44 pairs of socks
And have 'em on the line
You know I can starch and iron two dozen shirts
For you, can count from 1 to 9
I can slip up a great big dip up of lard from a drippings can
Throw it in the skillet, do my shopping
And be back before it melts in the pan
'Cause I'm a woman
W O M A N
Let me tell you again
I'm a woman
W O M A N
  (Woman, she's a woman)
Well I can rub and scrub till this house
Shines just like a dime
Feed the baby, grease the car and
Powder my nose at the same time
You know I can get all dressed up
Go out swinging with the M A N
Jump in bed at 5 sleep till 6
And start all over again
'Cause I'm a woman
W O M A N
Let me tell you again
I'm a woman
W O M A N
  (Woman, she's a woman)
Well now if you come to me sick you know
That I'm gonna make you well
And if you come to me all hexed up
You know I'm gonna break the spell
And if you come to me hungry, you know
I'll feed ya full of my grits
And if it's loving you want
I can kiss you and give you the shivering fits
'Cause I'm a woman
W O M A N
I'll say it again
I'm a woman
W O M A N
  (Woman, she's a woman)
Well, I got a 20 dollar gold fee says
There ain't nothing that I can't do
Well I can make a dress out of feeding sacks
And I can make a man out of you
'Cause I'm a woman
W O M A N
Let me tell you again
I'm a woman
W O M A N
  (Woman, she's a woman)
I'm a woman
(She's a woman)
Well I'm a woman
(She's a woman)
I'm a woman
(She's a woman)
Yeah I'm a woman
