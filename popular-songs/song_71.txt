If you hear music from down the street
And you find yourself tappin' your feet
Just ease on by if you want to
There's only one thing expected of you
Enjoy yourself, have a big time
Dance a little dance, drink a little wine
Come on in, the water's fine
Enjoy yourself, let it all hang out
And you'll know exactly what I'm talkin' about
If you come on over without a doubt
You'll enjoy yourself
Now you don't have to wonder what to wear
What in the world are you doin' alone over there
While we're havin a ball, just shakin' it loose
Now come on sweet baby, ain't no excuse
Enjoy yourself, have a big time
Dance a little dance, drink a little wine
Come on in, the water's fine
Enjoy yourself, let it all hang out
And you'll know exactly what I'm talkin' about
If you come on over without a doubt
You'll enjoy yourself
Oh, enjoy yourself, let it all hang out
You'll know exactly what I'm talkin' about
If you come on over without a doubt
You'll enjoy yourself
So come on over, you gonna really help out
And you'll enjoy yourself
