(jerry holland, paul evans)
I always loved my baby
I always kiss my baby
I's always taken by his charms
I never hurt my baby
I never beat my baby
I never did him any harm but
Chorus:
That dog she stole my baby
She rock and rolled my baby
Swept him away from me by storm
She came on like lightning
Stole all my thunder
Took my sunshine away
She came on like lightning
Stole all my thunder
Took my sweet sunshine away
I learned a lover's lesson
No time for second guessing
When I fall under some man's spell
I don't care if he's taken
It won't be my heart breaking
Some other fool be crying well
Repeat chorus x3
