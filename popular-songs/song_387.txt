You can cry, cry, cry like the rain
Ocean full of tears won't drown the pain
Take all your whiskey, pour it down the drain
Ain't nothin' gonna make you feel better
Ooh, she's a little heartwrecker
Ooh, she's a little heartwrecker
You can beg, beg, beg like a dog
Chase her 'round the world but she'd still be gone
She did you right once but left you all wrong
Now you're chewin' on a Dear John letter
Ooh, she's a little heartwrecker
She takes a big black ball
And a long strong chain
And she lets it fall
Again and again and again and again and again
She's a little heartwrecker
Sing, sing, sing a sad song
Honky tonk jukebox playin' along
Until your last buddy and your money's gone
But still you can't not remember
So you pray, pray, pray like a saint
Promise your Maker all kinds of things
He don't answer but you know He'd say
Son you better just forget her
Ooh, she's a little heartwrecker
She takes a big black ball
And a long strong chain
And she lets it fall
Again and again and again and again and again
She's a little heartwrecker
She was a sweet, sweet, sweeter than wine
Never knew nothin' could be so fine
So you took it all out and laid it on the line
Best you ever had only better
Ooh, she's a little heartwrecker
Ooh, she's a little heartwrecker
Ooh, she's a little heartwrecker
