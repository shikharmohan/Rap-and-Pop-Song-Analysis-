Chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back, swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlight
It's got me reminiscin' on the good times
Turnin' off of real life drive and that's right
We hittin' easy street on mud tires
Back in the day, pots farm was the place to go
We would load the truck up, hit the dirt road
Jump the barbwire and spread the word
Light the bonfire then call the girls
King in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack and gin were the few good men
Learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue
All this small town, he said, she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread?
Like I know somethin' you all don't know
Man, this shit is gettin' old
Better mind your business so watch your mouth
'Fore I have to knock your loud ass out
I'm tired of talkin', ya'll ain't listenin'
Them old dirt roads is what you all missin'
Chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back, swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlight
It's got me reminiscin' on the good times
Turnin' off of real life drive and that's right
We hittin' easy street on mud tires
See I sit back, think about them good old days
The way we was raised and our southern ways
Yeah, we like cornbread and biscuits
And if it's broke 'round here, we fix it
I can take ya'll where you need to go
Down to my hood, back in them woods
We do it different 'round here, that's right
But we sure do it good and we do it all night
If you really wanna know how it feels
To get off the road in a truck with four wheels
Jump on in, tell your friends
We'll be raisin' hell where the black top ends
We're chillin' on a back road
We're laid back, swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' on the console
And memory lane up in the headlight
Reminiscin' on the good times
We're turnin' off of real life drive and that's right
We hittin' easy street on mud tires
That's right
I was brought up in a small town up in North Georgia
Raised on Southern Baptist morals
In a front row pew for the Sunday roll call
Everybody praise the Lord, ya'll
I grew up, learned how to hunt and fish
Bust a 12 gauge pump and not miss
A life without work, that's just a myth
Never listen when they talkin' shit
My dad taught me how to stand my ground
Be a man, boy, never back down
Don't start up somethin' by talkin' trash
Better throw the first punch and whip his ass
Be somebody, make a name for yourself
Life's hard just goin' through hell
There comes a time when you've got to slow down
That's what we're doin' now
We're chillin' on
Laid back
Smoke
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on the good times
I'm turnin' off of real life drive and that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires
Let's ride, let's ride, let's ride, let's ride
Let's ride, let's ride, let's ride, let's ride
Let's ride, let's ride, let's ride
Let's ride, let's ride, let's ride
