And girl, I've made a name everybody writes off
An open-road hard case, a honky tonk lost cause
The fate I'm lookin' at, there ain't no way around
A long and lonely path, I'm destined to go down
Yeah, there ain't much of nothin' in me
Left to be saved but baby, I bet
If you could love somebody like me
There might be hope for me yet
A hope for me yet
Always livin' fast, only thinkin' short term
I never could get past a bridge I didn't burn
I'm just a worn out pair of boots
And a beat-up old guitar
A handful of country tunes
And a hard-luck kind of heart
Yeah, there ain't much of nothin' in me
Left to be saved but baby, I bet
If you could love somebody like me
There might be hope for me yet
Girl, you just might be
That outside chance for me
Yeah, you're the one good shot
At redemption that I've got
Yeah, there ain't much of nothin' in me
Left to be saved but baby, I bet
If you could love somebody like me
There might be
Yeah, there ain't much of nothin' in me
Left to be saved but baby, I bet
If you could love somebody like me
There might be hope for me yet
A hope for me yet, there's hope for me yet
