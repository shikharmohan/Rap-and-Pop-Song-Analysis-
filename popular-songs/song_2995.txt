Funny, you can hold it in your hand
And never knew 'cause you're afraid to play
And you can feel your dreams softly slipping through your fingers
Till they're so far away
Sitting there surrounded by your many life's possessions
Feeling so much more than all the load
You realized you've learned one more of living's many lessons
Love's worth more than all you'll ever own
What I'd give if you were here beside me
We could spend forever here alone
Oh, what I'd give, what would I give, just that moment
Just everything I'll ever own
Funny, when I really had it all
I never knew 'cause I just couldn't see
The wealth I hoped to find couldn't even hold a candle
To the love you gave to me
I've taken love for granted and I've taken love for pleasure
Never taking time to understand
Now I know that loving you has been my greatest treasure
And I let it slip right through my hands
What I'd give if you were here beside me
We could spend forever here alone
Oh, what I'd give, what would I give, just that moment
Just everything I'll ever own
Just everything I'll ever own
