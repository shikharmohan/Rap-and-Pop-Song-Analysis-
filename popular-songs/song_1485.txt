Well I've been lonesome, I've been empty
I got an aching, way deep down inside
And I need someone, someone to hold me
Pull down the shade, turn out the light and love me tonight
Don't think about tomorrow, it don't matter anymore
We can turn the key and lock the world outside the door
I need you, so now, come on let go now
Kick off your shoes, turn out the light and love me tonight
Well don't you worry, we're all alone now
So let your hair down, come sit by my side
And turn off the TV, put on some music
Pull down the shade, turn out the light and love me tonight
Don't think about tomorrow, it don't matter anymore
We can turn the key and lock the world outside the door
I need you, so now, come on let go now
Kick off your shoes, turn out the light and love me tonight
I need you, so now, come on let go now
Pull down the shade, turn out the light and love me tonight
