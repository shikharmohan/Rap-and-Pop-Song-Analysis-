On a hillside in Hazzard
Sets a new double-wide
God's little acre
Your paradise
A poor boy found Heaven
With a good country girl
He had all he wanted
She was his whole world
But working the coal mine
Can wear a man down
He started spending
Too much time in town
He found temptation
Fell under it's spell
And Hillbilly Heaven
Went to Honky Tonk Hell
From Hillbilly Heaven
To Honky Tonk Hell
From a warm home fire burning
To a cold, cheap motel
And an angel is crying
'Cause her good man fell
From Hillbilly Heaven
To Honky Tonk Hell
Somewhere in Hazzard
On a dark, dead-end street
Where whiskey and heartache
And old memories meet
He looks for salvation
In a bottle each night
And just goes on livin'
Though he's lost his life
Now, there's a job in the coal mine
That needs to be filled
And a heartache in Hazzard
That won't ever heal
He had it all
Now, it's all for sale
And Hillbilly Heaven's
Gone to Honky Tonk Hell
From Hillbilly Heaven
To Honky Tonk Hell
From a warm home fire burning
To a cold, cheap motel
And an angel is crying
'Cause her good man fell
From Hillbilly Heaven
To Honky Tonk Hell
He's gone from Hillbilly Heaven
To Honky Tonk Hell
