[In backwards:]
Some might call me uh paranoid
But I think I would just say that I was very aware of my surroundings!
[Verse 1]
Retrogression
Lets go back to an earlier state
Back when a bunch of cats was jumping to this world via hate
Gangbang shit, yeah I'm guilty of it
When I'm looking at the TV, man seem like everybody really love it
Wave they flags high, for the world to see
Even though we know we don't want our son and little girls to be
Nothing like we were, some of these youngsters got no thumbers
Bet they want no funk, but they could get shook up like a seizure
If bangin' retrogresses, now the color's no longer measures
Stresses of rival, says get weapon, go get the Tec, and press it
To make sure they get the message, why don't these motherfuckers
Rep and Stets know they faking just like they not afraid don't f with Texas
But still oblivious and fans see free
But real life is mo' serious than a damn TV
Like '85 they might be gunnin'
Why you living like a drummin'
When you sippin' wit' your woman
I can feel the trippin' comin'
[Chorus]
When they all talking loud
Feelin' proud cause no one is gunnin'
Ey, I can feel the trippin' comin'
Yeah, I can feel the trippin' comin'
Yo, I can feel it comin'
When I'm down for the town
And the club beefing with the woman
Ey, I can feel the trippin' comin'
Yeah, I can feel the trippin' comin'
Yo, I can feel it comin'
[Verse 2]
They was family, used to love you
Swear to God that they would never put nothing above you
It's just to, see your successes, then 'bout plug you
Put slugs to, cause they ain't with you so now it's fuck you
I get so much love, I get to searching
For the evil cuz is coming, I can see right through the curtain
But the haters fill with anger, I can feel it's about to worsen
The bigger that I get, I can feel these tricks is stake for certain
When I'm partying without my bodyguardians, I'm hardly and chill mo'
Cuz I'm feelin they wanna scar me and feel those
Tips with lead and head it to kill foes
They real hoes plus they fake fuckers like dildos
Envy can equal murder, she love when they prefered her
Heard her servers, picks alert us, quick with the squirt her
Like '85 they might be gunnin'
Why you living like a drummin'
So you steppin' with your woman
I can feel the trippin' comin'
[Chorus]
When they all talking loud
Feelin' proud cause no one is gunnin'
Ey, I can feel the trippin' comin'
Yeah, I can feel the trippin' comin'
Yo, I can feel it comin'
When I'm down for the town
And the club beefing with the woman
Ey, I can feel the trippin' comin'
Yeah, I can feel the trippin' comin'
Yo, I can feel it comin'
[Verse 3]
Why do I see mayhem?
Cuz when I watch the news I say damn
Everybody living in they last days
Are in hate and waste and
Innocent children, evil it feels the nation
Facin, life sentences are the case man
It's just too good to be true
Or maybe not huh?
Buried in the hood could be you
Cuz you got some
Extra, but next bra, ain't lookin for no kinda lecture
When you sittin on something better, gotta be alert
Or you off in a stretcha
When I'm 'sposed to be here in fun
I'm standing near a gun
Cuz I ain't gotta have no demons
Scheming on me, tryin to tear a lung
I'm just a real one
I keep my eyes open for the bullshit
Never am I clueless
I'm looking every direction
Everywhere he comes
From
[In backwards:]
No matter how big I get, or how much money I make
The seepage will always find a way
[Chorus]
When they all talking loud
Feelin' proud cause no one is gunnin'
Ey, I can feel the trippin' comin'
Yeah, I can feel the trippin' comin'
Yo, I can feel it comin'
When I'm down for the town
And the club beefing with the woman
Ey, I can feel the trippin' comin'
Yeah, I can feel the trippin' comin'
Yo, I can feel it comin'
