When you ain't got nobody
Then nobody ever says goodbye
You don't have to wait for someone
To make you laugh or make you cry
Wish I were only lonely
Just kind of ordinary blue
If I were only lonely
Then maybe I'd know what to do
But I'm helpless 'cause I'm lonely for you
I sleep in a bed so empty
It's an emptiness no one can fill
I may have to go on living
But life without you ain't no thrill
Wish I were only lonely
Just kind of ordinary blue
If I were only lonely
Then maybe I'd know what to do
But I'm helpless 'cause I'm lonely for you
Well, whoever said it's better
To love and to lose
He ought to be right here in my shoes
Wish I were only lonely
Just kind of ordinary blue
If I were only lonely
Then maybe I'd know what to do
But I'm helpless 'cause I'm lonely for you, woo
