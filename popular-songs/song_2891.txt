Sun goes down on a silky day
Quarter moon walking though the Milky Way
Oh, you and me baby
We could think of something to do
It's the right time of the night
The stars are waking above
It's the right time of the night for making love
No use talking when the shadows fall
Night bird's calling and he says it all
Oh, you and me baby
We could think of something to do
It's the right time of the night
The stars are waking above
It's the right time of the night for making love
I got you and you got me
Tell you that's the way my mama
Always said it should be
Oh, I'll be good and you be kind
We'll be bad if you don't mind
It's the right time of the night
The stars are waking above
It's the right time of the night for making love
It's the right time of the night
The stars are waking above
It's the right time of the night for making love
It's the right time of the night
The stars are waking above
It's the right time of the night for making love
