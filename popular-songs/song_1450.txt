Well, I've been lost in this town
Even though I know my way around
Didn't take me long until I found the devil
With just one word I knew his voice
Is the one I heard in every choice
I made just trying to be a rebel
In a small town, in a small town
If you jumped off of our front porch
You'd land right where the Civil War was fought
And it's never been forgotten
It's twenty miles to the interstate
There's a Burger King and a Motel 8
And the only thing 'tween here and there is cotton
Jeffrey prays to Jesus asking Him please
Just help us through one more day
Jenny gets high, she wastes her life, but me I just ran away
From a small town, from a small town
Sometimes it was heaven, sometimes hell
Kinda like church, kinda like jail
There's a water tower says, 'Welcome to nowhere'
As soon as I could I was long gone
My jeans were torn and my hair was long
Now I can't believe I wanna go back there
To a small town, to a small town
Jeffrey prays to Jesus asking Him please
Just help us through one more day
Jenny gets high, she wastes her life
But me I just ran away but I knew I'd come back some day
To a small town, to a small town
Oh to a small town, to a small town
Oh to a small town
