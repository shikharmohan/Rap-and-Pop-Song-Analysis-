It's getting to the point we're not even listening anymore
We're just walking 'round in circles and wearing holes out in the floor
And I'm tired; I know you're tired and it's late,
Yeah it's almost four.
What are we trying to achieve, baby?
What are we trying to win?
I said the same thing three hours ago,
And now I'm saying it again.
And I know you and I well enough to know,
Neither one of us is giving in!
[Chorus:]
Well baby, I love you I'm not going to bed angry,
And baby, I need you, I want you to be happy,
We've been going around in circles with no end in sight!
Maybe we should just...
Shut off the lights,
And wait till the morning!
Shut off the lights,
Wait till the morning!
It's amazing all the old wounds we still carry around,
We wait to bring it all up when it all comes down.
Like it's coming right now!
[Chorus:]
And baby, I love you; I'm not going, baby,
Baby, I need you, I want you to be happy,
We've been going around in circles with nowhere to stop!
Baby if we just...
Shut off the lights,
And wait till the morning!
Shut off the lights,
Wait till the morning!
Cause I don't wanna lose you,
And I don't wanna hate you,
I don't wanna feel like a...
[Chorus:]
