Baby listen, I don't want to have to call you a bitch
Every time you see another woman, pitiful bitch
But you can bet ima do it if you act a witch
Better change before I get into some gangsta shit
Checkin my clothes for N-O's
You think im all up in dem hoes
Who love to be givin me demos
All up in my grill
Baby what kinda nigga you think I am?
You makin a villian say goddamn!
In the middle of a conflict with your nonsense
I read you like a book
Where the calm went?
And quite frankly bitch I dont like your content
If it aint she say then its he say and he game
Who gives a damn about a he say, she say Saint Jones replay
9 millimeter heat day
Never woulda hit it if I knew this
Every time I gotta come home to this
Why you wanna do this?
Never gave it to a celeberty
Better be down with a nigga wit a early 70's mindframe
Id rather be behind you hittin it doggy style
You all about mind games
Mrs. Sherlock always tryin to find things
Sluts, is a wonderful thing
So hard you get spine pains
But you gotta know im the nigga in they dream
They wanna interviene
But they know they come at me they gotta terrible scene
Your friends say im a player
My reply, yous a motherfuckin liar
'causez I was up in the hotel all in the jiggamapie
They said I had a chick in the buns with the K-Y
Gettin high
I didnt lie!
