Did you see me with my coat and my white t-shirt
And my cowboy boots, and my baby blues
Staring at you from across the room?
Did you see me looking at you? Yes, you did
I was looking at your eyes, looking at your legs
Looking at your thigh, looking at the old back side
Did you see me looking at you, man?
I don't understand what a women like you
Would want in a boy like him, and boy like him
Well, I saw your man standing there and I gave him a glare
And I swear he looked pretty scared to me
I saw him swallow his pride and I looked deep in his eyes
And it ended with, "You wanna take this outside?"
'Cause Carolina boys get rowd and loud
Yes, we do, don't look at me
I'll turn you whole world upside down
'Cause we get rowd and loud
I didn't mean to scare you with my rowdy redneck friends
But I couldn't help to notice you walk in with him
His 3 piece suit and his penny loafer shoes
Girl, tell me what am I gonna do with you?
Do you want to ride?
Do you want to dance all night?
Do you want to take a little
Trip in my lifted ride?
It might get rowd and loud
Now tell the truth, girl, you saw a new world
The moment you layed your pretty little eyes on me
Well, I give you something to think about, something to talk about
Tell the whole world about a girl like me
'Cause Carolina boys get rowd and loud
Yes, we do, don't look at me
I'll turn you whole world upside down
'Cause we get rowd and loud
'Cause we get rowdy
No, we get rowdy
We get rowd and loud
