That old picture with my arm around you
Tore it to pieces this morning at two, score one for me
I took your portrait off the living room wall
Then I started on the ones in the hall, I had a bonfire
I decided it was time to forget, so I got rid of every picture you left
But what do I do with this picture of you in my mind
I close my eyes and I still see you saying goodbye
I know I'd be okay if I could just throw away this picture
I walk alone down a crowded street
And see your face in everybody I meet when's it gonna end
Every single night I crawl into bed
Hoping sleep will keep you out of my head, I should know better
Every time I turn around there you are
I never thought your memory would go this far
But what do I do with this picture of you in my mind
I close my eyes and I still see you saying goodbye
I know I'd be okay if I could just throw away
What do I do with this picture of you in my mind
I close my eyes and I still see you saying goodbye
I know I'd be okay if I could just throw away
Tell me what do I do with this picture of you in my mind
I close my eyes and I still see you saying goodbye
What do I do with this picture of you in my mind
