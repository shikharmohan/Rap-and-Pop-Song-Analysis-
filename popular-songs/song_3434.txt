I think something's broken
Then again nothin's smokin'
Or shakin' or chokin' like my old truck
But I think something's broken
And I think it's worth nothin'
It started about the time
She got all packed up
Could be my ego, could be my pride
Could be my calm cool collected side
Or maybe be my heart's comin' eye to eye
With the truth, she wasn't jokin'
I think something's broken
'Cause I just been layin' 'round hopin'
That maybe any moment, I'll get on track
I think something's broken
All locked up and frozen
'Cause I can't go forward
And I sure can't go back
Could be my ego, could be my pride
Could be my calm cool collected side
Or maybe be my heart's comin' eye to eye
With the truth
I think it's my heart comin' eye to eye
With the truth, she wasn't jokin'
I know something's broken
So I just started smokin'
And shakin' and chokin'
Like my old truck
