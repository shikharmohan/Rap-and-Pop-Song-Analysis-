Disappear
I remember the first time but it wasn't the last time
That you told me that you'd take me back so I'm still wonderin'
Why it was ever a question, I should've learned my lesson
I keep comin' back like a heart attack that's always breakin'
I can't let you vanish
There's no magic when you're gone
You say you don't need me, you say it's time to leave me
I'm not gonna let you disappear
I don't wanna hear it, I don't wanna believe it
I'm not gonna let you disappear
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Disappear
I don't wanna be lonely but you were always the only one who cast a spell
And made it feel like all of this was real
Nothin' but an illusion but I'm not gonna lose ya
So just do your trick and make it quick 'cause I'm pretendin'
I can't let you vanish
There's no magic when you're gone
You say you don't need me, you say it's time to leave me
I'm not gonna let you disappear
I don't wanna hear it, I don't wanna believe it
I'm not gonna let you disappear
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Disappear
Don't go
I can't let you vanish
There's no magic when you're gone
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Disappear
You say you don't need me, you say it's time to leave me
I'm not gonna let you disappear
I don't wanna hear it, I don't wanna believe it
I'm not gonna let you disappear
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Disappear
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Disappear
Don't go
Disappear
