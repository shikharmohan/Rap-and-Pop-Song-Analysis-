I should have took you dancing
A little candlelight romancing with roses
But I was high up on a barstool
Yeah, I was such a blind fool, now I know it
You won't believe how much I've changed since you left
It took losing you for me to find myself
Oh, I wish that you could see me
Steady hands without the whiskey, you'd be so proud
Got that job down at the factory
A brand new suit for Sunday and I'm in church now
It's been one year since I sat behind a bar
I went by the junkyard, and they've still got our car
I still see you on your knees, begging me not to drive
But I took away the keys and made you climb inside
And I'd take your place in this field of stone if I only had the power
Look what it took for me to finally bring you flowers
Lord, I'd take your place in this field of stone if I only had the power
Look what it took for me to finally bring you flowers
Yeah, look what it took for me to finally bring you flowers
