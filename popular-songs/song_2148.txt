I can't hide, noOn the mantleI'm not sadTilling that hoe
It's the seasonI'm all reasonI have seenAll I have grown
Sheared at the seamsCheat on meAnd not seenCheat on meAt the seams
I'm a lenderI'm a planterI put somethingIn the garden
In the handleOn the mantleI'm not SantaI'm not God
I want a ladyCan you save me?It's the sulfurI have grownTis the seasonI'm all reasonI have fleasAll I have hoed
