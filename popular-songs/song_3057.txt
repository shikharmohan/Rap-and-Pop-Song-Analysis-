If Cupid Had A Heart 
He Would Make You Fall 
You'd Fall In Love With Me 
In No Time At All 
If Cupid Had A Heart 
He Would Hear My Call 
I Want Him To Know 
I'm Wanting You So 
Isn't Crazy, I'm Crazy For You 
Temprature Rising, And Losing My Cool 
Only One Problem, To You I'm A Friend 
How Do I Tell You You're My Perfect Ten 
I Have Searched The Skies Above 
Even Tried The God Of Love 
But He's Yet To Hook Me Up With You 
If Cupid Had A Heart 
He Would Make You Fall 
You'd Fall In Love With Me 
In No Time At All 
If Cupid Had A Heart 
He Would Hear My Call 
I Want Him To Know 
I'm Wanting You So 
If Cupid Had A Heart 
He Would Surely Throw 
An Arrow Through Your Soul 
Better Aim And Go 
If Cupid Had A Heart 
You'd Be Mine I Know 
I Need You To See 
I Need You With Me 
Can't Ya See Baby Or Are You So Blind 
Ever Since Day One Its You On My Mind 
In A Weak Moment I Lost My Defences 
Ever Since You Boy I Found All My Senses 
One Way Love Can Take A Ride 
Say You Want Me By Your Side 
Night & Day & Night I Think Of You 
If Cupid Had A Heart 
He Would Make You Fall 
You'd Fall In Love With Me 
In No Time At All 
If Cupid Had A Heart 
He Would Hear My Call 
I Want Him To Know 
I'm Wanting You So 
If Cupid Had A Heart 
He Would Surely Throw 
An Arrow Through Your Soul 
Better Aim And Go 
If Cupid Had A Heart 
You'd Be Mine I Know 
I Need You To See 
I Need You With Me 
I Could Be So Good For You 
I Could Be Your Heaven To 
If We'd Only Cross The Line 
Where I'm Yours And You Are Mine 
I Will Love You All The Way 
Forever & A Day 
Dont Ya Know Woh oo woh 
If Cupid Had A Heart 
He Would Make You Fall 
You'd Fall In Love With Me 
In No Time At All 
If Cupid Had A Heart 
He Would Hear My Call 
I Want Him To Know 
I'm Wanting You So 
If Cupid Had A Heart 
He Would Surely Throw 
An Arrow Through Your Soul 
Better Aim And Go 
If Cupid Had A Heart 
You'd Be Mine I Know 
I Need You To See 
I Need You With Me
