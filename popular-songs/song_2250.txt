Ah, the itchy flakes, it is a flaming
All the gels and creams, it is pertaining
To a fungus mold is my injection
Hope it's only a, a yeast infection
Oh, well it hurts when I
It hurts when I pee
Oh, well it hurts when I
It hurts when I see
Now I vomit cum and diarrhea
On the tile floor like oatmeal pizza
Fill my toilet bowl full of a cloudy puss
I feel the blood becoming chowder rust
Oh, well it hurts when I
It hurts when I pee
Oh, well it hurts when I
It hurts when I see
Roll into my bed which does consist of
Lice, bugs and fleas and yellow mucus
Stained dirt, Vaseline, toe jam and boogers
Stomach acid worms that dance in sugared sludge
