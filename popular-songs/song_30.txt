Im smokin loudly, i woke them all
I pick up that tree, when its not far
Im gone off that tree, when its not tall
Im in love with tree, i'm a avatar
I pick up a o from my nigga ralphie
my bro and me but he is not alfie
gone off that goo punch, it makes me drowsy
roll up the windows, it makes it cloudy
daaamn if you aint know
i make these girls nice smokin paper and bows
my ladies like blunts, hit em twice if not once
then i blow em off and just pass em to my bro
now catch me gettin brain if a nigga not learnin
i be spendin money if a nigga not earnin
catch me in the back seat if im not stirrin
and i be rollin up if a nigga not burnin
I got 5 on it
(Got it good)
Grab your fo', let's get keyed
I got 5 on it
Messin' with that endo weed
I got 5 on it
(Got it good)
It's got me stuck, cannot go back
I got 5 on it
Potnah, let's go half on a sack
you know a nigga like to stay up at that cruisin altitude up in the sky
try to fuck with paper planes but its not the same high
cleveland niggas aint no bitches we prefer the cigarello smoke
if you say it take away from taste then get some better smoke
cuz the shit i blow can be smoked on the next block
aint no middle man everything you need is in stock
this glock is all the security i need
i be solo dolo when you see me blowin on some weed
why speed? no need i be just takin it slow
i be so clean diesel overpowers my cologne
now all the bad bitches who blaze are shiftin this way
yall just some white doves with these leaves i am the sensei
now bow to the bag, never save the best for last
when I come around niggas know to hurry up and pass
fuck a dime set lets cop a quarter pound
what the fuck is you gonna put down
