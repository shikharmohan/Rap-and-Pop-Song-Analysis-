I drank til I stumbled, I drank til I fell
When the drunk part was over it hurt me like hell
I know about drinkin, so I know one thing's true
Being drunk is a lot like lovin' you
Cause I loved til I stumbled, I loved til I fell
When the lovin was over it hurt me like hell
Now I know what a taste of the wrong love can do
Being drunk is a lot like lovin' you
And I've woke up some mornings and sworn off the drink
At that I've done reasonably well I think
But I haven't done well swearing off you and me
At that I failed miserably
Well I felt the hangover of lovin all night
I sat at the bar all alone in a fight
I've bottled up feelings, and poured 'em out too
Being drunk is a lot like lovin' you
And I've woke up some mornings and sworn off the drink
And at that I've done reasonably well I think
But I haven't done well swearing off you and me
At that I failed miserably
Well I drank til I stumbled, I loved til I fell
When the drunk part was over love hurt me like hell
I know about drinkin, so I know one thing's true
Being drunk is a lot like lovin' you
Though I know what a taste of the wrong love can do,
Sometimes I still get drunk lovin you
