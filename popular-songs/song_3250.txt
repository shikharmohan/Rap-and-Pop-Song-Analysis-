What!
This is dedicated to the young gang niggas on 56th and
Highland
Nigga
Get yo money fool, yeah
Dont ever let them niggas tell you that they better
than you money
Its all delicious, like this
Till you walk these shoes
You couldn't understand my views
While you on your Caribbean cruise
I'm payin my dues
On the corner tryin to hit licks for slips
Trouble making them flips
So I'm bout to smoke a dipped
Now I'm ripped
How could you make a hypothesis on me and my partnas 
With your college degree trying to psycho-analyze me
You can't see what I see
You can't be what I be
When I'm deep in this pit of violence
Without parental guidance, nigga
Spot, translation cops watching me every day when I'm
just holding down my block
Fuck a ad hoc
My brother, My fathers' in jail
So I'm bout to make a sell
Momma fell
What the hell
Gotta get that rel
Then I bail
I smell like sherman
You can tell
The chemically it got me wanted to use my genitally
On this bitch, that bitch
The kind that don't want to bust a gang
Aint got no rub, so I'ma just hit it and hope she
don't give me whats his name
Packs
Need one in case of emergencies
Urgencies
Bills I'm trying to hug
Still you trying to judge
Yelling I'll be better in prison
Boozy nigga you can cruise
Till you walk these shoes, I'm Living
[Chorus 4X]
In the ghetto, packs me metal
Pump this leado, take the neiro
(Tech N9ne)
You're on the outside looking in my friend
I mean my foe
Come close and I'll be forced to let you know(what)
I'm living the life of a hustla
'cause the school system cut my visits down to zero just
for beating down a busta(its a musta)
Keep lookin at me like I'ma steal your wittnauer
And all you think I do is eat shit and shower
I'm a survivor
Present day McGyver
Two sider
You depriver
When you look at me you think I'm a conniver
Whasappening
Breakin you and your boy in a game of tennis
I'm a menace
You one of them people step into our sneakers a
minute(nigga)
You hopped out the boots
Yelling when you see its hard finding work
Being a class A felon
Drug selling
Scrapping niggas from every side
Fighting family drunk and high
Aint no punk and I'm
Domestic so I'm off to the penal again
So momma tell me how am I to reconcile again
Til you walk these
Catch me in the smokers LeSabre
Running spock off on the block
Can't understand my behavior
I'm coocoo for cocoa
Selling but driven
So muther fucker you can cruise 
Till you walk these shoes, I'm living
[Chorus 4X]
In the ghetto, packs me metal
Pump this leado, take the neiro
Till you walk these
Only speak about what you know
Till you walk these
Our record use these views to the floor
Till you walk these
Pick a punk to verbally abuse
If you walk these
You couldn't walk a block in my shoes
Till you walk these
Dont preach to every nigga you choose
Till you walk these shoes
You couldn't understand my views
Wouldn't kiss me on your shoes if they were given 
Motherfucker
You can cruise till you walk these shoes, I'm living
[Chorus 4X]
In the ghetto, packs me metal
Pump this leado, take the neiro
