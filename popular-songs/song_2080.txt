Dadadu, dadadu, dadadu
42nd Street, 4am
I'm rolling slowly, no destination in mind
Driver looking at me, strange 'cause I got in
(In)
Handed him a lot of cash
Sat back and told him, "Just drive"
(Drive)
I'm thinkin' 'bout the day
You packed your things and left
Sayin' you knew all about
Chanel, Tiffany, Tracy, Stephanie
You went away
So I'm writing in the fog
Upon the window to express myself
And how I'm feelin'
Y, L, E, N, O, L
As I roll past you in this taxi cab
If you care at all, that means I'm lonely
(Lone)
Y, L, E, N, O, L
As I roll past you in this taxi cab
If you care at all, that means I'm lonely
I see a woman walking with her man
(Man)
Man with his woman smiling
As they stroll into this little bar
(Bar)
As they kiss each other holding hands
I get sick to my stomach, so jealous
Of how fucking happy they are, lucky bastards
There's a couple different people I could call right now
But the one I'm wanting, don't want me at all right now
And that hurts through my heart
My mind and my soul
(Soul)
Rolling in this cab
Writing on the window singing Y
Y, L, E, N, O, L
(Y, Y)
As I roll past you in this taxi cab
If you care at all
(What it means is I'm)
That means I'm lonely
(Lonely)
Y, L, E, N, O, L
(O, L, O, L)
As I roll past you in this taxi cab
(In this taxi cab)
If you care at all
(If you care at all)
That means I'm lonely
What am I supposed to do now?
Rolling round, feeling like a fool now
(Ha ha hoo)
Cryin' like a bitch in the back of this taxi cab
So used to it
(Ha ha hoo)
Driver tries to ask if I'm alright
I say, "Never mind, mind your business
And just drive dammit"
(Ha ha hoo)
You don't know nothing about
How I feel right now, let me spell it out
(Y)
Y, L, E, N, O, L
(O, L)
As I roll past you in this taxi cab
(Past you in this taxi cab)
If you care at all, that means I'm lonely
(Means I'm lonely, means I'm lonely baby)
(Ohh)
Y, L, E, N, O, L
(O, L)
As I roll past you in this taxi cab
(Past you in this taxi cab)
If you care at all, that means I'm lonely
(Means I'm lonely, means I'm lonely baby, oh)
Y, L, E, N, O, L
(What it means, baby?)
As I roll past you in this taxi cab
(Said I'm sorry that I did you wrong)
If you care at all, that means I'm lonely
(And I'm lonely without you, I miss you, baby)
(Ohh)
Y, L, E, N, O, L
(L)
As I roll past you in this taxi cab
(Taxi cab)
If you care at all, that means I'm lonely
(That means I'm lonely baby, lonely baby, oh oh oh)
