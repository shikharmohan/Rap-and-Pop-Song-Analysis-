Hey, to the college kids no scholarships
starting your semester
unpacking your suitcases filling up your dresser
enjoy it while you got it, after that it's God bless ya
life is your professor, you know that b-tch is gon test ya
I got some sh-t I'd like to get off my chest
I spill out my soul, I spit out my stress
and can I spit out my stress?
it's the feeling in the air you bout to drop a real classic
he said Cole, "a lil birdy told me on the low you got an Illmatic
nobody touching Nas n-gga it's more like Villematic
these fayettnam tales be paying off well
what story is my audio theatre gon tell
I know my debut will ship, but is it gon sell?
I guess it's in God's hand's
I make the type of pieces that make Jesus say God damn
Thats for your non-believers
I'm the truth only time will teach ya
and f-ck the haters probably never love they momma's neither
old bitter-ass sit around in middle class homes with computers on hating on the newest song
while you was browsing I was taking out them student loans
trying to do this sh-t better than the n-ggas we grew up on
name a f-cking song I aint threw up on
talk is cheap, its like ya'll grew up in a Jewish home!
Pardon the stereotype
but ya'll giving me mixed feeling's like you married a white woman
one minute I'm over-rated, next minute I'm the saviour
you hate it before you played it, I already forgave ya
for bullsh-ttin' and the n-gga Cole spittin' it real
wrote this line on a plane got flown straight from the Ville
to Miami, where the same time last year
I was broker than you, I just wanna make that clear
cause now I'm dealing with money I've never seen before
and RnB b-tches want me, that was just dreams before
now do I give in to the temptation I'm facin'
the thought of losing a good woman keep me from chasin'
but I'm just a man, at time's the timing is wrong
plus my d-ck is like a man with a mind of it's own
but I'm trying to be strong, remind myself she ain't about sh-t
these hoes the same, all that change is the outfit
looking for chesse on some mouse sh-t
suck a n-gga, f-ck a n-gga, than go run they mouth quick
rappers took a vacation I came over the house sit
you want change, this that "between the seats in your couch" sh-t
the f-ck you thought, I lost it
all that flame on my name would get exhausted
au contraire my n-gga they all ears
sit back, enjoy the ride it's finna be a long year, yeah
it's finna be a long year, yeah
I know you feel that, the tingle in your spine don't conceal that
don't conceal that
this exactly what you thought
somebody bought the real back
