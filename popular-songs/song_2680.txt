I remember the first time I held you all night long
Well we're still here now
But where have all the years gone?
Holding you this way tonight, it's easy to see why
All this time, we held on to each other
We knew we had to be strong
All this time, through the tears and the laughter
It's still forever after all this time
In the fast movin' world, love is made and just thrown away
But we've always kept the promises that we made
Who would've thought you and me
Would still be here where we said we would be?
All this time, we held on to each other
We knew we had to be strong
All this time, through the tears and the laughter
It's still forever after all this time
All this time, we held on to each other
We knew we had to be strong
All this time through the tears and the laughter
It's still forever after all this time
It's still forever after all this time
