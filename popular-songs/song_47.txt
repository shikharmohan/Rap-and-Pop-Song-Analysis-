A woman is a mystery
A man just can't understand
Sometimes all it takes to please her
Is the touch of your hand
An' other times you gotta take it slow
An' hold her all night long
Heaven knows there's so many ways
A man can go wrong
Must be doin' somethin' right
I just heard ya sigh
Ya lean into my kiss
And close those deep blue need-you eyes
Don't know what I did
To earn a love like this
But baby I must be doin' somethin' right
Anywhere you wanna go
Baby show me the way
I'm open to suggestions
Mmm, whatever you say
Tonight's about givin' you what you want
Whatever it takes
Girl I hope I'm on the right road
Judgin' by the smile on your face
Must be doin' somethin' right
I just heard ya sigh
Ya lean into my kiss
And close those deep blue need-you eyes
Don't know what I did
To earn a love like this
But baby I must be doin' somethin' right, oh baby mmm
Don't know what I did
To earn a love like this
But baby I must be doin' somethin' right
Must be doin' somethin' right, oh yeah
Must be doin' somethin' right
Must be doin' somethin' right
(Doin' something right)
Mmm
Don't know what I did
(Don't know what I did)
Must be doin' somethin' right
Must be doin' somethin' right
