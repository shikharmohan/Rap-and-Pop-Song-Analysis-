Say goodbye to Old Man Winter
Say hello to sweet springtime
'Cause I'm coming out of hiding
I'm gonna get it right this time
After so long being frozen
It took a while to thaw me out
I spent too long not knowing
What love's supposed to be about
Now I'm finding out
It's a lot like comin' home
From a long time walking out in the snow
Then I looked at you and I knew I never knew nothing
And it broke this heart of stone
It's a lot like comin' home
Like a bird out on the harbor
That's been battered by the sea
I've been through some stormy weather
But you shot a life with me
Girl, you set me free
It's a lot like comin' home
From a long time walking out in the snow
Then I looked at you and I knew I never knew nothing
And it broke this heart of stone
It's a lot like comin' home, yeah
Girl, I looked at you and I knew I never knew nothing
And it broke this heart of stone
It's a lot like comin' home, comin' home
Feels like I'm comin' home
Comin' home, comin' home
Comin' home, comin' home
Comin' home, comin' home
Oh baby, I'm comin' home
Comin' home, comin' home
Comin' home, comin' home
Comin' home, comin' home
Comin' home, comin' home
Comin' home, comin' home
Comin' home, comin' home
