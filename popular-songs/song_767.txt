Yo, why should we break up if we keep makin' up?
I mean, let's just stay together
I know together we make this relationship
A little harder at least on ourselves
We give in, we take from each other so much
That I feel we don't need no one else
We fuss and we fight then the next day we tight
This is crazy girl, you need some help
Girl if you pull up to my window, I'ma take your order
Anythin' you want, girl, you know I get it for ya
Say you wanna be my baby, you know I gotta spoil ya
For the rest of my life, I'm ready to enjoy us
So why the hell we break up if we only make up?
I ain't gonna stop, never gotta front
You're the only one I want girl
So why the hell we break up if we only make up?
We woke with the birds into soft spoken words
That will lead you right into my arms
The perfect equation like mx + b
Equals why we are probably apart
No one on this earth feels like Miss Butterworth
There's someone I'd do anything for
It seems like you're pouring your heart away
But if you pull up to my window, I'ma take your order
Anythin' you want, girl, you know I get it for ya
Say you wanna be my baby, you know I gotta spoil ya
For the rest of my life, I'm ready to enjoy us
So why the hell we break up if we only make up?
I ain't gonna stop, never gotta front
You're the only one I want girl
So why the hell we break up if we only make up?
In the middle of the night, I'll be wonderin' why
Why you ain't right here?
Many days go by, and I ain't gonna lie
I need you right here
My baby after all call me crazy, but you're like a drug
Seems like it's daily we get back in love
Cupid in the sky 'cause girl you know I love you
And I know sometimes we struggle
You are the piece to the puzzle, come here take a ride
So won't ya pull up to my window? I'ma take your order
Anythin' you want, girl, you know I get it for ya
Say you wanna be my baby, you know I gotta spoil ya
For the rest of my life, I'm ready to enjoy us
So why the hell we break up if we only make up?
I ain't gonna stop, never gotta front
You're the only one I want girl
So why the hell we break up if we only make up?
