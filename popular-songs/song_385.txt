My daddy hated that rock 'n' roll
So I know I wasn't supposed to go
To the loud devil music show
But I wound up in the snake pit with my best friend
And when the lights came up
We both decided that we'd try our luck
At gettin' back to where the real show was
We were backstage, under-age, hangin' with the drummer
When a big dude attitude grabbed me by the collar
I looked at him and said, "It's all good, brother"
"I'm with the band, hired on as a local stage hand
The one in charge of the microphone stands"
And the lead singer told me to get the one in his dressin' room
We might even have a beer or two
Don't worry 'bout the backstage pass, man it's cool
I'm with the band, I'm with the band
I can't believe that we made it this far
Country singin', bangin' loud guitars
The biggest stages to the smallest bars
We were cold beer drinkin', what was I thinkin'?
Just the other night at the after party rockin' just right
This little country girl caught my eye
She was backstage, legal-age, hangin' with the drummer
When a big dude attitude grabbed her by the collar
I looked at him and said, "It's all good, brother"
"She's with the band, hired on as a local stage hand
The one in charge of the microphone stands"
And the lead singer told her to get the one in his dressin' room
We might even have a beer or two
Don't worry 'bout the backstage pass, man, it's cool
She's with the band
Well tomorrow is another town
But you know we love a party crowd
So if you got the right stuff we'll meet you on the bus
But you better get the lingo down
Just tell 'em that you're with the band
Hired on as a local stage hand
You know we got a lot of microphone stands
And the lead singer told you to get the one in his dressin' room
We might even have a beer or two
Don't worry about the backstage pass, y'all, it's cool
You're with the band
You're with the band
You're with the band
You're with the band
