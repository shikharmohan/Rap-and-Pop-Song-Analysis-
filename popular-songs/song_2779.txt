Jamie turned fourteen tonight
But she didn't blow out the birthday lights
Jamie and her Momma had another big fight
She locked herself in her room
She climbed up on her window seat
Sat and stared at the cars on the street
Listened to her own heart beat
And whispered to the moon
Am I the only one who cares what I do
  (Am I the only one)
'Cause if I'm the only one then who can I turn to
  (I'm the only one)
Oh moon can you tell me that it's not just me and you
Or am I the only one who cares what I do
  (Am I the only one)
The moon said Jamie can't you hear yourself
You're acting like there ain't nobody else
Come on girl take a big ole breath
You know what you gotta do
There's one more thing before I go
A woman's been standing at the window below
Searchin' for the words to let you know
How much she loves you too
And you're not the only one who cares what you do
  (You're not the only one)
And I'm not the only one that you can turn to
  (I'm not the only one)
Now Jamie please believe me
It's not just me and you
And I'm not the only one who cares
  (I'm not the only one)
She cares too
Jamie heard her Momma
Softly knocking at her door
The moon just smiled and whispered
"You'll don't need me anymore"
I'm not the only one who cares what you do
  (I'm not the only one)
And I'm not the only one who can tell the troubles too
  (I'm not the only one)
I've done the best I can
Now the rest is up to you
And I'm not the only one who cares
  (I'm not the only one)
You both care too
You both care too
