[Intro]
I know y'all don't see me on TV
Or hear me on the radio
But you industry brats
Better check Billboard and Pollstar
Before y'all get to cryin
About who get seniority at these shows
Especially when compared to me
Y'all aint shit on stage
[Hook]
I hit the stage
Grab the mic and blow 'em all away (I blow 'em all away)
(Superstars), But they know I blow 'em all away, Hey
[Verse 1]
The gig is over, The gig is over (Bitty bye-bye)
The gig is over, The gig is over (When A play)
The kid is older and gettin colder (Many fly by)
But his will hold ya, So listen closer to (A-A)-R-O-N
They dissin and twistin my name
Because Aaron is scarin these glitz spittin pricks in the game
Hit with this gift, Everybody get a whiff of this script and it's pain
Gotta talk about the people with a attitude
Hiss me and slipped in my lane
I've been wreckin crowds for a long second now
Got 'em guessin how Tech is blessed
And yes, The best in-town rep
On the real, I keep it trill
And when I spit, I aint spillin about my million
It's the feelin that you get with this underground headliner
Mainstream ignored a bro
And they be petty, So jealousy is sure to show
But they rich and got more to blow
And everything's affordable
But they gotta go before me
Because their stage show is horrible
[Hook]
I hit the stage
Grab the mic and blow 'em all away (I blow 'em all away)
(Superstars), But they know I blow 'em all away, Hey
They may be platinum
But they know I blow 'em all away (I blow 'em all away)
(Superstars), But they know I blow 'em all away, Hey
Why you do me like that girl?
You know I love your mama
[Verse 2]
I just wanted to have a bite with her... or somethin
Didn't go get up on that show to fight with her... or nothin
It was Keyshia Cole, Eric Benet, Gorilla Zoe, Tech Nina and T.I.
But Keyshia was actin Bia-Bia
Why she actin like a (what?), like a (what?)
She aint know I grab the mic and light it (up), light it (up)
She say, "She don't know me"
But I'm the number one Independent in the country
Man, She the only one actin funky
And the people at the Summer Jam, They want me
She say, "She aint goin on before somebody that's local"
And she went postal and loco
Sayin, "Her not closin, Is a no-go"
Down talked me real low though
About how she got more doe and just did a TV promo
No show better than the Mo. bro with the S & M logo
Damn baby, Much success is sittin in your favor
Slam the Nina Tech before considerin the data
Fans waited, So we went, So she'd get it for later
But Frankie said, "Excuse my daughter, She's a bit of a hater"
Dwamn!
[Hook]
I hit the stage
Grab the mic and blow 'em all away (I blow 'em all away)
(Superstars), But they know I blow 'em all away, Hey
They may be platinum
But they know I blow 'em all away (I blow 'em all away)
(Superstars), But they know I blow 'em all away, Hey
[Verse 3]
Aye, Aye, Check it
I understand seniority
But in this case, On this show, I'm a top priority
In Lawrence, Your minority and I'm the majoriry
Check it, I was young and broke
But I'd fetch it, If it was freshest
Shovel snow for the Eric B. and Rakim record
Promoters called us and said,
"We got this show and want you to close us"
Ghostface and Brother Ali, Rakim with a band, It's so tough
We couldn't wait to see Rakim rock
But he never ever showed up
He swole up cause he didn't wanna go up before us
Man, What's wrong with these people?
Think the world gotta kiss their asses
500 capacity but you wanna get 200 passes
Thought it was about gouda
40 Water told me,
"Nina, Get ya cabbage, Stay savage and ravage the average"
Y'all better hope radio and video
Keep me from slithering... into they circle
I'll change it, That's why they shivering
Rakim the God? He just miss the king's delivering
Cause they know they'll fall
And I'll blow them all to smithereens
[Hook]
I hit the stage
Grab the mic and blow 'em all away (I blow 'em all away)
(Superstars), But they know I blow 'em all away, Hey
They may be platinum
But they know I blow 'em all away (I blow 'em all away)
(Superstars), But they know I blow 'em all away, Hey
[Outro]
Real, Real spill, Yeah
Baby girl,
I know I aint the only one that know you could be bitchy
You know what I'm sizzlin?
Ol' boy,
I know I aint the only one that know you could be bitchy
Do your research before you down somebody else
Get off your high horse
Keyshia Cole, Get off your high horse
Rakim, Get off your high horse
Industry, Get off your high horse
Yeah
