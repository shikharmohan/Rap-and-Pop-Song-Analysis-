In the circles I've been running
I've covered many miles
And I could search forever
For what's right before my eyes
Just when I thought I'd found it
It was nothing like I'd planned
When I got my heart around it
It slipped right through my hands
Here with you I feel it
I close my eyes and see it
In a midnight talk, in a morning kiss
When I'm in your arms, that's where it is
When I'm tangled up and can't resist
When we feel that rush, that's where it is
That's where it is
When I'm crashing through the madness
Not sure who I'm supposed to be
When I'm caught up in the darkness
It's your hand that's leading me
You bring me back to solid ground
You lift me up right here, right now
In a midnight talk, in a morning kiss
When I'm in your arms, that's where it is
When I'm tangled up and can't resist
When we feel that rush, that's where it is
It's a life time thrill when tiding braces
The biggest things in the smallest places
In a midnight talk, in a morning kiss
When I'm in your arms, that's where it is
When I'm tangled up and can't resist
When we feel that rush, that's where it is
In the sweetest smile, on a night like this
And a tender touch, that's where it is
When I'm tangled up and can't resist
When we feel that rush, that's where it is
That's where it is
