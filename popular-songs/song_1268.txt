You're going crazy, running on empty
You can't make up your mind
You try to hide it but you had to say it
Restless all this time
So completely drained on
Everything that's in your life
It's so wrong but you had to scream
Every thought you kept inside
One minute you laugh
The next minute you're slowly
Sinking into something black
I get the feeling that lately
Nothing ever really lasts
I keep trying to get up
But I keep falling back
And you love and you hate
And you wait
'Cause one minute goes fast
You just can't escape it, you're losing patience
You wonder what went wrong
Everything changes, happy then jaded
Always a different song
Playin' in your head
Just when you think you've got it down
Out of nowhere you realize
It's different music playing now
One minute you laugh
The next minute you're slowly
Sinking into something black
I get the feeling that lately
Nothing ever really lasts
I keep trying to get up
But I keep falling back
And you love and you hate
And you wait
'Cause one minute goes fast
One minute goes fast
One minute goes fast, fast
One minute you laugh
The next minute you're slowly
Sinking into something black
I get the feeling that lately
Nothing ever really lasts
I keep trying to get up
But I keep falling back
And you love and you hate
And you wait 'cause one minute goes
One minute goes, one minute goes fast
