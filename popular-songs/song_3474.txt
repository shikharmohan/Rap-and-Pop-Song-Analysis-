I spent fifteen hundred dollars on your damn dog's collar
Put new spinners on your Escalade
I swear I almost started cryin' when you brought up buyin' diamonds
Lord, I'm spendin' more than I'm gettin' paid
You got more purses than Versace, got more rings than Liberace
Fill your closet full of fancy shoes
All my credit cards are cookin'
Girl, you don't know what you're puttin' me through
It's a business doin' pleasure
A business doin' pleasure with you
You've got me walkin' past the fellas, holdin' drinks with pink umbrellas
On some island that I can't even spell
Then we slide over to Gucci, right before we go for sushi
That's a version of my personal hell
You just spent all day long tryin' on Louis Vuitton
There's a thousand things that I'd rather do
Lord, my mom would beat me senseless
If she saw what I was spendin' on you
It's a business doin' pleasure
A business doin' pleasure with you
You're gonna break my bank before too long
I'm takin' out a loan
But when you turn your kind of lovin' on
Honey, I just can't say no
No, no, no, no, no, no
You're gonna break my bank before too long
I'm runnin' out of dough
But when you turn you kind of magic on
Honey, I just can't say no, no, no, no
Maybe I'll play the stock market, put some money in my pocket
Ain't no telling, what you're gonna need next
I need to steal a Sherman tank just to break into a bank
I pray to God this song will be a success
All my buddies think it's funny 'cause I'm spendin' all my money
On some honey like there's somethin' to prove
'Cause for a little of your lovin'
There ain't nothin' much that I wouldn't do
It's a business doin' pleasure
A business doin' pleasure with you
No, no, no, no
It's a business doin' pleasure
A business doin' pleasure with you
