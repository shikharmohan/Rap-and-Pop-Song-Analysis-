Yeah this was meant to be

[Big Sean - Verse 1]
Stack that paper
stack it stack it stack it up some more
give me everything I want then I'm asking for some more
Im smoking up on that tropical charlie green yeah jalapagos
rainbow chain on my necklace look like a pot of gold
I know these girls tryna no jumping off Jeronimo
they tell me I'm the best and I aint even trying hoe
see me I'm into hoes that's into hoes
so now I'm in two hoes, real sh-t boy
you don't drink, more for me
we chillin out with n-ggas can't afford to be
look baby girl you better act accordingly cuz I see bout 10 more of u but sorry there's no more of me
[Chorus]
[Big Sean - Verse 2]
Ca-ca-ca-catch me if you can
cuz I might go from plane to whips
cuz money is hand to hand
and I be shining neck to wrist
and your girl want mouth to mouth
and I make her get neck to d-ck
cuz she just want connections with a n-gga thats connected
b-tch, Im who they want be, want see, want see
used to tell me everything I want be
you gon be, f-cking with piranha's and they want eat
but somehow I just turn the tide like laundry
oooh, and now my life is beautiful
I'm a boss b-tch you should come and grab a cubicle
look and I remain until my funeral
stand up n-gga like I'm in front of the urinal
[Big Sean - Chorus]
