Well I went and saw my doctor today he
said son you've been eatin' the unheathly
way you should eat the four food groups
and cut back on beer
But his words must have mixed up before they reached my ears 
              (Chorus)
{Cuz im gettin serving some fruit in apple martini's 
and all my dairy comes from cold bayleys amaynays for meat I like steak
and when im good and tipsy six servings of grain comes from Jack Daniel's Whiskey}
Well ive got to say that my perscription works fine cuz i've never felt better than 
I do tonight the only side affect I have
to dread is I cant ever remember a damn word that I said
             (CHORUS)2 times
I said six servings of grain comes from Jack Daniel's Whiskey!
