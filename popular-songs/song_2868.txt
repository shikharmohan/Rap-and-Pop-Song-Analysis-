At an antique desk, an old man sits alone
It's Christmas Eve and it's almost time to go
He signs his name to a letter he just wrote
Then he reads it back with a voice as soft as snow
I want peace on earth for Christmas
In a world where there's not one hungry child
They would hope, and faith conquers fear and hate
All I'm asking for is a little more love
Then he walks outside and he climbs upon his sleigh
And calls out to his reindeer and off they fly away
Oh, tonight he'll make a million dreams appear
While he wishes that his own dreams would come true this year
I want peace on earth for Christmas
In a world where there's not one hungry child
They would hope, and faith conquers fear and hate
All I'm asking for is a little more love
That they would hope, and faith just conquers fear and hate
All I'm asking for is a little more love
