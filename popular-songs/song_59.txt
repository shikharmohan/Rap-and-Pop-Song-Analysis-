It's a gentle touch, but more than enough
She can stop this ole world from spinnin' too much
It's a natural thing and I do believe
I found my reason to be
She's got a way with me
She's got a way with me
I'm not the same man since she's been around
There's more to this life, I've suddenly found
I look at myself now so differently
It's her love that brings me peace
She's got a way with me
She's got a way with me
Whatever it is I'll always be under her spell
She'll always be all I'll ever need
I could search this whole world
I know I'd never find someone perfect as her for me
Suddenly it's something, you just can't live without
Oh, you know you found love beyond any doubt
With a simple man's words
I can never convey all that I feel when I say
She's got a way with me
(She's got a way)
She's got a way with me
(She's got a way)
She's got a way with me
(She's got a way)
She's got a way with me
She's got a way with me
(She's got a way with me)
