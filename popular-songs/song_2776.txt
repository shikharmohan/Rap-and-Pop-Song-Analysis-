Everyone I see these days still asks me about you
I guess they got so used to us together
They assume that everything's okay
And then I have to say
I wouldn't know, I haven't seen him
I couldn't say it's been awhile
I haven't thought about him lately
So I wouldn't know
I'm getting tired of people askin'
Why can't they just leave me alone
I couldn't care, I couldn't say
I wouldn't know
I don't get out anymore to our old stompin' grounds
'Cause some old friend is bound to ask me
Why you're not around
Well I just stay away so I don't have to say
I wouldn't know, I haven't seen him
I couldn't say it's been awhile
I haven't thought about him lately
So I wouldn't know
I'm getting tired of people askin'
Why can't they just leave me alone
I couldn't care, I couldn't say
I wouldn't know
