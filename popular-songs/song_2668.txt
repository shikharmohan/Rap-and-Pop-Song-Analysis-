I know that you've seen love walk out the door once or twice
I know that you've seen it all
Waiting by the telephone you didn't get the call
Well baby let me tell ya, you're looking at me
With suspicious eyes, but they'll never be confirmed
If there was someone else, I wouldn't be here now
'Cause you're the only one I want my arms around
And I'm telling you the truth and now I'll tell ya why
If there was someone else I'd be with him tonight
No time for doubts, I'm gonna turn your heart around
Think about you everyday
Gonna make you understand my love is here to stay
We've got something going that's so hard to find
You are the one, the only one that's on my mind
If there was someone else, I wouldn't be here now
'Cause you're the only one I want my arms around
And I'm telling you the truth and now I'll tell ya why
If there was someone else, I'd be with him tonight
Oh, there was someone else, I wouldn't be here now
'Cause you're the only one I want my arms around
And I'm telling you the truth and now I'll tell ya why
If there was someone else, I'd be with him tonight
