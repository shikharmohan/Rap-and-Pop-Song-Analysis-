Us living as we do, upside down,
And the new word to have is revolution.
People don't even want to hear the preachers spill or spiel,
Because god's whole card has been thoroughly piqued.
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey.
The youngsters who were programmed to continue fucking up,
Woke up one night digging Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys.
America stripped for bed and we have not all yet closed our eyes.
The signs of truth were tattooed across our open ended vagina.
We learned to our amazement, the untold tale of scandal,
Two long centuries buried in a musty vault, hosed down daily with a gagging perfume.
America was a bastard, the illegitimate daughter of the mother country whose legs were then spread around the world and a rapist known as freedom, free doom...
Democracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary code names that preceded the bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling,
In the mother country's crotch.
What does Websters say about soul?
All I want is a good home and a wife and her children,
And some food to feed them every night.
After all is said and done,
Build a new route to china if they'll have you.
Who will survive in America? [x5]
