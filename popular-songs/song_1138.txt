Don't shut me out
Maybe, baby, we should talk about it
'Cause you've got your doubts
But maybe, baby, they might be unfounded
Have a little faith, you'll make it through
I'd never hesitate to talk to you
If you tell me just what's weighin' on your mind
Maybe it could help you sleep tonight
So don't shut me out
Don't be so proud
Don't you know that before a fall it leaves you?
And it'll take you down
Baby, that ain't, where I wanna see you
The sun'll rise tomorrow come what may
And you'll feel better than you do today
And in time you'll cry no more
I know 'cause my heart's been there before
And here I am when you need someone
My shoulder's yours to cry upon
And everybody now and then
Needs an understanding friend around
So don't shut me out
Don't shut me out
Maybe, baby, we should talk about it
'Cause you've got your doubts
But maybe, baby, they might be unfounded
Listen to your heart and clear your mind
And you will find the answer every time
Every road you travel on will lead
To where it is your heart's supposed to be
And here I am when you need someone
My shoulder's yours to cry upon
And everybody now and then
Needs an understanding friend around
So don't shut me out, hmm, don't shut me out, no
