Come on and jump
Jump jump jump jump
When I say jump, you say how high
I ain't never seen nobody-ody get so high
Like a bird, like a plane, this party-arty insane
This party-arty insane, so jump jump jump jump!
Now now we gon' take it to the roofs
E'rybody with me got they own parachute
Y'ain't scared of heights when you sippin' on Goose
Party all night like I'm flyin' Jet Blue
Y'ain't never seen nobody get this loose
Shawty actin' naughty with her body, what it do
Jump to this man, bump to this man, stump to this man
Crump to this man, got another hit man
Hold up, I wanna go up, then wanna throw up
My clique pull up and every bad chick know us
Dance, the boy got us all feelin' high
Master shawty, I'm a astronaut
High rollin' baby like I'm chokin' on pot
Super Bowl blimp Goodyear on top
Could I be a bird? I gotta be fly
Butterfly and spur and I got a couple words
When I say jump, you say how high
I ain't never seen nobody-ody get so high
Like a bird, like a plane, this party-arty insane
This party-arty insane, so jump jump jump jump!
When I say jump, you say how high
I ain't never seen nobody-ody get so high
Like a bird, like a plane, this party-arty insane
This party-arty insane, so jump jump jump jump!
When the, when the, when the club jumpin' then I gotta be there
Check it out, shawty like Nike Air
Up, up and away, take it off like Nair
NBA ballin', I don't care
Now what do you do when you see you a shawty
And she make it bounce in the room?
Hey girl, come on baby, you's a fine somethin' lady
Can I get on your hot air balloons?
Sky high, still clubbin' like I'm part of the mile high
Ears poppin', Bubbalicious, help me get right
Keep poppin' in position after midnight
Moese, fly chickens up in NY
Jigga what, know the pimp war
Houston, we're gonna jump ship, all aboard
Port of Miami, women they parlay a thor'
Cali is jumpin', hit the switch on the 6-4
When I say jump, you say how high
I ain't never seen nobody-ody get so high
Like a bird, like a plane, this party-arty insane
This party-arty insane, so jump jump jump jump!
Jump jump jump
Come on and jump, jump, jump
Come on and jump, jump, jump
All my ladies
(Get down, get down, get down, down, down)
All my ladies
(Get down, get down, get down, down, down)
All the fellas
  (Jump jump jump jump jump jump jump jump)
All the fellas, the ladies, the fellas, the ladies
  (Jump jump jump jump jump jump jump jump)
Let me see you do it!
When I say jump, you say how high
I ain't never seen nobody-ody get so high
Like a bird, like a plane, this party-arty insane
This party-arty insane, so jump jump jump jump!
When I say jump, you say how high
I ain't never seen nobody-ody get so high
Like a bird, like a plane, this party-arty insane
This party-arty insane, so jump jump jump jump!
Get down, get down, get down, down, down, down
Get down, get down, get down, down, down, down
Down, down, down
