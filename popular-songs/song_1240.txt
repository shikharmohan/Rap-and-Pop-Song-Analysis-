Don't play that song for me
'Cause it brings back memories
Of the days that I once knew
And all the days that I spent with you
Oh no, don't let it play
(Oh no)
It fills my heart with pain
(It hurts)
Please stop it right away
'Cause I remember just what it said
It said darling
(Darling I)
You know that ya lied
(Darling I)
Boy, ya know that ya lied
(Darling I)
You know that ya lied, ya lied, ya lied
(Ya lied, ya lied)
I remember on our first date
You kissed me then you walked away
And I was only seventeen
And I never dreamed that he could be so mean
Oh darling
(Darlin', oh no)
Don't ya play it no more
(Play it no more)
Don't you dare play that song
(Don't play it no more)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh no, ya lie
(Ya lie, ya lie)
