Lovin' life and life is livin'
It's very special
Baby, don't go, baby, don't go
Baby, don't go, baby, don't go
It's such a shame but I'm leavin'
Can't take the way you're mistreatin' me
And it's crazy, but oh, baby
It don't matter, whatever, don't phase me
I don't believe you wanna leave like this
I don't believe I just had my last real kiss
I do believe we'll laugh and reminisce
Wait a minute, don't bounce, baby
Let's talk about this mess
Well, I'm bouncin' and I'm out, son
I gotta leave you alone
'Cause I'm good, holdin' down my spot
And I'm good, rappin' the girls on the block
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right?
All my pride is all I have
Your pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you had
You'll be needin' me but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad
The path you chose to run alone
I know you independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
The time is of the essence, why spend it alone
Some nights I waited up for you
Promises you made about comin' through
So much time you wasted
That's why I had to replace you
It makes a cat nervous, the thought of settlin' down
Especially me, I was creepin' all over town
I thought my tender touch could lock you down
I knew I had you, as cocky as it sounds
The way you used to giggle right before I put it down
It's better when you're angry come here, I'll prove it now, come here
Stop playin', you gamin'
I gotta leave you alone
'Cause I'm good, holdin' down my spot
And I'm good, rappin' the girls on the block
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right?
All my pride is all I have
Your pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you had
You'll be needin' me but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad
The path you chose to run alone
I know you independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
The time is of the essence, why spend it alone
People make mistakes to make up, to break up, to wake up
Cold and lonely chill baby you know me you love me
I'm like your homey instead of beef and confomy
I promise I'm not a phony, don't bounce baby console me, come here
Ain't nothin' you can say to me that can change my mind
I gotta let you go now
And nothin' will ever be the same, do just be on your way
Go head and do your thang now
And there`s no more to explain to me, you know
I know you game I'm not feelin' what you do
So I'm bouncin' and I'm out, son
I gotta leave you alone, yeah, yeah
All my pride is all I have
Your pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you had
You'll be needin' me but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad
The path you chose to run alone
I know you independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
The time is of the essence, why spend it alone
All my pride is all I have
Your pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you had
You'll be needin' me but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad
The path you chose to run alone
I know you independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
The time is of the essence, why spend it alone
