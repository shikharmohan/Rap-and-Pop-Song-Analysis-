Verse 1:
You're asking me to open up
I'm tryin' my best to give enough
To keep this love alive
It wouldn't be so hard for me to do
If it hadn't have been for all my heart's been through
Chorus:
But once you've learned to be lonely
And lonely is the only thing you've known
It begins to feel like home
It becomes your comfort zone
Once you've learned to be without someone
And settle for the silence of an empty room
Oh,it changes you
There's a lot you have to undo
Once you've learned to be lonely
Verse 2:
It becomes a habit of the heart
To be afraid and even start
To try and love again
I want to give you myself to you
But I've been alone so long that I'm scared
Scared to move
Chorus:
But once you've learned to be lonely
And lonely is the only thing you've known
It begins to feel like home
It becomes your comfort zone
Once you've learned to be without someone
And settle for the silence of an empty room
Oh,it changes you
There's a lot you have to undo
Once you've learned to be lonely
Pre-Chorus:
I've built walls but I feel them falling down
Touch by touch your love is my way out
Chorus:
But once you've learned to be lonely
And lonely is the only thing you've known
It begins to feel like home
It becomes your comfort zone
Once you've learned to be without someone
And settle for the silence of an empty room
Oh,it changes you
There's a lot you have to undo
Once you've learned to be lonely
There's a lot you have to undo
Once you've learned to be lonely
