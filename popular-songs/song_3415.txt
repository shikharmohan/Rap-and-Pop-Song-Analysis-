I knew a girlher name was truth
She was a horrible liar
She couldn't spend one day alone 
but she couldn't be satisfied
When you have everything
You have everything too lose
She made her self a bed of nails 
n shes planning on putting it too use
But she had diamonds on the inside 
she had diamonds on the inside
She had diamonds on the inside
diiiiiaamonds
The candle throws it light into the darkness
in a nasty word so shines a good deed
Make sure the fortune that you seek 
is the fortune that you need
So tell me why the first to ask 
is the last to give everytime
What you say and do not me 
follows you close behind
But she had diamonds on the inside 
she had diamonds on the inside
She wore diamonds on the inside
diiiiiaamonds
diiiiiaamonds
Like the soldier standing under fire
Any change comes as a relief
That the givers name remain unspoken
She is juat a genorous theif
But she had diamonds on the inside 
she had diamonds on the inside
She wore diamonds on the inside
She wore diiiiiaamonds
oh diiiiiaamonds
She had diiiiiaamonds
She wore diiiiiaamonds
diiiiiaamonds
