I ain't mad at you
Sometimes I wish I didn't love you but I'm glad I do
I ain't mad at you
Sometimes I wish I didn't love you but I'm glad I do
I ain't mad at you
Sometimes I wish I didn't love you but I'm glad I do
I shoulda known I, fall in love with your game
Guess, I had it comin'
Now, I can't escape what I'm feelin' inside
So ain't no use a runnin'
But I don't know if you feelin' me the same
You gotta tell me somethin'
'Cause I don't wanna be in love with a girl
Who's way too busy frontin'
I wanna go back to when
To where you were just a friend
No complications, not my heart racing
When I see you, baby
But it ain't the same 'cause now
I can't resist your smile
You got me buggin', I'm caught up in lovin'
And I know it's crazy but
I, I, I wish I didn't love you, I, I, I wish I didn't love you
I, I, I wish I didn't love you like I do
I, I, I wish I didn't love you, I, I, I wish I didn't love you
I, I, I wish I didn't love you like I do
Baby, sometimes I try to act like it ain't what it is
Girl I gotta face it, 'cause I
'Cause I got you all of the time that we shared
And I don't wanna waste it, yeah
You gotta hold on with dedication
So I won't even fight it
Girl, you keep a smile on my face
And I be so excited
I wanna go back to when
To where you were just a friend
No complications, not my heart racing
When I see you, baby
But it ain't the same 'cause now
I can't resist your smile
You got me buggin', I'm caught up in lovin'
And I know it's crazy but
I, I, I wish I didn't love you, I, I, I wish I didn't love you
I, I, I wish I didn't love you like I do
I, I, I wish I didn't love you, I, I, I wish I didn't love you
I, I, I wish I didn't love you like I do
Loving you is wrong, then I ain't right
'Cause I can't leave you alone
Babygirl, you have made my heart your home
It's forever you and me, so never leave
I said, if loving you is wrong, then I ain't right
'Cause I can't leave you alone
Babygirl, you have made my heart your home
It's forever you and me, so never leave, baby, yeah
I, I, I wish I didn't love you, I, I, I wish I didn't love you
I, I, I wish I didn't love you like I do
I, I, I wish I didn't love you, I, I, I wish I didn't love you
I, I, I wish I didn't love you like I do
I ain't mad at you
Sometimes I wish I didn't love you but I'm glad I do
I ain't mad at you
Sometimes I wish I didn't love you but I'm glad I do
Oh, no, no
