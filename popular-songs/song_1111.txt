To kiss and tell
It's just not my style
But the night is young
And it's been awhile
And she broke my heart
Broke it right in two
And it's fixing time
But I'm feeling like I'm finally ready to
Find, find somebody new
I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
And maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Don't wanna go too far
Just to take it slow
But I shouldn't be lonely in this big ol' world
I wanna kiss a girl
It's that moment when
You start closing in
First you're holding back
Then surrendering
It can start a fire
Light up the sky
Such a simple thing
Do you wanna try?
Are you ready to
Say goodbye
To all these blues?
I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
And maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Don't wanna go too far
Just to take it slow
But I shouldn't be lonely in this big ol' world
I wanna kiss a girl
'Cause, baby, tonight
It could turn into the rest of our lives
Oh yeah
Are you ready?
(Are you ready?)
Are you ready
(Are you ready)
To cross that line?
Put your lips on mine
Ooh, put your lips on mine, baby
Do you wanna try?
Are you ready to
Say goodbye
To all these blues?
I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
And maybe make a little magic, baby
Don't wanna go too far
Just to take it slow
Don't want you to be lonely
I shouldn't be lonely
I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
And maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Don't wanna go too far
Just to take it slow
But I shouldn't be lonely in this big ol' world
I wanna kiss a girl
I said I wanna kiss a girl
Whoa ho, whoa ho
I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
I wanna make a little magic
Out under the moonlight
Ooh I wanna kiss you now
