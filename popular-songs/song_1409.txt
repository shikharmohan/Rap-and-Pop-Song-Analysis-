Everybody thinks I've got it all
Nobody really does, do they?
I've got more than I deserve
More than I ever dreamed
But there's always a price you pay
It's been an amazing road
I've been blessed, I know
But at the end of the day, I go home alone
I still hope someday I'll have a wife and kids
Smiling faces running to the door
And when I walk in saying, "Daddy's home
You were gone too long, what'd you bring me?
Swing me, let me show you what I did"
I still dream about that look on a woman's face
That says I love you through the good
The bad, the sunshine or the rain
Sometimes I wish I had someone to share my life with
Maybe I'll have a wife and kids
Maybe someday
Maybe I could have a son
Play football in the backyard
Or take my daughter fishing and when she turns 15
I'll teach her how to drive a car
When I grow old and they've all left home
I want to lay beside my wife
And talk about the old times
Remember all the good times
I still hope someday I'll have a wife and kids
Smiling faces running to the door
And when I walk in saying, "Daddy's home
You were gone too long, what'd you bring me?
Swing me, let me show you what I did"
I still dream about that look on a woman's face
That says I love you through the good
The bad, the sunshine or the rain
Sometimes I wish I had someone to share my life with
Maybe I'll have a wife and kids
Maybe someday
Sometimes I wish I had someone to share my life with
Maybe I'll have a wife and kids
Someday, I'll have a wife and kids
Maybe someday
