Uh-Oh 5x
You walk and talk like your some new sensation
you move in circles you dont need an invitation
you spend your money you cant get no satisfaction 
you play if right so you can get the right reaction
it wont be long my darling
pick up the phone nobody's on it
where are your friends now baby?
how are the ones supposed to be there for
You
When your falling down the world starts spinning round
You
When your falling down no its not all around
You
When your falling down you know i'll be around
When your falling down (when your falling down)
Looks out of place when you look into the mirror
The truth is blurry but the lies are getting clearer
Your eyes are fixed your smile is so elastic
You gave me roses but they're all just made of plastic
it wont be long my darling
pick up the phone nobody's on it
where are your friends now baby?
how are the ones supposed to be there for
You
When your falling down the world starts spinning round
You
When your falling down no its not all around
You
When your falling down you know i'll be around
When your falling down (when your falling down)
smile for the camera everybodys looking at you
smile for the camera cause we're all about to trash ya
smile for the camera (camera camera)
smile for the camera
its gonna catch ya
You.
You
When your falling down the world starts spinning round
You
When your falling down no its not all around
You
When your falling down you know i'll be around
When your falling down (when your falling down)
Smile for the camera everybody's looking at you
Smile for the camera cause we're all about to trash ya
