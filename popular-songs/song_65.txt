Don't you hate hearin' that clock on the wall chimin', sayin' its time an'
Don't you just wish we could stay right here together all day long?
You know it wouldn't be a crime if we crawled back in the bed
Got as close as we could get
Tried to figure out where this thing is goin'
Baby, baby, don't, don't you say you're leavin'
Why don't you stay a little bit longer?
Got it goin' on and I just can't believe it
This feelin' it just keeps gettin' stronger
If you gotta go, you gotta know I might go crazy
Here without you baby, relivin' every kiss
You ain't leavin' me like this, it just ain't right
Been waitin' 'til tonight to light another flame
You know it wouldn't be the same
As the fire we got burnin' this mornin'
Baby, baby, don't, don't you say you're leavin'
Why don't you stay a little bit longer?
Got it goin' on and I just can't believe it
This feelin' it just keeps gettin' stronger
No, no one else can love me like you do
You know I ain't even close to through lovin' you
Baby, baby, don't, don't you say you're leavin'
Why don't you stay a little bit longer?
Got it goin' on and I just can't believe it
This feelin' it just keeps gettin' stronger
Don't!
Baby, baby, don't!
No, baby, don't
  (Baby baby, ooh, baby baby, don't)
Ooh, no, no no, baby, don't
  (Baby baby, ooh, baby baby, don't)
Baby, baby, don't
