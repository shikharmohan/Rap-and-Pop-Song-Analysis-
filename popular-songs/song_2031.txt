Baby don't you be so mean
I try to keep my conversation clean
But you the fliest thing I've seen
Since I came up in here, you're a superstar my dear
I don't wanna waste your time
With no corny playa lines, no
But girl if you don't mind
I will love to occupy the space right by your side
Girl can we chill?
Talk about leavin' together, sure we will
But just for now don't let my champagne spill on you
As you make your move to the floor, floor, floor, floor
Girl can we chill?
Talk about leavin' together, sure we will
Later I'll do everything you want me to
Makin' love to you, beg for more, more, more, more
Shawty speakin' honestly
I can picture you and me, yeah
Bein' ever so discreet
Disappearin' to the back of this club, imagine that
Baby, don't get mad at me, no, baby girl I was just playin'
Unless you really wanna go
You're in control, just let me know
But right now my song's playin', let's take it to the floor
Girl can we chill?
Talk about leavin' together, sure we will
But just for now don't let my champagne spill on you
As you make your move to the floor, floor, floor, floor
Girl can we chill?
Talk about leavin' together, sure we will
Later I'll do everything you want me to
Makin' love to you, beg for more, more, more, more
Ooh, don't wanna rush let's take it slow
Enjoy the night babe, then you decide if you want to
Get to know me on a physical side
Baby tonight let's get right
Girl can we chill?
Talk about leavin' together, sure we will
But just for now don't let my champagne spill on you
As you make your move to the floor, floor, floor, floor
Girl can we chill?
Talk about leavin' together, sure we will
Later I'll do everything you want me to
Makin' love to you, beg for more, more, more, more
