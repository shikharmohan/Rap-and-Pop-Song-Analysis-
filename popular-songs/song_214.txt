Ah ah ah ah
My head is over my heels, 'cause boy you got my heart
And if you play me, it would tear my world apart
My justice, part of the deal, so baby play ya cards
And if you play right, it only gets better
Maximum level and motions are running so high, so high
Crank up the volume, and let it flow, feels so right
Oh, you're my favorite DJ baby
Turn it up, turn it up
Just don't break my heart because it's
Burnin' up, burnin' up
Don't put out the fire baby
Turn it up, turn it up
Let's just dance the night away
I'll take you to your favorite place
Only if you turn it up
Already know what you want, know how to please ya
Can't love alone, 'cause babyboy I need you
You got control of my heart, turn up the level
Put it on repeat, 'cause it goes on and on forever
Maximum level and motions are running so high, so high
Crank up the volume, and let it flow, feels so right
Oh, you're my favorite DJ baby
Turn it up, turn it up
Just don't break my heart because it's
Burnin' up, burnin' up
Don't put out the fire baby
Turn it up, turn it up
Let's just dance the night away
I'll take you to your favorite place
Only if you turn it up
Oh, heart because it's...
Baby, fire baby, ayy
Night away, favorite place
Turn it up
Oh oh oh (turn it up)
Oh oh oh oh (turn it up)
Oh oh oh oh (turn it up)
Oh oh oh oh (turn it up)
Turn it up, turn it up
Just don't break my heart because it's
Burnin' up, burnin' up
Don't put out the fire baby
Turn it up, turn it up
Let's just dance the night away
I'll take you to your favorite place
Only if you turn it up
Turn it up (oh oh)
Turn it up (oh oh)
Turn it up (oh oh)
Turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up
Just don't break my heart because it's
Burnin' up, burnin' up
Don't put out the fire baby
Turn it up, turn it up
Let's just dance the night away
I'll take you to your favorite place
Only if you turn it up
