Come here girl I got a bottle of wine
we can pass it around till we're feeling fine and crazy
mmmm hmmmm
Been a long day let your hair fall down
we can dance for a while 
lay A- round and be lazy
mmmm hmmm
we love all night yeah baby
sure feels good when ya take me
in your arms
oh and then we start
we kiss like first time lovers
 tangled up in the covers
lets get it on
love me all night, make me miss ya all day long
gimme a look with your bedroom eyes
gonna lock it away up in my mind
for a daydream
mmm hmmmmm
well come on girl, come off of that sugar
take my hand baby now would ya lay me down
we love all night yeah baby
sure feels good when ya take me in your arms
ohh and then we start
we kiss like first time lovers
tangled up in the covers 
lets get it on
love me all night, make me miss ya all day long
Tomorrow I'll be watching that clock
on the wall
till we pick back up 
right where we left off
Love all night yeah baby
sure feels good when ya take me, in your arms
ohhh and then we start
we kiss like 1st time lovers
tangled up in the covers
lets get it on
Love me all night make me miss ya all day long
all day long baby(all day long)
all day long (all day long)
