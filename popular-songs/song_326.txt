It's another one and another one
One, one, one
This is where they stay crunk
Throw it up, dubs on tha Cadillac
White tees, Nikes
Gangstas don't know how to act
Adams Ville, Bankhead
College Park, Carver Homes
Hummers floatin' on chrome
Chokin' on that home-grown
They got that southern cookin'
They got them fellas lookin'
Thinkin' I was easy, I can see it
That's when I say no, what for
Shawty can't handle this
Ciara got that fire like
Oh, 'round here we ridin' slow
We keep it gotta, you should know
Gettin' crunk off in tha club
We gets low, oh
Oh, all my ladies to tha flo'
Handle it, ladies, back it up
Gettin' crunk up in tha club
We gets low, oh
Buddy take a new whip
Paint strip into a bowlin' ball
Still smoke unemsmote
Wood-grain on tha wall
Light-skinned thick chicks
Fellas call 'em redbones
Close cuts, braids long
Gangstas love 'em all
They got that southern cookin'
They got them fellas lookin'
Wishin' I was easy I can see it
That's when I say no, what fo'?
Shawty can't handle this
Ciara got that fire like
Oh, 'round here we ridin' slow
We keep it gotta, you should know
Gettin' crunk off in tha club
We gets low, oh
Oh, all my ladies to tha flo'
Handle it, ladies, back it up
Gettin' crunk up in tha club
We gets low, oh
Southern-style, get wild, old skools comin' down
On a different color whip, whip, whip
Picture perfect, you might wanna take a
Flick, flick, flick, flick, flick
Call up Jazze, tell him pop up the bottles
'Cuz we got another hit, hit, hit
Wanna go platinum, I'm who you should
Get, get, get, get, get
Ludacris on tha track, get back trick
Switch on tha 'Lac, I'm flexin' still
Same price every time, hot song, jumped on
'Cuz Ciara got sex appeal
And I keep the meanest, cleanest, baddest
Spinnin' on stainless wheels
Could care less about your genus
I bump ya status, I keep the stainless steel
Trunk-rattlin' what's happenin', huh?
I don't even think I need to speed
Bass-travelin', face-crackilin' huh?
Turn it up and make the speakers bleed
Dirty south we ballin' dawg
And neva think about fallin' dawg
Ghetto harmonizin', surprisin',
Runnin' back, 'cuz tha song is cold
Oh, 'round here we ridin' slow
We keep it gotta, you should know
Gettin' crunk off in tha club
We gets low, oh
Oh, all my ladies to tha flo'
Handle it, ladies, back it up
Gettin' crunk up in tha club
We gets low, oh
Oh, all my ladies to tha flo'
Handle it, ladies, back it up
Gettin' crunk up in tha club
We gets low, oh
