Not gone let it stress me no more
I won't put up with you and your drama, no, not tonight
No, not tonight I ain't thinkin' 'bout ya
Your insecurities ain't gonna stop me, no, not tonight
I'm gonna get up, get out, I ain't thinkin' about you
I did everything that you wanted me to
I was everything that you wanted me to
Floss up in the streets representing you
All your fantasies in the bedroom
No, still not enough so I have had enough
I'm gonna get up, get out, I ain't thinkin' about you
Get up, get out, I ain't thinkin' about you
No ohh, I won't play myself no more
No ohh, said I won't worry myself
Really don't want to deal with this so
Not gonna let it stress me no more
Gonna get up, get out, I ain't thinkin' about you
Get up, get out, I ain't thinkin' about you
You fuss at me 'cause yo' girl think I'm fly
Just how the hell can you say that's my fault
But if they're undressing me
Won't you tell your girls to check they eyes
Starin' at your guy
I was everything that you wanted me to
I did everything that you wanted me to
Walked up in the streets representing you
All your fantasies in the bedroom
No, still not enough so I have had enough
I'm gonna get up, get out, I ain't thinkin' about you
Get up, get out, I ain't thinkin' about you
No ohh, I won't play myself no more
No ohh, said I won't worry myself
Really don't want to deal with this so
Not gonna let it stress me no more
Gonna get up, get out, I ain't thinkin' about you
Get up, get out, I ain't thinkin' about you
Throw on a fresh fit and gas up the whip
And get where I'ma get tonight
Said I tried my best to be your best
And now I'm stressed out
Pop a bottle or two wit you and my crew
Ain't thinkin' 'bout you tonight
Stress somebody else
I am gonna enjoy myself tonight
No ohh, I won't play myself no more
No ohh, said I won't worry myself
Really don't want to deal with this so
Not gonna let it stress me no more
Gonna get up, get out, I ain't thinkin' about you
Get up, get out, I ain't thinkin' about you
No ohh, I won't play myself no more
No ohh, said I won't worry myself
Really don't want to deal with this so
Not gonna let it stress me no more
Gonna get up, get out, I ain't thinkin' about you
Get up, get out, I ain't thinkin' about you
