The kids were up before dawn this morning
Straight to the Christmas tree they ran
They called up the stairs for us to hurry
They waited for this day for about as long as they could stand
While trading presents the little one asks me
"Why do we have Christmas each year"
I said, "Long ago a Child was born this day
He's a gift more precious then all you see here"
'Cause on this day
A Child was born in the town of Bethlehem
And on this day
God sent His Son to bring peace and goodwill to all men
Oh, on this day we call Christmas, we honor His name
On this day, we recall all the reasons He came
On this day, on this day
Grandma and grandpa arrived after breakfast
The rest of the gang by noon
We spent the day watching football and breaking in toys
Helping out in the kitchen catching up on old news
And when that dinner bell rang, we all took our places
Grandpa said "Who wants to say grace?"
But before anyone else could utter a word
Oh, the little one bowed her head and then she started to say
On this day
A Child was born in the town of Bethlehem
And on this day
God sent His Son to bring peace and goodwill to all men
Oh, on this day we call Christmas, we honor His name
On this day, we recall all the reasons He came
On this day, on this day
Oh, on this day we call Christmas, we honor His name
On this day, we recall all the reasons He came
On this day, oh, on this day, yeah
