Ah yea
Whole world
MCs
Whose slick?
We lounge stay phat notice our G limp
A natural flair with our fresh ass hair
Style baggy out clouts slick
Creamy and fresh east coast to west
Brooklyn
Uptown
To the universal fair
Old school MCs
I'm slicker this year, I'm slicker this year
Myrtle Ave A train got the pic in my hair
And what 16 joints later still lounge
Fresh, from flatbush in my baggy booster gets
Style is tight ees bust the cami' fatigues
50,000 leagues of black, so what's up
Can we avenue slide player style ghetto walk
To the east and wild Crooklyn, New york
Creamy kid yo Smith and Wesson win a blessing
The angular slang blow spots, bang, 11
Hangin' like bats,'cause the 12 inch wax
Say scorpio and my hair say 'fro
And my blood say bro, my clics say, "Eh, yo!"
Make sparks from the barrel me tal pistol
To the depths I dive seems lunar like aqua
The cool blast mega we black we wild flowers
Scott La Rock had emm all, I gots the ball
And roll a little panthers through these project halls
The 3 color flag can't hold my baggys sag
7 1 8 to omega
Black motion is ocean style
Slick in my ways since days of the classic
Now glamour boys want to be triple phatted
But I'm slicker this year, I'm slicker this year, yea
East born Beast candles on
Lovely all over the city
And your tape deck blasting
7 hours and the phat fly sneakers and the camouflage
To the hip hop nation
To the mixtape crew
To the west coast
To the boogie down Bronx
I was raised in the ways of the Manchu Clan
And 5 elements posture take a B boy stance
With the gold front shinin', the baggy pants saggin'
This Brooklyn stylin' got the fly girls smilin'
But I'm climbin', findin' new ways of rhymin'
Not livin' like a star is strickly about survivin'
Divin', deep into the groove of the ghetto
This downtown flavor shines from many angles
Yes, the notorious, with rhymes so glorious
The Manchu Monkey over flunkies is victorious
Rappers be boring us with rhymes of conventional
Dazed and amazed when they hear the three dimensional
Lyrical skills of the insect emotion
Coasting down Fulton with a bag of magic potion
Now I'm rolling with the 7 and the crescent
Puffin' some expression, manifestin' today's lesson
Stressin the fact that I'm solar guarenteed to go far
'Cause the mind is inter stellar
Still pieced like that so have no fear
But I'm slicker this year, I'm slicker this year
To the queens everywhere
To the whole S I
To the lumpen mass
Don't forget about your peeps when ya
Now you see that I am 68 inches above sea level
93 million miles above these devils
Play me in the winter, play me in the summer
Play me in the autumn, any order
You want 'em I got 'em drippin' like water
Catch me at a hot spot with the dusk daughters
We bouncing, moving within the truth circles
We played you made you change,strictly ought to
We stratify our wealth from my looty in the bank
There's love amongst the ranks
Now I'm a 'bout to meet my homegirl 'cause we be alike
A alike, C alike, let's G alike

(On the wheels)
Jazzy Joyce
(No one's smoother)
Jazzy Joyce
(Phatter than a '94 land cruiser)
Where you from?
(The Bronx representin' like whatever, fly)
Cool are you slicker this year?
(Yea, watch)
Hit it
Hit it
Hit it
