I hold it down
I hold it down
I hold it down
I hold it down
Aight, Staten Island, what up?
Yeah, Long Island, what up? Come on
Jazzy Jeff, y'all
Philly, what's good?
Haha, New Jersey
Yo, I just had a Philly Cheese Steak
That shit was good as a muthafucka, baby
Yo, yo, who do it till the death?
Let the magnificent Jeff go do it to the rest
You see the difference, assumin' we a threat
Y'all just impotent, ain't no use of screwin' with the best, naw
I wrote a 16 and throw it in a tech
Shootin' game at these fools now for foolin' with a vet, yeah
It's Mr. Mef really, who did you expect?
Another shit talkin' MC with booty on the breath, naw
Let's smoke somethin', let your dude hold somethin'
And this dudes coke runnin' till the blue coats comin' yes
Cruise still stuntin', radio still frontin'
And the stuff they still bumpin' got me numb, I feel nothin', Jeff
So I'ma get it like I spit it
Get my glass, you can fill it to the rim with the realest and
I'm talkin' back when Biggie Smalls was the illest
And the boys from Cypress Hill said 'How I Could Just Kill A Man'
Already knowin' how we go, let's get at your people
I'm flowin', these streets know I hold it down
And put it down with The G Code, Jeff, just let the beat go
I'm reppin' the East Coast, so hold it now
Already knowin' how we go, let's get at your people
I'm flowin', these streets know I hold it down
And put it down with The G Code, Jeff, just let the beat go
I'm reppin' the East Coast, so hold it now
Until my nuts get room enough to breath
I'ma break down the leaf, my brotha, crush the weed
Not Puff Daddy, no boy, I puff the trees
In a room full of crackers, I might cut the cheese
They called me Mr. I got what you need
And a bag of sour dezz, you ain't gotta pluck the seeds, naw
So hit the peddle, I'll bring you up to speed
Nearly smashed up to Beamer, no more cognac for me
See, I'm in my backyard still cleanin'
All the fiends still fiendin', better deal with the demons and
I'm just bein' rash, I'm like what's the meanin'
'Cause as far as MCin' I ain't likin' what I'm seein', man
Nah, so M E F's on some other shit
Feel it like that first piece of pussy, fell in love with it
Y'all know what up with it, if I got my brother
Get money, clothes, hoes, 24's on the mothership
Already knowin' how we go, let's get at your people
I'm flowin', these streets know I hold it down
And put it down with The G Code, Jeff, just let the beat go
I'm reppin' the East Coast, so hold it now
Already knowin' how we go, let's get at your people
I'm flowin', these streets know I hold it down
And put it down with The G Code, Jeff, just let the beat go
I'm reppin' the East Coast, so hold it now
