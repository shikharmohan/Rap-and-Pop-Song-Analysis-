I'm pulling your mask off
As soon as you act up
You know what i came for
A peace of the game or
Artilary thats as long as a chainsaw
I buy them weight
But tis still feels like i'm dreamin
40. calinger my pillow cinda feel like my c-men
I fysical pressence of a female the form of a demon
that's why i fuck em and leave em get my nut while im breathin
And i thought they catch me slippin now im ducking and drippin, thats a thousand dollar outfit wuth the fuck is you brickin
You trippin the record can get my ass in position
Death wish for no religon wether catholic or christian
Listen, and when trough momma bitchen in and out the kitchen wuth probable cause is probable in and out the prison
We got soldiers
but you still gotta respect ours
We got more 4-5s and nines then a deck of cards
(Tony Yayo)
