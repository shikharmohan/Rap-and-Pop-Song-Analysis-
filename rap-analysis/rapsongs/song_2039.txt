{Hi baby, I know you're under a lot of pressure at your work and all
And I do understand, you have no idea how much I understand
But you also don't have any idea how much I love you
I love you so much, I think about you, I feel you in my arms
I miss you, I miss you terribly
I've just always wanted someone like you in my life
I love you so much, that I'd do anything, I'd do anything
I'll be your perfect woman for you}
I just wanna fuck bad bitches
All them nights I never had bitches
Now I'm all up in that ass bitches
Mad at 'cha boyfriend, ain't 'cha?
You'se a bad girl, gotta spank ya
Gotta thank ya for that head clinic
Explicit, hella photogenic
And tell your friends where the dick's at
Where they can get hit and won't get back to they soul mate
Before you kiss 'em use Colgate
She swallowed it! Yeah the bitch took the whole eight
And ran with it, then let Mel-Man hit it
And Hit the Man hit it; damn bitches
Man, this is what I'm talkin' about
Chicken-head, chicken-fed, with a dick in your mouth
Out and about with your nigga like it never took place
(Airtouched)
Next time you need a taste
I just wanna fuck you
No touchin' and rubbin' girl, you got a husband who loves you
Don't need you all in mine
I just wanna fuck you
We can't be kissin' and huggin' girl, you got a husband who loves you
You need to give him your quality time
You got the number, it's on you to make the call
You know I cum quick, help you re-decorate your walls
Cut your backyard, don't have to act hard to get the cock
And if I'm goin' too far, I take it out and wipe it off
And put it back up, and keep going
You tryin' to hide it from your husband but I know he be knowin'
That your pussy's been tampered with
Did you show him the new trick of
How you can make it smoke a cancer stick
You be workin' it like a dancer bitch, it's hard on me
Not to give you all of my time, that you want
You can give me some head, but keep the breakfast in bed
I'd rather spend my mornin' diggin' through some records instead
But, tonight, I guess it'd be aight if we can touch bases
Hook-up somewhere and exchange some fuck faces
I know your man's lookin' for ya, he's always tryin to run ya
Don't worry bout me handcuffin' girl cause I just wanna fuck witchu
Fuck witchu
On the sneak tip, on some creep shit
So whatcha gon' do, ya freak bitch?
You, actin', like you don't do dicks
That's the kinda bitch I hate fuckin' with
"Baby was a virgin" that's what she said
So I gave her some Hennesey, she gave me some head
I fucked her on the flo', so I wouldn't mess up my bed
Then lil' half dead put his dick on her head
Take that bitch home, and give her a bone
And give her the number to my cellular phone
Man, she blowin' up my pager, the shit's gettin' major
A favor for a favor, this dick is what I gave her
Somethin' to go by, and bitches know why
Stuff dick in they mouth, and then I'm out
(See ya!)
Twenty-fo' seven, Dre, Snoop, and Devin
We servin' these hoes, and never lovin' these hoes, beotch!
I just wanna fuck you
No touchin' and rubbin' girl, you got a husband who loves you
Don't need you all in mine
I just wanna fuck you
We can't be kissin' and huggin' girl, you got a husband who loves you
You need to give him your quality time
