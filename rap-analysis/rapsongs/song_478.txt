[Bizzy Bone]
Raising, hustlas, thieves and prostitutes
Young homie, think before you shoot, murderer........
Where will our children go
When there's no place safe where they can go
[Bizzy Bone]
And trouble may come and sometimes
You'll get pulled over by one-time
And when the 1999 rewinds, you didn't even make any strides
Murder all around the whole world, it's nauseatin
Everybody's hatin everybody, overrated
Why everybody actin agitated, I thought we graduated
Back in the saddle waitin, aboard the battle station
Hatin' is a birth defect and you know ain't nobody perfect
And when the curtains, close open up the door, no more
[Bridge-Big B]
See we loosin this world we love
And it looks like the sinnin won't end
So I'm reachin high up above
Lord, let your blessings begin
[Hook-Bizzy 4x]
And let's change the world, and let's change the world
[Flesh Bone]
It got me ready to set off the riot
Ridin wit my Trues Humbly United Gathering Souls
Here we go, roll up some more Phillies
My nigga let me hit it
Niggas we thugin immortalized, let's get high
It's them niggas you most desire
I can remember from way back in the day
Comin up out the ghetto was a hell of a struggle
From sellin the feinds llello
But it was my dream to kick flows and put my people on another
level
Now could it be for the lust (lust)?
Could it be for the rush (rush)?
My niggas love when they bust
They steady buck and they duck
They put your dick in the dust
My niggas creepin on a come up
Come up nigga, killa, thuggish ruggish nigga
Nigga, finna' descent into the dawn of a new millenium
Anticipatin life without Satan hatin, 
and all enemies to hell, I'm sendin them
[Hook]
[Layzie Bone]
Everyday the devil at me
And I wish the Lord throw a Hummer at me, I ain't happy
Me and Eazy E in a B-E-N-Z, with my niggas right next to me
It's my legacy, we can't let it stop, uh uh, not now
The whole world endin up in buck-buck-pow
Corruption, destruction, disaster
Everybody tryna' rap faster than the master
Oh Lord, could you save my soul?
Nigga tryna go platinum 'round 40 years old
The Lord know we can do this shit
It ain't no stoppin us now 'cause we can prove this shit
Nigga me, Stew D, PD, Freaky G
The whole world wanna be ridin with me
I'm in the flesh, let's talk about sex
Babies havin babies, Generation X
With the AIDS epidemic, we ain't pure no more
And I know they gotta cure for this shit, we ain't rich
First we lost Eazy, then we lost Pac
Biggie got killed, when this shit gon' stop?
Everybody wanna know, what's goin on 
with the thuggish, ruggish, Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone
Tryna' get prepared for the Y2K
And if I don't die today, Im'a tryna change the world
[Hook 2x]
[Wish Bone]
You need a lesson you can love from rappin
But they try an ban it, realize it ain't gon' happen
We done changed the world
Ghetto voices bein heard and felt
Now I got my guns, better arm yourselfs
Most don't have a clue, if goes down what to do, Don't you know this government they vote for me and you I have a dream, no, I have a wish If we can't save ourselves, then let's aid the kids
Let the world go (wrong) let these babies have somethin
Let the world go (wrong) just don't blow this muthaf**ka up
You kill him, he'll kill you
Some say its stupid but violence really lives where I come from (come from)
Hungry little kids where I come from(come from)
Thugs like me where I come from (come from)(come from)
[Krayzie Bone]
Sometimes I sit and think about if I could change the world
Get in the mind of the nigga boys and girls
Show 'em that it is a better way
Satan got you trippin' don't listen to what the devil say
'Cause he can deceive ya
Play with your brain and mislead ya
But it won't be long
'Til the angels come
There's no where to hide but he'll run
Babylon the great has fallen
God is callin'
We all in y'all in
Souljahs go marchin' in bombin' 'em
But this time we ain't talkin'
We are tryin' to hit the target we launchin'
Police brutality got to cease
But I see the NYPD don't want peace
And the LAPD don't want peace
So we'll never be free
So come on
We only got to the end of time to change the world we shall over come (change the world)We only got to the end of time to change the world we shall over come 
(Hook2)
Its a crazy mixed up world,
Its the end of the world
Its a crazy mixed up world
'cause its the end of the world
Its a crazy mixed up world
Its the end of the world
Its a crazy mixed up world
'cause its the end of the world
(Bizzy in background)
See wehre loosing this world we love
and it looks like the sinning wont end.. hatin' is a birth defect and you know ain't nobody perfect
And when the curtains, close, open up the door, no more
(Lazyie Bone in Background)
First we lost Eazy, then we lost Pac
Biggie got killed, when this shit gon' stop? Everybody wanna know, what's goin on with the thuggish, ruggish, Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone
(Wish Bone in Background)
Most don't have a clue, when it goes down what to do, Don't you know this government they vote for me and you I have a dream, no, I have a wish If we can't save ourselve, then let's aid the kids
(Krayzie Bone in Background)
Cause he can deceive ya
Play with your brain and mislead ya
But it won't be long
'Til the angels come
There's no where to hide but he'll run
