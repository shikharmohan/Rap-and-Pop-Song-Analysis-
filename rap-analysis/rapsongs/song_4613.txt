I don't want nobody but you
I think we should move towards the future
I don't want nobody but you
I think we should move towards the future
Baby, I'm serious
How  you know when I'm like shit
You don't know me yet I ain't step with no disrespect
Just somethin' in your eyes got me
I mean somethin' in your thighs got me
On the rise like the third right
Pooh's flight ain't for one night or one flight in the sack
One fight got me restin' my back on big pooh's couch
Got me kicked out my own house, arguin' with my own spouse
Sweet heart please it is not worth the fuss
I would rather kiss then send you a cuss
I'd rather us hold hands ridin' on the back of the bus
Then have us pissed off rollin' the trust c'mon, now
I don't want nobody but you
I think we should move towards the future
I don't want nobody but you
I think we should move towards the future
Baby, I'm serious
Threw out my fantasies and all my destinies
I'd like to be involved in you caresin' me
You tellin' me that love can be the sweetest thin'
Reality has been sent to me from
Hey yo it's been a long time since we been out, got tipsy
And pull the gin out, sat down thinkin' of you and pulled
My pen out, sexin' with you is more then just sweaty in out
She meltin' my ice grill, girl and bought the grin out
I never thought that I would get this shit out, imagine me
That nigga walkin' around in the mall with matchin' time's out
Emotions I got to get out
Down with a nigga way before I had a hit out now that's splendid
My brothers love you and my moms recommend it
Carry my seed now I'm carryin' independence
So why we got to keep this love joint suspended
I'm tryin' to build a family girl because we acendrick
I don't want nobody but you
I think we should move towards the future
I don't want nobody but you
I think we should move towards the future
Baby, I'm serious
I don't want nobody but you
I think we should move towards the future
I don't want nobody but you
I think we should move towards the future
Baby, I'm serious
Baby, I'm serious
I don't want nobody but you
I think we should move towards the future
I don't want nobody but you
I think we should move towards the future
