Y'all motherfuckers buckle y'all motherfuckin seatbelts  
 If you need to get high  there's a mask and shit in the overhead compartment  
 I can't tell y'all what the weather's like 'cause my radio's fucked up  
 And if we should experience any type of motor difficulty  
 Don't panic  take one more hit off the oxygen mask  
 Calmly put your hands between your legs  
 And kiss your black ass goodbye!!  
 
 When I send my vapors off like Halls menthalyptus  
 I'm swift like a motherfuckin gift for Christmas  
 My verbs and nouns shatter walls of underground  
 Let me be blunt: I like crackin brews with bitches  
 The ninety-four era I cause terror, whatEVER  
 Rainin on you punks with the funk, so get your umbrellas  
 My guns cruise, tennis shoes, what's happenin  
 I got clapped on, now I'm the one doin the clappin  
 I'm Flexi Wit Da Tec like Artifacts make Memorex  
 blow tape decks when I'm more strapped than latex  
 Felt like menopause, I make niggaz act like beatches  
 Woo! I just don't give a FUCK  
 Yo yo that nigga Red be frontin -- with they ass full of stitches  
 I bite your whole nipple off, sick like sickle-cell anemia  
 I'm droppin 98.7 degrees down to Red Alert  
 Travel around my curse universe  
 Droppin the slang, I'll bust your brains with the real shit  
 Come hit my blunt so I can make y'all feel it  
 Abuse niggaz verbally so call Dyfus  
 I'm a warrior, to the heart, but I didn't kill Cyrus  
 I get as ill as chief of police on narcotic  
 Noorotic, my style format rocks the project  
 Give me a time and I'll free your mind and lick your  
 funky emotions, to blow your veins up with funk overdosing  
 Not with guns with funk when I rock tracks like Van Halen  
 Now who's that nigga that got your crew bellin?  
 I'm in the world, with Jacob's Ladder  
 
 I'm seein a lot of happy copycat rappers actin like they got asthma  
 They attackin me, they slowin they rhymes down actually  
 But it's no question my funk segment leave the whole atmosphere  
 They got factories with little dolls named after me  
 pressed-in, I take advantage of niggaz like I was molesterin  
 Newark New Jersey's what I represent  
 Iiiiiiiyiiiihhhhh  
 My brain be zoned and I phoned home to ET's home  
 Whattup to Prince Street, Avon Ave I roll a spliff with  
 and to hook me up with stash spots to put my chrome in  
 So what the fuck I got clapped on for my truck  
 Fat to be passed through Bedrock and Diamond District  
 Then I laughed cause fuck the cash I just wanted my tape bag  
 Fantastic fabulous my shit is fat shit  
 The bomb like Elway throw bombs on John Madden  
 Fuck that, let's get to the point, my shit's the joint, I roast  
 Motherfuckers from the East coast to the West coast to your breakfast  
 voltage, I got funk for days by the buckets  
 PPP packs a bunch of wild motherfuckers  
 
 Hold hold hold, wait wait wait  
 Let me school this bitch  
 Yo bitch my shit is tight, can any MC do this  
 *sounds of sex*  
 And come back on the mic?  
 
 I think not, my paper make pen leave nuff ink spots  
 Sayin I'm this and that when half y'all punks don't even know me  
 On blocks where your punk ass still bustin off slingshots  
 Talkin shit about me when I'm drivin by slowly  
 Now just for that I let your girl suck my dick from the back  
 and let your moms give me cornrows on my crack  
 Cause I'm nasty like that
