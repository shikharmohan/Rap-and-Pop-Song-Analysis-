As I was way in the back I noticed that
Salt was rockin' the hell out of some of you cats
Then I decided to slow down the tempo to let you catch your breath
So just wait for the drum roll then you can feel the flow of
Syncopated soul power
Got to have syncopated soul power
All you need is syncopated soul power
Yeah, gimme some soul power
Everybody needs soul power
I'm the Pepa, much deffer half-stepper? No, I'm never
World renowned as a vocalist when Salt is not around I'm a soloist
Puttin' pep in your step seriously, conquest is the best lyrically
The mic is a component I use on my opponents only to flaunt it
It just sound good, don't it? Rhyme power, organic as a sunflower
And full of soul power
All I got is syncopated soul power
All you need is syncopated soul power
Cold kickin' soul power
Steady kickin' soul power
Now raise your hands and keep 'em there for a minute
I'm gonna tell you what to do with it wave it like a flag, dirty rag
Keep 'em there till they get jet lag Pepa's on the mic
And the mic is on if Salt's at my side, nothing can go wrong
Meet the mix empress, Spinderella, head on
And that, my friend, is the meaning of a rap song
Keep your shirt on, don't lose the buddies if I ain't done rappin' yo
Spin, keep cuttin' ain't nothin' gonna stop us now
We on a roll with syncopated soul power
Got to have syncopated soul power
All you need is syncopated soul power
Soul power, soul power
Soul power, soul power
