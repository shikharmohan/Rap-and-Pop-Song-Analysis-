Drought 3
Yezzir
Look
I bought it out like stunna
I hope when we kiss we make u sick to yo stomach
Stunning like my daddy
And ya momma eat rubbers
I bet i can do da mouf 2 mouf with ya woman
My house is a dungeon
Yellow diamond ring lookin like a little funyon
Stand on my toes you can call me Paul Bunyon
Switchin up my flo's like a nigga do construction
Da microfone wet cuz my words like seduction
N when we on the jet you dont come up in the discussion
And if you say you ballin we prolly dont trust ya
And I know plenty freaky hoes dat prolly wont fuck ya
Even if you pay em boy they prolly wont fuck ya
Only if i say dat she can touch ya like busta
But she might touch ya
And burn ya like usher
Me n my clique be in red like russia
I shit these rappers out and sometimes i forget 2 flush ya
Grand daddy purp or bubble kush crusha
Explode in a bitch mouf like a gusha
Cash money young money
Check da production
I am just a martian
Get prepared for abduction
Haha
Haha
Uuum...
I walk it out like crutches
2 girls jump me like double dutchers
My nigga t-streets know a girl named dutchess
And everytime we see her in da streets she b cussin
I told em he should wave da black flag cuz she buckin
He said the pussy good
He said ya digg
So i dugg em
Im lookin for a real bad bitch wit a husband
I give em much dick
And a whole lot of nuttin
Im spittin like i stumbled on a gold pot or sumthin
And when i was 6 i saw my role model hustlin
So i gotta hustle
