Now that you know how I feel about you
Don't let it go to your head, no
Don't let it go to your head, no, no, no
Now that you know I can't live without you
Don't let it go to your head, no
Don't let it go to your head, no, no, no
Don't take advantage of my love
Treat me good, treat me fair, treat me fair
Now that I've given you every part of me
Don't let it go to your head, no
Don't let it go to your head, no, no, no, no
'Cause if you're playing games
It would be a shame
Don't break my heart
Don't break my heart
'Cause if you're playing games
It would be a shame
Don't break my heart
Don't break my heart
No, no, no, no
Now that you know how I feel about you
Don't let it go to your head, no
Don't let it go to your head, no, no, no, no
Now that you know I can't live without you
Don't let it go to your head, no
Don't let it go to your head, no, no, no, no
Don't let it, don't let it
Don't let it go to your head, no
Don't let it, don't let it
Don't let it go to your head, no, no, no, no
Don't let it, don't let it, don't let it
Don't let it go to your head, no
Don't let it, don't let it, don't let it
Don't let it go to your head, no
Don't let it, don't let it, don't let it
