You crept and you came and shit changed

Nigga what you sayin' you came and you went
Now bet on the real it's all the way to the bank and you think
Fin to get that gangster getting a demon you can conjure up and see
If we get angels pinnin' my ankles bloody murder fuck wit Jesus
He done creeping deep puttin' those to sleep
Till I raise up on my enemies
Let's get pumped for the peeps in Egypt and 400 years of oppression
Spread the message I ain't finished diminished you so called critics
And fuck them billboard and the billboard status me kick it
You fucked up for a while up outta the town but that was a trial
Man and I don't know how style through with them crowds and now
I got to kick it breakin' new ground wantin' my people to gather around
Remember the sound of the rounds came from my town
That only a bitch would bite that we can't allow
And they won't claim my style ready to beat you down
Hittin' them tombstones

Getting in costumes now I'm rolling with Makaveli
Pinnin' my pistol steady ready

And a point where I break your hand in nigga yeah
I beg your pardon my nigga but how do you know me

Put him in the river now nigga who wild wild
What incredible style that's what you was thinkin'
When you tried to get it down
We see that you fuck with a daily crowd so nigga just turn your ass out
Whenever you ready to rumble my nigga just meet us outside of the club
Ready to slang slugs nigga done got to drunk and forgot that we claim MO' nigga this shit is ridiculous
Just dismiss the thought that you could get rid of us
Buck you to hell it was nigga you down with us

Ready for the war all day want action playa hation steadily spray 'em
Hit 'em with the buck buck bang my nigga this shit don't stop
The government all on my dick wanna see little Lay Bone drop
You see the policeman they give me no break
Fin to rest in peace when they try to send me up state no thanks

Refuse the peace and nevertheless
Then you can roll with the bone so come on
When all goes down when all goes down you can count on me
