Chrous: (2x)
You know i grind, straight hustle, hit licks, 
get em break em down, weigh bricks

that why i had to try one for the streets right quick
(Jeezy) 
Four one two fives two on the counter
whats the scene? a triple bean 
two money counters two fifties dem five hunrdeds
they in the plastic oil thangs them one thousandths 
they in the attic. 
yellow shit that have you itchin that instant linchin

(Slick Pulla)
Do it all again hell yeah you know i would 
i almost lost my life puttin this chrome under the hood
i damn near lost it all for these cars and these jewels

the microwave will get it done but i prefer the stove 
all black sivich hatch back now im on the roll 
made the play and came back now i gotta fresh sack 
four hours there four hours back 
had to get that road cash residue on the stacks we just call it 
blow cash 
in the streets pickin chins thats better than no cash
