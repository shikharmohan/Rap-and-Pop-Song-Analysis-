[Talib Kweli]
Ay yo the prophet is without honor
In your own country,
people swear that you ain't shit because they know your mama
So much drama at the crib it ain't fit to live
And that survival of the fittest shit will split your wig
Cats master doin' bits of illegitimate kids is splitin' dutches
Dealin' with the physical and caught up in his clutches
My way of life bum-rushes pullin' no punches
Silence is golden and all I'm hearin' is hushes, when I'm shinin'
MC's pay attention
I rise like a ascention see more than three dimension
to the situation we facin receivin energy
So you see who your friend and who your enemy
[Morcheeba]
Crashin back down to earth I've found
We can love
Oh let me see
All of the places I can be
Oh let me know
All of the places where we can go
[Talib Kweli]
Yo we rock on shed like light the break of dawn 
Stand strong like the words in God's song
B-Boys, make some noise and B-Girls, rock the world and
[Morcheeba]
Falling apart right from the start
Crawling round
Oh let me see all of the place that I can be
Oh let me know all of the places where we can go
[Talib Kweli]
A blind man feels the wickedest taste is exquisite
He can hear me lound and clear and smell fear in the air
Without sight he gains in-sight and lets me see his true self
not what he wants me to precive him to be
Preception is deception
Without the facts you keep guessin
That's the image in the mirror so we Eternal Reflection
Forever manifestin' the cleverness in the lesson
Dropin' with authority with no doubt, no question
Yo my man's blazin' more cheeba
Blowin' out like speakers
Keepin' y'all open wide like receivers
We rock on shed like light the break of dawn..
And we stand strong like the words in God's song c'mon
[Morcheeba]
Show us how to stand up stong
Waitin' for you takes so long
Shadows leave us standing naked
We can't fake it
Oh let me see all of the places that I can be
Oh let me know all of the places where we can go
Oh let me see all of the places that I can be
Oh let me know all of the places where we can go
[Talib Kweli]
B-Boys, make some noise and B-Girls, rock the world and
B-Girls, rock the world and c'mon and
Pick it up yes
and we put it down, yes we put it down
Another Hi-Tek production
Talib Kweli, MCs ain't got nothin'
Blaze up... more cheeba, more cheeba
Cheeba, everybody say cheeba, everybody cheeba
