Thinking
I been through it all, the fails the falls
I'm like Niagara but I got right back up like Viagra
I am agriculture
Swagga so mean it might insult ya
Ha, I'm like an ultra vulture
I fuck around and catapult ya
Torture, thought ya parents taught ya
You guys is chocha I'm gone buenos noches
Flow scorch ya and I don't even write
No author, so harder, so smarter
All about a dollar like four quarters
Oh father, will tonight be my last
And if so make sure my kids see my cash
And I know I'm silent like an elbow cast
And my future will be better than my past, Weezy
You can love me or hate me
I swear it won't make me or break me
I'm goin' wherever the money take me
Until a funeral awake me
And don't wake me
'Cause I'm sleepin', I'm dreamin'
I know that there is a better way
'Cause I've seen it Lord
But this faster money is so convenient
And I need it say I need it
C A R T E R
I spit movies like a VCR
I spit rounds like the tiki bar
And if I got beef I'm the meat cleaver
And I are the illest nigga Martin Luther King died for
And I ride for, Hollygrove one seven Eagle street
And I'm higher than an eagle's feet but I believe in me
Apple is the car street I am just an offspring
Born in the ghetto that's why I can't let go
One call I have my dawgs on ya like an echo
Baby, I am the real deal no pickle
Spit sickle-cell pyscho
I go off like a muthafuckin' rifle
And I'm from the underground baby like a pipe mole
I will stand tall like a light poles until the light blows
And you can love me or hate me
Baby, I swear it won't make me or break me
And I'm be goin' wherever the money take me
Until the funeral awake me and don't wake me
'Cause I'm sleepin' and I'm dreamin'
See I'm just hustlin' livin' what I believe in, dawg
And it's a problem when my homies not eatin'
And I'm greedy, I'm greedy
Share my blood, feed my family
My flow I'll have to plead insanity
So sick I need Grey's Anatomy
Acid like a bust open battery
I'm cool like L.A. nights
I'm tight like ballet tights
Aye Juelz, I swear the otha day I pissed Crystal
These bitches tryna kick it like June Tow
I gotta watch my head in the battle
I'm just tryin' ta stay ahead of my shadow
And I'm floatin' like a boat in the battle
Alligators and rattle snakes
But I promise I would take a nigga off like a Saturday
Got money to validate, I'm icey like carrot cake
Different color diamonds make me look like a salad plate
I'm straight out the alley way
It's the nigga ya daddy hate
Weezy F baby, great
I know they love me they hate me
But I'm a G it won't make me or break me
And you can find me wherever the money place me
Yeah,until you ridin' to the late me and don't wake me
'Cause I'm sleepin' and I'm dreamin'
And me and my Lord got an agreement, y'all
And so I thank him everyday for my achievements
And I'm Weezy, I'm Weezy
