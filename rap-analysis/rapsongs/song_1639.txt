You try to get over
You're gonna go under
You try to get over
You're gonna go under
Literally it's 3030
I don't got time
To be wasting time on you
Slow pokes
I want ya all to, get open, like the ocean
Brothers be buggin like, "He's from Oakland?"
What? I'll whoop you insinuatin' we ain't capable
Stupid ass niggas is gonna rape a hoe
A few out a thousand
My town is foundin' fathers of the black panthers
We provide answers
You don't wanna believe
Then ya all are some blind bastards
They got you set up real good your neuralizing
Industry rising while energies reclining
Niggas think I'm whinin' but I really don't give a shit
'Cuz everybody's dyin' but ya all think that's the end of it
That's why it's so easy to be a Benedict
Or imitate 'cuz they wouldn't teach ya Algebra
When you was eight
Now you fornicate and you hate children
Forgot where you came from now your straight illin'
Don't fight the feelin', you better deal with it
It don't matter what you do or say
Try to get away but I'm gonna catch ya
Wanna compare your self to them
Well guess what homeboy you
Don't match up
I'm my own individual so I know it isn't true
Just 'cuz you say it is 'cuz anything thats truth
Got proof it, ain't you?
Thats simply just the way it is
Lookin' up the sky is red
City's burning up over head
(Flame on baby)
We can make the best of it
(Rock that)
In this post apocalypse
(Right on)
I'm on some real shit
So real brothers feel this
'Cuz we know reality is crazy
Thats why nothin' amaze me
Look in the past, you might have to go
Farther then the book in your class
My niggas cookin' some crack
And mom's gets the first hit
Thats okay with you? thats okay with me
I'm not here to judge the way you be
I got my own complications
The government shoe less rations
Plantations is man labor
For five bucks for hourly intervals
I get a G for that
So believe what I spit to you is given back
Don't think that I'm livin' that dream
When the I.R.S reposes most of your cream
Its like I dream when I lye I wake up
I see all the people I disrespected
And try to make up
It's praise to the creator
Relate to nature
