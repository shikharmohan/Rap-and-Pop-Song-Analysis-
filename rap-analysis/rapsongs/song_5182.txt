Dead crosswords puzzling your delf
(Get your headpiece strapped on tight)
See that's what I'm talkin' 'bout
When you take the Johnny Blaze
(You're dealing with Johnny Blaze, the Johnny Blaze)
And you take that game and you plug that here into Bobby Steels
(Ohh yeah)
Now you are playing with power
  (Yeah get that mouthpiece screwed on right dude)
  You're dealing with the Bobby Steels, the Bobby Steels)
With power
(Now you are playing with power)
I got your mind twisted
Unrealistic wavelength drainin' on your brain-strip inflicted
Crosswords puzzling your delf
Questioning your own mental health, yeah
It's like a maze within itself
Yeah, check the grimey, slimey, slimey
Criminiminal individual, I be
Searching for the Dark Knight
Lurking in the shadows of the city, he roll with jiggy
My crime committee
Robbing every Gotham piggy bank blind
Take a journey through the mind of a Riddler
Tax free money not a problem
A price to get the ice not a problem
A body for a price not a problem
Hmm, The Riddler
Once again it's the mind bender, three-time felony offender
Demented, brain cemented, mixed in the blender
I lose ya, mass confusion, question mark clues in
What, where, why, whose-in, quiz
Time to ask yourself who it is
Sheisty P.L.O. underhanded biz, invadin' brothers wigs
Can I live? Corrupt and bringin' all the misery and suffering
Pain, you couldn't cure with a Bufferin
Rotating, ridiculous, rapid-fire riddle
Bat get trapped in the middle of The Riddler
Murder for the evil, not a problem
To the gen there ain't no sequel, not a problem
Big up to all my people not a problem
It's The Riddler
Observe if you will
I'm in my hide-out in the back of the hill
I crack a wall then I caught about a mil'
Co-defendants Johnny Blaze and Bobby Steels
We was blazing hotware
Turn the corner you can hear the wheels squeal
On that ass fast was the Batmobile
I can tell by the demon on the grill, this was real
Alley-cat screamin', I hit a trash can
Garbage everywhere, money flyin' out the bags and
Tryin' to escape, code nine with the cape
Or else he'd be headed upstate, it's The Riddler
Talkin' suicide, not a problem
If you're speakin' homicide, not a problem
You want to talk genocide, not a problem
It's The Riddler
No law, word up, no law
Stimulimuli, stimulimuli
Feel good, don't it? And you [Incomprehensible] it
Got ta, hotter, you're playing with power
