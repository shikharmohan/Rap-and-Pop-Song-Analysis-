The radio is so clear in here
Hey, hey love
Talkin' 'bout 'Hey Love'
Wanna be your push and shove
Pop, popcorn up above
Move like Soul when I say
Go to a club around the way
And see my 'Hey DJ'
And make him play 'Hey Love'
Discover all the football teams
Mack and eat jelly beans
Run in the cold with no jeans
Get yourself sick till we're seen
Catch the flu and make tea
How Dan Stuckie life will be
It's all about you and me
'Cause you're my 'Hey Love'
Hey, move me like Soul when I say
Go to a club around the way
And see my 'Hey DJ'
And make him play 'Hey Love', hey
Look Pos, we gotta talk, talk about what?
Don't play stupid with me, you know what we gotta talk about
What? About you becoming fully dedicated
So we're about to go through these line-runs again, huh?
You're damn right, I wanna know whatever you do for me has
Anything to do with love
Look, I come all the way from L.I. to the Bronx to see you
Isn't that showing you love?
You see that's just it Pos, I don't wanna be just your Bronx love
I wanna be your 'Hey Love', you wanna be my what?
I said I wanna be your 'Hey Love', I mean it's just not the mood
Being one of the many girls on your list
And you wouldn't be dissing me like this if I was your 'Hey Love'
Look, I do everything I can to treat you like a rose
Yeah, but you even give better treatment to that girl
Named Selina from uptown like a Daisy
You even gave her some of your special donuts for free
So this is what this is all about, huh? Donuts
No, Pos, can't you hear the music, it's all about 'Hey Love'
Look I don't understand why you're dissing me
It's not like I'm Paul, I don't have two kids in every state
But you probably got two girls in every state
If you're not going to go about it the way I want you to
Then just leave, 'cause I can't be so bothered
Yeah and wit your wrinkled pussy
I can't be your lover
Where's that voice coming from?
From, from nowhere
