Ooh, I see guys and girls dancin', ooh, ooh
Now as the record spins around, you recognize this sound
Well, it's the Underground,
You know that we're down with wutchyalike
Yeah, with wutchyalike, yeah
And though we're usually on the serious tip, check it out
Tonight we're gonna flip and trip and let it all hang out tonight
We're gonna say what we like
'Cause, yo, yo, we wanna know how many people in the flow
Would like to just let yourselves go and doowutchyalike
Yeah, well tonight's your night
Just eat food, try not to be crude or rude
Kill the attitude, chill the serious mood
And doowutchyalike
Yeah, and doowutchyalike, everybody doowutchyalike
Ooh, I see guys and girls dancin', ooh, ooh
Yeah, doowutchyalike
Ooh, I see guys and girls dancin', ooh, ooh

Ooh, I see guys and girls dancin', ooh, ooh
Yo, go whereyalike
Ooh, I see, I see, I see guys and girls dancin', ooh, ooh
I mean rich, poor, high, low, or upper-middle class
Let's all get together and have a few laughs
And do what we like
Yeah, and do what we like, yeah
And since you came here you gotta show and prove
And do that dance, until it don't move
Doowutchyalike
Sometimes I bite
Now if you're hungry, get yourself something to eat
And if you're dirty, then go take a bath
Messed up the line?
Nope, sometimes I don't rhyme
Help yourself to a cracker, with a spread of cheddar cheese
Have a neck bone, you don't have to say please
Eat wutch ya like, yo, smell how ya like
Everybody doowutchyalike
Ooh, I see guys and girls dancin', ooh, ooh
Doowutchyalike
Ooh, I see guys and girls dancin', ooh, ooh
Yo, doowutchyalike, you know what I'm sayin'?
Ooh, I see guys and girls dancin', ooh, ooh
  (Whatever you like to do, talk how ya like)
Ooh, I see, I see, I see guys and girls dancin', ooh, ooh
Just act a fool, it's okay if you drool
'Cause everybody's gonna strip, and jump in the pool
And do what we like, yeah, and do what we like
Homegirls, for once, forget you got class
See a guy you like, just grab 'em in the biscuits
And doowutchyalike
Now, red, white, black, tan, yellow, or brown
It really doesn't matter, we can all get down
And do what we like, yeah, and do what we like
From a pink-skinned yankee, to a blue black southerner
Ditch digger or a governor
Just doowutchyalike
Look how ya like
Now don't you know we're gettin' busy, it can't be corrected
[Incomprehensible] had to be deaf
I say what I like
Like I said, sometimes we bite
Even though you don't think it's right, yo, I like to bite
Just havin' fun y'all, and if you think that it's wrong
You got to admit, it's a new type of song
Doowutchyalike
Ooh, I see guys and girls dancin', ooh, ooh
Yeah, doowutchyalike
Ooh, I see guys and girls dancin', ooh, ooh
Yo, go where ya like
Ooh, I see guys and girls dancin', ooh, ooh
Yo, do who ya like

Feel wutch ya like
Eat wutch ya like
Scratch where ya like
Itch if ya like
Daddy, can I go outside?
Huh, go where ya like, kid
A brief announcement to all radio DJ's
If this record is currently being played at your station
We will provide the following time for you
To announce your station identification
We'd also like to add that we've now reached
The three-and-a-half minute mark of this song
Radio stations may begin your fade here
For those that would like help, we will start your fade for you
Now if this record is being played at a club, disco
Lounge, house, basement, or block party
Car stereo, stoop, or at any other social gathering
We will now allow the beat to continue
And proceed to give you more of what you like
This message has been brought to you by the makers of
The Way We Swing, and the Underground Talkhowyalike Posse
I feel like a nice big bowl of cereal, icy cold milk
Daddy, can I eat some ice cream?
Look, I told you kid, eat wutch ya like, okay?
Now the beat goes on 'til the break of dawn
And just peep this, y'all, 'cause we're singin' a song
And doowutchyalike, yeah doowutchyalike
And since you came here you gotta show and prove
And do that dance, until it don't move, and doowutchyalike
Like I said, sometimes we bite, now we're all gettin' stupid
And actin' a fool, anything that ya really wanna do is cool
So, Goldfingers, cut wutch ya like
Now if you're hungry, get yourself something to eat
And if you're dirty, then go take a bath
And doowutchyalike
Stetsasonics, adjust for the hip hop fans
And since we're not your average everyday rap band
Yo, Piano Man, play how ya like
Just act a fool, it's okay if you drool
Everybody's gonna strip, and jump in the pool
An' what, wait a minute, wait a minute
Don't take your clothes off yet, not yet
Wait 'til we get home
Now if you wear corrective shoes and you got big bunions
Toenails smell and look like onions, don't doowutchyalike
Go see a foot doctor tonight
Everybody doowutchyalike
Ooh, I see guys and girls dancin', ooh, ooh
Yeah, doowutchyalike
Ooh, ooh, I see guys and girls dancin', ooh, ooh
Just doowutchyalike
Ooh, ooh, I see, I see, I see guys and girls dancin', ooh, ooh
Everybody doowutchyalike
Ooh, ooh, I see guys and girls dancin', ooh, ooh
Straight hair, curled, casual and glamor
A shy girl, or loud like a bama
From Connecticut, or from Louisiana
Bad table etiquette, too much chatter
Very well spoken, or real bad grammar
I minority token, a brother in the slammer
A free civilian with a house in Santa Ana
If ya got a million, and live in Atlanta
If you got a weak bladder, or can't climb a ladder
What we're sayin' is, it really doesn't matter
I need a word that sounds like 'atta'
Slipped on a peel of banana, doowutchyalike
Yeah, cool, gettin' stupid
Once again you got the sound of the Underground
Baby Dope is in the house
Boy, yea, are we puttin' things in check, Baby D?
Too stupid check
I'm wit' it, yea, yo Dave
Let's show 'em some old school
It makes no sense just standin' around
Come on everybody, let's all hang out
Yeah, and doowutwelike
From a lime to a lemon, a lemon to a lime
Come on, young ladies, let's have good times
And doowutwelike
Now, I can sing, I can dance, I'm the king of romance
Are you sweet young ladies gonna give me a chance
To doowutchyalike?
And get that thing packed tonight
Vanessa Williams, ooh, you're so divine
Just wanted to put your name in my rhyme
And doowutchyalike
Yeah, everybody doowutchyalike
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
I see, I see, I see guys and girls dancin'
I see, I see, I see, I see guys and girls dancin'
I see, I see, I see, I see, I see guys and girls dancin'
I see, I see, I see, I see guys and girls dancin'
End the record how we like
