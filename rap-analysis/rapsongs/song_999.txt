As we approach the current time frame of 1997
With approximately two and a half years before the year 2000
Repeatedly it has been reported that
There will be a time soon approaching
That a major disaster will be striking all levels of existence
It has also been reported that this disastrous thing will be
Approaching in the form of many, many as in squad
Squad as in Flipmode Squad
It has also been reported that everyone out of the many will strike
But this particular motherfucker will strike with an unmeasurable blast
That will fuck up everything within it's 360 degree radius
Warning, prepare yourselves, store your food, stamp your paper
Because when this motherfucker gets here
It's about to get real fucked up for everyone and everything
Everywhere!

See now, Dolomite just got back from some shit that you about to be it
Well, are you prepared? I hope you are prepared nigga

There'll be more bitches, more and more and more
More thirsty niggas, tryin' to get inside your shit
Tryin' to throw your whole chemistry off
Oh yes, there's gonna be a lot more money
Yes a lot more money than before
So son, don't you worry about none of that shit
All you gotta do is just slap your dick
In the mouth of these bitches that don't wanna act right
And put a hot one in any motherfucker
That wants to get in the way of this powerful shit right here
