Def squad, Wu Tang
Check it, check it out, check it, check it out
Check it, check it out, check it, check it out
Check it, check it out, check it, check it out
Check it, check it out, check it, check it out
Call us gorillas in the myst, raunchy vocalist
Your code name? Doc, whats yo' name? Hot nix
Who them slick kids puffin' that shit holdin' their dicks?
Yo them same two drivin' your whip fuckin' your bitch
Hold me down son, yo, I hold you down with the pound
You got a lot of biscuits, ayo but where they at now?
Diggy down yo we reservoir dogs, you puppy chow chow
Got my mittens on the kitten, lickin' it now now
Yo we bring the beef to you, infest it with the Mad Cow
Disease, we set to load, cock and squeeze
Booya! We too hard to hold off
One, arm slam ya like Nicoli Volkov
When I dip dip dappa dappa the anti-socializa
Everything be ice cream observe the [Incomprehensible]
We rock ya, knock ya fuckin' whole team off the roster
Starting lineup, Iron Lung, the funk docta
Don't fuck with the big dogs, don't fuck with the big dogs
Don't fuck with the big dogs, don't fuck with the big dogs
Johnny blaze the ghost rider, ghost stories by the campfire
We night breed vampire! Duckin' from the head rushin'
Wu Tang production, percussions bringin' repercussions
I hold my mic sideways bustin'
Another one bites the dust and
Cardiac arrest clutchin' your chest suckin'
Your last breath, in awe, period Meth
Nigga, dyin' from paper cuts, bleedin' to death
Down these mean streets Johnny Quest
From ASCAP to NASDAQ get that money sack
These habitats ain't no place to raise family at
These alley cats be at war with these dirty rats
So watch you back when you come to the slum
There ain't nowhere to run from the Iron Lizard Lung
Blazes on stunts, I be dippin' in the sun
My plates bear so on, my uzi weighs a ton, word up
Don't fuck with the big dogs, don't fuck with the big dogs
Don't fuck with the big dogs, don't fuck with the big dogs
Check it, check it out, check it, check it out
Check it, check it out, check it, check it out
Pon cocked, the Don Juan doc send crews back to the shoe shine box
Connect the dots, my description, black Mel, yellow da mellow
I make it hard for MC's to run neck and elbow
With D O Penal code
We both knows to duck when he hear the bike
Wit the squeaky clutch
Swallow this hard act to follow
You could parachute off my slang and use my rhymes to toggle
I'm tense, so smooth I can't be fingerprinted
I stomp harder in slow motion [Incomprehensible]
Yo, fuck your applaud
Bitches still rush me like they rushed the store
Before the Soul Train Awards
Incorporate a law
Whoever ain't raw get they hand chopped
By Jamal with the Wu sword
My crew specializin' snakin' your bitch
Robbin' you while you on the floor shakin' your shit
I'm doin' me now I'll do you
Yo who you? Doc
I bomb shit through the conflicts crucial
I be da black El Nino, I mean yo
I'm supreme like the team show
With the pay to cream for
To see you sit down
Yo, na, we get the fuck up
And leave the one you wit then take off of Usher
That's right, six double O with chrome pipes
U.S. Marshals out to pen us up like snipes
Throw it in drive, fuck takin' me and Meth alive
Yo, you look that a way
You look out the other side, yeah, yeah
