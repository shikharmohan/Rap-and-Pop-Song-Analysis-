Ain't no California love
I see them niggaz
You see them niggaz?
I see them niggaz
Look at them niggaz just waitin' to hate
Waitin' to hate, waitin' to hate
Look at them bitches just waitin' to hate
Waitin' to hate, waitin' to hate
Get your ride on, ride on
This ain't the day for you to die on, die on
I'm a nigga that they lie on, lie on
See these shoes you wanna try on, try on
Yo, we can go to war with the enemy
All we need is AK's and Hennessy
This ain't back in the days of Tennessee
Pull the trigger and release the energy
See muthafuckas run till they catch one
In the back and it might cause a cardiac
Bitch act like he died and we brought him back
Him screamin' for his mama and his sister pack
Flat line, these niggaz wanna act like
They ain't never had a full can of act-right
Make me pull out my gat, right
And smoke his muthafuckin' ass like a crack pipe
So what you sayin', muthafucka?
We ain't playin', muthafucka
AK'n muthafuckas
So what you sayin', muthafucka?
We ain't playin', muthafucka
AK'n muthafuckas
Look at them niggaz just waitin' to hate
Waitin' to hate, waitin' to hate
Look at them bitches just waitin' to hate
Waitin' to hate, waitin' to hate
Get your smoke on, smoke on
Here's another verse to choke on, choke on
To all my niggaz in the pen, get your yoke on
To all my thugs in the house, get your loc on
We can really give a fuck about a broke home
All we care about is bitches we can poke on
Nigga, what's that bullshit that you spoke on?
Better roll on 'fore we split your whole dome
'Cause you're fuckin' with Ice Cube the Terrible
Fuck around, I make your life unbearable
Make you live all scary and careful
Come through my neighborhood, you better tip-toe
'Cause if you loud, then you might get chased down
Westside Connection catch a case now
Po-po's find your monkey ass face down
Tell your mama that you in a better place now
So what you sayin', muthafucka?
We ain't playin', muthafucka
AK'n muthafuckas
So what you sayin', muthafucka?
We ain't playin', muthafucka
AK'n muthafuckas
Look at them niggaz just waitin' to hate
Waitin' to hate, waitin' to hate
Look at them bitches just waitin' to hate
Waitin' to hate, waitin' to hate
Ain't no California love
You can hate me now
Ain't no California love
To all my niggaz with the lleyo
They rock it up like Play-Doh
They cook it up like Waco, better do what I say so
Better lay low, 'cause you fuckin' with a halo
Death to the niggaz with the big mouth
And death to you devils from the Old South
And death to you hoes turnin' tricks out
And death everyone that go the bitch route
Check it, if you infected by this record
Bow down butt-naked and pray to God
Ice Cube won't spare the rod
Westside Connection here to mob, nigga, rob
We can take it to the streets
We can take it to the concrete
You niggaz know where the Don be
You bitches ain't tryin' to find me
All you haters need to shut the fuck up and get behind me
Look at them niggaz just waitin' to hate
Waitin' to hate, waitin' to hate
Look at them bitches just waitin' to hate
Waitin' to hate, waitin' to hate
So what you sayin', muthafucka?
We ain't playin', muthafucka
AK'n muthafuckas
So what you sayin', muthafucka?
We ain't playin', muthafucka
AK'n muthafuckas
This is dedicated to them haters
Who ain't gon' kill nothin'
And who ain't gon' let nothin' die
You know 'em, you know 'em
When you see Ice Cube you better holla
And pop a collar
When you see Ice Cube you better holla
And pop a collar
