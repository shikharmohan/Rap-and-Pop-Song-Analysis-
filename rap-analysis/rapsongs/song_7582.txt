Shit man, fuck
Drivers license and registration please
Hey what's up, sir, ah, look ah
Sir, could you please step out the car
Oh, not a problem, officer, it's all good
I'm just, you know I'm sayin'
Come here to drop my lil boy off
At my, baby momma house
On the way here, you know
Here go my license right here, okay
Trunk full of yoda, heated situation
Flashlight in ma eyes, he want ma registration, what?
Should I stay, should I run?
Got hard, got soft, got pills, got guns for real
My driver's license is revoked
Just got done burnin' so I know he smell the smoke, damn
But never let 'em see you see sweat
'Cause if he search your trunk, he might find the tec
Or a bag full of O's, wrapped in duct tape
Nigga, between some dirty ass clothes
But I talk to him the right way,
He told me, slow it down and have a nice day
You can do your thing, shawty, it's okay to floss
But it's still one rule, player don't get caught
'Cause everythin' you gain, dog and everythin' you lost
But it's still one rule, pimpin' don't get caught
For every hoe you hit, dog and every hoe you toss
'Cause it's still one rule, player don't get caught
And you can ride clean, shorty you ain't gotta walk
But it's still one rule, player don't get caught
Some niggas rob, what, some niggas slang, for real
Some niggas stack, naw some niggas bang, chill
But I congratulate not playa hate
You in the streets pimpin', make ya move, get ya cake
Fuck what you heard through the grapevine
Get outta line, nigga, I'ma straighten mine
And I don't believe in wastin' time
Well, catch them hoes later, stay on ya grind, that's right
Gotta a low tolerance for ignorance, ignorance
You thinkin' pleasure I'm thinkin' business
The streets didn't raise no fool
When you live by the code, nigga it's only one rule
You can do your thing, shawty, it's okay to floss
But it's still one rule, player don't get caught
'Cause everything you gain, dog and everythin' you lost
But it's still one rule, pimpin' don't get caught
For every hoe you hit, dog and every hoe you toss
'Cause it's still one rule, player don't get caught
You can ride clean, shorty you ain't gotta walk
But it's still one rule, player don't get caught
Got the phone call, had a funny feelin', feelin'
Told him everythin' was cool and I was chillin', chillin'
We use to chill out and smoke blunts
And I ain't seen him in a while maybe a couple months
Said he wanna holler, he seemed anxious
First thing on ma mind, is go and get the strainers
Make his folks pay a ransom 'bout him
On that bullshit make a good example out him
This nigga high, he on fire, fire
I hope his ass ain't wearin' no wire
Naw dog, you bullshittin'
Said his partner set him up, tha nigga snitchin'
You can do your thing, shawty, it's okay to floss
But it's still one rule, player don't get caught
'Cause everything you gain, dog and everything you lost
But it's still one rule, pimpin' don't get caught
For every hoe you hit, dog and every hoe you toss
'Cause it's still one rule, player don't get caught
You can ride clean, shorty you ain't gotta walk
But it's still one rule, player don't get caught
You can do your thing, shawty, it's okay to floss
But it's still one rule, player don't get caught
'Cause everything you gain, dog and everythin' you lost
But it's still one rule, pimpin' don't get caught
For every hoe you hit, dog and every hoe you toss
'Cause it's still one rule, player don't get caught
You can ride clean, shorty you ain't gotta walk
But it's still one rule, player don't get caught
