You don't want no problems, problems
You don't want no problems, problems
Yeah, real man with ya stinking ass
Come on, that's my nigga right there, let's do it
Never count me out, nigga, just count me in
Look, I ain't came to bone these chicks
Not this time, I got a bone to pick, I got a zone to pick
Now, who that nigga up in the zone and shit?
Back in the building like he own the bitch
Nobody cold as this, if I ain't got it, then it don't exist
I spit that bird flu, my flows is sick, I'm still as ill as they come
Protect ya neck, when you dealing with them
Now Erick, stick a fork in him, he done, hah
It boggle's the mind, like trying to ketchup to a bottle of Heinz
It's like forensics trying to follow the crime, they want time
And sometime, a nigga had to swallow them dimes
While 85 percent swallowing swine
See wherever he roam, it's all gravy, man, whatever he own
Long as I got myself a Marilyn loan, Phillies are better chrome
If there's a problem, nigga, let it be known
And while I sleep, my bitch be checking my phone
'Cause I'm a problem, nigga
Ease up, or put them G's up
Scream at ya frog, nigga, leap up
Now who got a problem with that?
They need to beast up, need to speak up
Or forever hold they peace up
If they got a problem with that

Look, my Clan all one and the same
Until my name number one in the game, it's not a game, nigga
Like Billy Danze, I be running with fame
Me and my lynch mob coming to hang, it's Wu-Tang for life
Hard body, another day in the life
Credit his momma now for raising him right
Just want the people to know, I'm 'bout to blow
Like I'm shaking the dice, making me mad?
Nah, y'all making me right 'cause y'all was taking me light
So let my pen talk and say what he like
And have the court system say and indite, I'm O.J. in the mic
Liquid plumber, I be laying the pipe
And if it's tight, girl, I'm staying tonight
Not only raising on the price, on MC'ing, but I'm raising the bar
And if you scary, nigga, wait in the car
Motherfuckers, I'm hard, hard as cooked up in mayonnaise jars
Purple haze, Cuban made cigars, I'm a problem, nigga
Ease up, or put them G's up
Scream at ya frog, nigga, leap up
Now who got a problem with that?

Or forever hold they peace up

If they busting, I better bust right back
'Meth spit it from the guts like
Man down, I'm that dude, hands down, stare down
I'm past due for cash rule, y'all can't clown
