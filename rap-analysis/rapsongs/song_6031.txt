Ooh, Think of the weekend love
Watch this
Weekend love
Gonna spend a weekend love
Weekend love
Just a case of weekend love
If you've been misled by anything I said
Didn't mean to turn you on, but the vibe was oh, so strong
And you got things to do when I have got things too
So I'll catch you on the weekend
Mondays to Fridays, I don't see you then
A WEEK and a END
And a LOVE we were meant to be
A WEEK, a END
LOVE, we were meant to be
Weekend love
Gonna spend a weekend love
Weekend love
Just a case of weekend love
Seems it's been so long
Since you thrilled me with your charms
I tenderly imagine me resting in your arms
You've got things to do when I have got things too
So I'll catch you on the weekend
Mondays to Fridays, I don't see you then
Because we're sorry when we part and we love when we meet
I know we only do that only once in a week
Sorry when we part and we love when we meet
I know we only do that only once in a week
I know, you know, we all occupied
From our own love life things has been denied
Many feelin's hide, many tears I've cried
But by the weekend let my spirit divide
Weekend love
Gonna spend a weekend love
Weekend love
Just a case of weekend love
If you've been misled by anything I've said
I didn't mean to turn you on but the vibe was oh, so strong
And you've got things to do when I have got things too
So I'll catch you on the weekend
Mondays to Fridays, I don't see you then
A WEEK and a END
LOVE we were meant to be
A WEEK, a END
LOVE we were meant to be
When we are absent, that is a plus 100 percent
To nourish and cherish every moment
To deliver the goods I am efficient
And I know you're possessed with the ingredients
During the week the days seems to be long
But on the weekend I wish I could reverse it's time
Great things can come in a small bag
So let's make use of the time that we have
When we are together 'cause we stay popular
If we never miss a second of the hour
When we are together I sit and I wonder
If this love is gonna last forever?
Well, then I think and I start remember
That we are a judge star
Weekend love
Gonna spend a weekend love
Weekend love
Just a case of weekend love
