Good luck, time to get hood stuck
Caldasac trap, Mr. Good Stuff, Ludacris give me 20 push-ups
Last summer, got da hook up, you know what I did
Who'd eva thought up they grew up on one of the bebe kids
Type of rat, sat on my ass and fiendin' for cash
Almost got signed with Puff Puff, but I think I'll pass
Now what we got up 'round here is some 20-20 twins
And whats up in my hand, is a bottle of gin
I love women so I'm in it to win it, in it to green
In it to get in it and get in it again, you got two booties
So you whippin' yo chin and I don't blame you I lay in da sand
Ya'll lay in da snow and make angels
My ice piece dangle, make my chest look older
Touch it and fall apart like yo high school folder
I'm a Trojan man, B.H.S hall supplier
Shady park resident and southside rider

Get back, time to get hood jacked, gold chain, took dat
World of ghetto fabulous dopeboys and hoodrats
Be careful what you look at 'cause you lookin' to long
You might go blind in my briefs 'cause my dick is too long
I'm gettin' nutt while I'm singin' this song and there is enough
For everybody in da party, while ya'll hittin' da bong
But ya'll be hittin' my schlong, you play the flute quite nicely
When teeth interrupt, you can watch as I get fiesty
Oh, no, you suckas didn't request back up
Broads I seem to rack up when I pull da gold acta
Get slapped up, drove up da wall, put it in reverse
You can hope for the best, but expect the worst
You at a place like some d's on a hurst
Its quite funny, phat rabbit, playboy bunny
It seems as if that's what I'll need, filthy south and d's
Thats why I roll in from da southside breeze, give it to me now

Your pick time to get hood sick, hit 'em wit a good lick
Clean out yo house from da couch to da toothpick
Eastside ruthless, westside leave 'em clueless
My northside mackers got dis broads actin' foolish
And do this for a living while you stuck up in yo cubicle
Nightlife runnin' dis streets, it sounds beautiful
Women break a cuticle, Ballas break bread
Southside, I represent it till I'm dead, what, wha?
