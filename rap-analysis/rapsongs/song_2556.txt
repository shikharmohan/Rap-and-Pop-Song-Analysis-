What y'all niggaz want?
(What we want, right?)
Can't touch, uh
All y'all niggaz need
(What we need in our life?)
Is right here
Rubia huh? Papi screamin' out of they mouth
Bombshell, just a second mami, wanna speak out
What I need in my life, make ya body freak out
Baby seem like the type, married niggaz sneak out
Like I'm ballin' y'all, yes I be appallin' y'all
Boss type hold it down, wantin' all of y'all
Callin' y'all never chasin' me down
Three weeks, heartbroken, yes you hatin' me now
She speaks, soft spoken 'til she datin' the clown
I'm takin' 'em down, reel 'em in and makin' 'em drown
Mistake, I said gimme, bet I'm takin' it now
What I need from a nigga negative in his sound
Audacity, even, askin' me
For ass, I laugh, this bitch is fast and free
Swattin' 'em off when I see this nigga's a flea
Plottin' of course for riches, millionaire wannabe, uh, huh
Whether you're in Cuba, Puerto Rico, Republica Dominicana
Venezuela, Mexico, everywhere tell me, what you want?
Guatemala, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Ecuador, Colombia
Everywhere tell me, what you want?
Popular since I started my life
Eve you know my name, probably the dangerous type
Brick house stallion, think you tamin' me right?
Not this baby Del-Philly streets they raisin' her right
Keep it pretty or can make it gritty be a lady
Need boots pocket books and a baby 380
But prefer to keep it, calm and cool
When I'm heated I suggest you move
Just avoid a bad situation, what you got to prove?
Leave her be, chicken squakin' hatin' frequently
Mad they man is obsessed and stalkin' me
If he, icy enough, I'm pricin' his stuff
Be nicy enough, to let him spend, I'm callin' ya bluff
Puttin' it down, Ruff Ryders put in they work
Snatched up the illest viscous Pitbull in a skirt
Makin' em hurt, haters steady dishin' up dirt
Changin' the game, settin' the rules, makin' it work, uh
Whether you're in Cuba, Puerto Rico, Republica Dominicana
Venezuela, Mexico, everywhere tell me, what you want?
Guatemala, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Ecuador, Colombia
Everywhere tell me, what you want?
Leavin' 'em scared, mami takin' all of this here
All of this fame, I'm hungry hope you cats is prepared
Niggaz, set me up and I'ma take it and run
Think it's a game? Just check out how my format is done
Stoppin' your shine and I do it to perfection
Made a promise every time I touch the mic to bless 'em
Used to tease me how I keep is greasy just to test 'em
Eve handcuff niggaz but I don't arrest 'em
Shorty-bang hear the niggaz singin', shoutin' my name
Make the thuggish niggaz scream, watchin' me entertain
Dicks brick when I lick the lips, just keepin' it plain
Fantasizin' 'bout this bitch, got 'em goin' insane
Ooh's and ah's, 5'7" thick in the thighs
Every thugs dream wife, see the love in they eyes?
My time to shine, whole package make her a dime
Want some more? It ain't over, just keep pressin' rewind, uh
