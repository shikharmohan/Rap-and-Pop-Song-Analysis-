I would teach the world to be a thug in harmony
(Thug in harmony)
Gather souls get up, get up and let us move on, move on
Maybe some could follow if their hearts were not so cold, so cold
Come and picture for the family scripture
[Incomprehensible]
Tell me what do ya see? Club nigga in a mask, a man tryin' to blast ass
Do you know what it means? To just leave us, leave us, leave us alone
You know we put you in the, no bone in we pretender

Nigga won't be fuckin' with no hands in the nine style
And all the way to heavens that's my mission
Standin' up ready for the war in position
When the shit jump niggas won't be slippin'
Niggas fallin' victim, really what's happenin'
I'm a victim just 'cuz I'm rappin'
Stackin' my cheese that I'm always packin'
Niggas with nothin' to lose be cappin'
And I really don't blame you, motherfuckers, its true
What goes around, comes around, since I did, what I did
In the past, get a pipe and a chance an' I'm ready to throw down
Low down, dirty mothafuckin' shame, in a world so cruel
It's niggas like you, who just be disrespectin' the game
Before I had a little money, niggas what's hatin' me just for nothin'
Breakin' my gear and thinkin' its funny
Get around bitches an' niggas be frontin
But I'm just hustlin', strugglin', jumpin', with a lot of frustrations
Livin' in a nation of playa hation, with a fucked up situation
