Y'all been eatin' long enough, now stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real partner, give to the needy
Grips is touchy, so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gonna bite you an' snatch the plate
I could flip that flow, I could stick that hoe
I can get that dough, you know I'm with that Jo
An' the thing about the shit I came through, I haven't seen
But when it gets dark, it's like a nigga's havin' dreams
All nightmares, the light dares to desert me
Got me like everybody wants to hurt me
Paranoid, so I strike out at whatever
The closest thing to me is gonna get it
But, never will I, can I think death is wrong
So I'm a keep holdin' on till what's left is gone
You could put that on my nigga bone
These other rap cats will give a nigga room
But if it calls for me to force my way in the door
Headhuntin' mother fuckers, stay on the floor
Four, four, that's what I get sick wit'
Four more, now all this is liquid
Y'all been eatin' long enough, now stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real partner, give to the needy
Grips is touchy, so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gonna bite you an' snatch the plate
Y'all been eatin' long enough, now stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real partner, give to the needy
Grips is touchy, so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gonna bite you an' snatch the plate
I thank the lord everyday that I'm blessed with a gift
I'm the best, so, unless you wanna rest with the stiff
Don't touch that, leave it alone
When you walk past the dog house, leave it a bone
Dogs bite, dogs fight, dogs knife
Scratch, shake and hold all night
So when you hear the, arf arf, start runnin'
'Cause when you hear the, arf arf, I'm comin
But I don't like drama, so I stay to myself
Keep focus with this rap shit and pray for the wealth
I want the money and give me the honeys with big asses
The most expensive champagne you got in big glasses
I'm drunk so I'm a bash his head wide open
Beggin' me to stop but at least he died hopin'
Didn't get his wish, and now he's a dish with a cat
Two glowin' red eyes, everything else black
Y'all been eatin' long enough, now stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real partner, give to the needy
Grips is touchy, so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gonna bite you an' snatch the plate
Y'all been eatin' long enough, now stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real partner, give to the needy
Grips is touchy, so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gonna bite you an' snatch the plate
When the sun is up, the gun is up on the shelf
And all the runners up are thankin' me for their help
Hopin' that they not around when it gets dark outside
Sun's goin' down you hear the bark outside
Locks off the cage, gauge, with the buck shots, faggot
You've been lucky all day this is where your luck stops
One drops and another and another
Gun pops, go into you and your mother
When does it all end, I found a friend in a dog
'Cause fuckin' wit' these cats will send a friend to the morgue
Many questions, no answers, just stress
Try to hold my head and remember that I'm blessed
If you curse and it gets worse, time goes by
Can't see straight 'cause I'm so high
Why ask why when you know?
Nigga when its your time to go, you go
Y'all been eatin' long enough, now stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real partner, give to the needy
Grips is touchy, so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gonna bite you an' snatch the plate
Y'all been eatin' long enough, now stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real partner, give to the needy
Grips is touchy, so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gonna bite you an' snatch the plate
Y'all been eatin' long enough, now stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real partner, give to the needy
Grips is touchy, so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gonna bite you an' snatch the plate
Y'all been eatin' long enough, now stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real partner, give to the needy
Grips is touchy, so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gonna bite you an' snatch the plate
