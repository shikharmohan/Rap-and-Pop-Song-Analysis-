Victory won in a worlds of Hennessey and guns
Too young for the marches but I remember these drums
To start reality of wars and battles we fought for ours
Caught in ghetto tragedy
I talk to my aunt named Mattie Lee
And recognize the importance of family
Hand me a joint, good music and room to breathe
Those that doubt Com' will soon believe
Can't trust the weave, my lady had one
I'm more like a fool for soul and passion
The price of gas rises, street life is pumpin' fast
Lives is I'm watch [Incomprehensible]
And realize that we all survivors
No religion or race, whatever describe us
My guys do dirt, do dirt but never really talk about it
Forever begins just because I thought about it
Livin' once again
We livin' then you go
Livin' then you go
Livin' then you go
Livin' then you go
Ashes and snowfalls, I wonder when the roll call
For heaven gon' come, forever gon' come
It's a cold world and I can never go numb
Look fear in the eyes, say I'm never gon' run
Sooner or later I know the cheddar gon' come
For now I write the world letters to better the young
On tree by jury, together we hung
Now we let our chains hang and gang bang to maintain
'Ghanastan goin' through the same thing
It trickles down at each other, we aim pain
I shoot for stars, peace and exclusive cars
Through the while I learned to earn hard
Watch gangstas turn God into Mr. War
No matter how much I elevate, I kiss the floor
It was in the van when she said Dilla was gone
That's when I knew we'd live forever through song
Livin' once again
We livin' then you go
Livin' then you go
Livin' then you go
Livin' then you go
Livin' once again
We livin' then you go
Livin' then you go
Livin' then you go
Livin' then you go
Livin' when we livin' then you go
Livin' then you go
You go, you go
Then you go, you go
Origin is forever
Well, well well, here we are back in the studio again
Look at that, hey, I don't need no cue cards
They got the engineers holdin' up cue cards
What's that say, what that say?
Oh they say 'Just talk, don't sing'
Son, I bet you feel like
You and I've been here forever
Thirty years old red eyes, beholdin' red eyes
I see my world's tears, yeah, origin is forever
Every peak will have two valleys
Hopeful eyes in the comfort of true protection
And admiration of the chime, that's forever
Forever is to strive the pace of endearment
Forever, forever is what I'd leave
My I self contribution, damn, what I'm gon' leave?
Okay, I leave my one and only grain of spiritual sand
To the universal scales of humanity, all humanity
Forever is findin' a solution to a solution
Tsunamis, hurricanes, followin' the trails of the African slave ships
War, war and more war
Floods, Columbine, global warming, earthquakes
Another somebody done me wrong, son
Virginia Tech, there's not a oh, what the heck
We're still, did you place your one grain
Of spiritual sand forever?
Confusion need a solution, blend and stir, stir and blend
The part of humanity, sip the ingredients of acknowledgment
Apology, amendment, atonement
We gonna work with the four A's here, forever part
Common good is forever, God's memory is forever
