Stop touching the fucking door, man
You so fucking paranoid man
What's the matter wit' you man?
It's like a nigga could write for hours and get real
Theatrical wit' this, understand? Tellin' you kid
I got stripes when it comes to this right here
Y'all know my repertoire, it's dangerous, and the cats I roll
Wit' is dangerous and they ain't your regular average cats
Here we go, yeah
Aea yo, it's all elegance
He spoke third power style high intelligence
A young man handle the game like Merill Lynch
3 a.m. breathin', leanin' in gates
I mean creaming, selling these cakes
In slabs like Lanolakes, fiends beamin', steamin'
Associated wit' names and demons
All apparent reasons
We live here the gate blew in a year
Sorta like time share where crime
Sport it like I shine, yeah, rainbow dough was the emmo
So many flavors, yo buy your neighbor off underwater vault
Then I met him, Colombian name Flako
Had the whole block locked sellin' tons in Morocco
Wristwatch Fachera Costanti, nigga dead up
Sniff the rawest mist mixed wit' 7 Up
Had a black wiz spoke German, higher learnin' burnin'
Ask Vernon got a bed set bought a black jet
Bitch large percentage on her rich motor lodge
Lost her arm, shot with a AK up in the south
Paramedics rocked her, said she had connections out of Antartica
Barrels of juices from Florida
Can't forget live dusthead centerfoldin'
Out in Club Med butt ass layin' like she dead
Wise guys fell for her ambiance, pull it together, Black Renassaince
Queen Elizabeth aunt, crazy swift cristal murderer
Guzzle the shit like she dyin' kid, showing off her diamond
Flashbacks now it's me and him again, last word I caught
Put your money in we could have the shit bumpin'
That's federalo music, I caught the glimpse from the bitch
When she winched, yeah, Santa a grinch
She blinked twitched her nose then froze
Check your Rolls by the blow, it's time to roll nigga let's go
I thought about it, broke the money down
What's the total, count it, no count it over in the mix
Day goin' slower, nope, not time to motor
He estimated over me not being a crook
Count it over, you're only on the strength of my man
We ain't hit him with the strong hand
Gun him down leave him out in flatlands
He backhand smacked her, threw her on the table, jacked her
I broke out in laughter fifteen minutes after
Police knocked on the door, looked out the window of my room
As your, nigga, yeah that's yours
He opened up the door this nigga wildin', his bitch is in shock
Start smilin' and speakin' on Valen, you wisen up bitch this from the rich
Immobilize the game get your name right, envelope came hype
Regards from the Mayor, you hype fuck right
Let's fuck this money up and get large and blow outta sight
Wise niggas wake up, dead niggas lose
Who you gon' choose, me or him?
You a fool, pay attention, fuck around, meet the tension
See you in the next dimension, y'all niggas didn't listen
Wise niggas wake up, dead niggas lose
Who you gon' choose, me or him?
You a fool, pay attention, fuck around, meet the tension
See you in the next dimension, y'all niggas didn't listen
Wise niggas wake up, dead niggas lose
You a fool, pay attention, fuck around, meet the tension
See you in the next dimension, y'all niggas didn't listen
Wise niggas wake up
