Akon, and E-40, yeah
I know you ain't used to havin' real niggas like me around
I'm here to change your whole life girl, so you don't deal with clowns
And treat you like a superstar that you are
Cause I'm a superstar too and I know
Exactly what I must do to make you
Feel! I'm about to wake it up
Feel! See I'm about to wake it up
Feel! I'm about to wake it up
Don't it feel so good girl?
Feel! I'm about to wake it up
Feel! See I'm about to wake it up
Feel! I'm about to wake it up
Don't it feel so good girl?
I keep it 100's, don't carry nothing but 100's
I'm trying to wake it up, I'm on your line like Vonage
I'm a real one, ma, get rid of that clown, get with a factor
Patna don't count, he a lame, he don't matter
Shining like the big dipper, glowing like a star
Lookin up a paw, pullin up in my car
Walked right up to the front where the bosses park at
I got a cold mouthpiece, can talk a chick out her check
Security loves me, let me in with no sweat
I see Asian persuasion, Caucasian, all kinds of chicks
Milk skin, chocolate boned, lambs and Haitians
Tryna take me something home and have some relation
I know you ain't used to havin' real niggas like me around
I'm here to change your whole life girl, so you don't deal with clowns
And treat you like a superstar that you are
Cause I'm a superstar too and I know
Exactly what I must do to make you
Feel! I'm about to wake it up
Feel! See I'm about to wake it up
Feel! I'm about to wake it up
Don't it feel so good girl?
Feel! I'm about to wake it up
Feel! See I'm about to wake it up
Feel! I'm about to wake it up
Don't it feel so good girl?
Good God Almighty! Look at that body
Ma you holdin'! Girl you a banger!
You ain't off the back porch, you're off the hanger!
You working with something, you gotta personal trainer?
Whole crew fine but you're one of a kind
You a ten piece, shawty you a dime
Back that thang up, baby press rewind
I'm a Scorpio, Shawty what's your sign?
I'm just tryna know you, hold a conversation
Spoil you a lil', lightweight cupcakin'
Spend a lil gouda, get your hair done up
I'm a show you how a tycoon wake that thang up!
I know you ain't used to havin' real niggas like me around
I'm here to change your whole life girl, so you don't deal with clowns
And treat you like a superstar that you are
Cause I'm a superstar too and I know
Exactly what I must do to make you
Feel! I'm about to wake it up
Feel! See I'm about to wake it up
Feel! I'm about to wake it up
Don't it feel so good girl?
Feel! I'm about to wake it up
Feel! See I'm about to wake it up
Feel! I'm about to wake it up
Don't it feel so good girl?
Don't stop get it get it, 'bout to jump all the way up in it
Love the way you drop low and bend it
Girl you're killing me, wait a minute
Love the way you that shake it up
Too natural to make it up
Won't be long 'fore we wake it up, that's right
I know you ain't used to havin' real niggas like me around
I'm here to change your whole life girl, so you don't deal with clowns
And treat you like a superstar that you are
Cause I'm a superstar too and I know
Exactly what I must do to make you
Feel! I'm about to wake it up
Feel! See I'm about to wake it up
Feel! I'm about to wake it up
Don't it feel so good girl?
Feel! I'm about to wake it up
Feel! See I'm about to wake it up
Feel! I'm about to wake it up
Don't it feel so good girl? That's right
