Chorus:
I would swallow my pride
I would choke on the rhines
But the lack thereof would leave me empty inside
I would swallow my doubt turn it inside out find nothing but faith in nothing
Want to put my tender heart in a blender
Watch it spin around to a beautiful oblivion
Rendezvous then I'm through with you
I burn burn like a wicker cabinet chalk white and oh so frail
I see our time had gotten stale
The tick tock of the clock is painful
All sane and logical
I want to tear it off the wall
I hear words and clips and phrases
I think sick like ginger ale
My stomach turns and I exhale
Chorus
So Cal is where my mind states but it's not my state of mind
I'm not as ugly sad as you
Or am I origami
Folded up and just pretend demented as the motives in your head
Chorus
I alone am the one you don't know you need take heed feed your ego
Make me blind when your eyes close sink when you get close tie me to the bedpost
I alone am the one you don't know you need you don't know you need me. Make me
blind when your eyes close, time me to the bed post
Chorus
