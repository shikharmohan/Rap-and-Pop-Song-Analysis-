The American Dream
Hey yo nephew, why don't ya come up off them keys?
Sing a lil' somethin' for the ladies
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Let 'em know how we feelin' right now
Every time I come around, shawty love me down
Run up on me like click clack, my gun out like take that
She make you do what I do when we doin' what we doin' in back of the 'Lac
I'm like come up off of that
And every night her body gets jacked
That gangsta, gang-gangsta
That gangsta, gang-gangsta
Gangsta, gang-gangsta
That gangsta love
Yeah, she love it the way I put it on her
Blowin' trees, summer breeze, sippin' Corona
Lost Dogg, I give it to her right and she like it
She on the hip like a sidekick, izzy
One of the coolest of fool on the flow
I whispered in her ear, come here you ready to go?
I rolled up a winna and put it up in the air
Got that lil' dress on, you comin' up outta there, yeah
She like that, you like that?
You say you bite, well, I bite back
And I'm all go, we can do it 'til tomorrow
I beat it up like Harpo
Snoopy, I go hard, baby, yes
Kissin' on yo' chest then I'm diggin' out your stress
I won't stop 'til yo' finished
You never felt love 'til a gangsta get up in it, Dream
Every time I come around, shawty love me down
Run up on me like click clack, my gun out like take that
She make you do what I do when we doin' what we doin' in back of the 'Lac
I'm like come up off of that
And every night her body gets jacked
That gangsta, gang-gangsta
That gangsta, gang-gangsta
Gangsta, gang-gangsta
That gangsta love
She always call in the middle of the night
'Cause I'm a dog, I'ma give her what she like
She say my name loud, I say her name low
That's what I aim fo', that's how the game go
Baby like the way I wake her up
'Cause I'm a gangsta, I grab her by the butt
Pull her to my side, I'm in deep
Woke that ass up just to put her to sleep
Everyday is the same thang, I creep in
It's like true blood, I sink my teeth in
I gotta have it, the LB raised me
We was taught to dig 'em down crazy
Lights out, I'm so lit
Mama's so gone, daddy won't quit
I won't stop 'til you're finished
You never felt love 'til a gangsta get up in it, Dream
Every time I come around, shawty love me down
Run up on me like click clack, my gun out like take that
She make you do what I do when we doin' what we doin' in back of the 'Lac
I'm like come up off of that
And every night her body gets jacked
That gangsta, gang-gangsta
That gangsta, gang-gangsta
Gangsta, gang-gangsta
That gangsta love
It's the life that you chose
The loop, the coop, the rows
Anything goes
It's so good got her wigglin' her toes
The boss, The-Dream
The floss, the cream
The trips overseas
All these things really don't mean a thing
When I'm tearin' that ass up, workin' you like a shift
I give it to you like a gift
You hear what that boy say? You wouldn't jack, give it up fast
Then I hit it from the back
Snoopy you're so good, she screamin' and I like that girl
She off in another world
I won't stop 'til you're finished
She love this gangsta especially when I'm in it, Dream
Every time I come around, shawty love me down
Run up on me like click clack, my gun out like take that
She make you do what I do when we doin' what we doin' in back of the 'Lac
I'm like come up off of that
And every night her body gets jacked
That gangsta, gang-gangsta
That gangsta, gang-gangsta
Gangsta, gang-gangsta
That gangsta love
Gangsta, gang, gangsta
That gangsta, gang, gangsta
Gangsta, gang, gangsta
That gangsta love
