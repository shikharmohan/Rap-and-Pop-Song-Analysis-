Hey, the price of fame cost too much
Like these niggas talk too much
I'm ready for whatever, somebody better tell 'em
Said, I'm ready for whatever, hey, hey, hey
Even though my head in the clouds I'm planted on the pavement
How I walk around people starin' in amazement
I play a lotta game, a well being I ain't playin' with it
They so judgmental man, but they don't understand
If ya life was in jeopardy erryday is you tellin' me
You wouldn't need weaponry just because of ya felony's
Consider this at least I got errybody sweatin' me
Homies streets is people who won't rest unless I rest in peace
Killed my folk a year ago still in my sleep they threatin' me
Paranoid, ya stressin' me ain't nobody protectin' me
I'm dealing with the pressure from my partner dying next to me
Niggas know I was arrested, they coming for me eventually
This was all the things that I was goin' through mentally
This could be the reason I ignore the penitentiary
Not mentionin' New Orlean niggas comin' in the city
Killin' all summer long ain't nobody pay attention
Now is it that hard to understand if you listen
Either die or go to jail that's a hell of decision
But I'm wrong and I know it my excuses unimportant
I'm just tryna let you know that I ain't think I had a choice
I had straps in my ride gotta go to prison
You waitin' on me to die you gon' be waitin' for a minute
Boy, I'm ready for whateva, somebody betta tell 'em
I'll be here when the smoke clear and errythin' settle
Can't afford the price of fame 'cause it cost too much
Man these sucka niggas lame and they talk too much
That why I'm ready for whateva, somebody betta tell 'em
I'll be here when the smoke clear and errythin' settle
Foreal, foreal, ey foreal, I said when errythin' settle
Foreal, ey foreal, ey foreal, ey foreal
I said when errythin' settle foreal
I'mma man, I ain't perfect, I admit it I'm guilty
But understand feel me, I was ridin' filthy
'Cause niggas out there plottin' to rob me and kill me
500,000 erry year spent on security
My future was bright but now it's gettin' blury
'Cause niggas in a hurry to find me and bury me
But surely God'll deliver me up out it
I'mma fighter till the heart, I'll foreva be about it
I'mma father to my sons, asset to my community
Look all that I done my good out weigh the negativity
Ey, mentally I was focused on not lettin' history repeat itself
That's why heat was kept in the vicinity
Yes, officially I broke the law but not maliciously
Through all the publicity was anyone considerin'
My position and the logic hidden my decision
But they caught me wit 'em now I'm off to prison, period
But is it that hard to understand if you listen?
Either die or go to jail that's a hell of decision
But I'm wrong and I know it my excuses unimportant
I'm just tryna let you know that I ain't think I had a choice
I had straps in my ride gotta go to prison
You waitin' on me to die you gone be waitin' for a minute
Boy, I'm ready for whateva, somebody betta tell 'em
I'll be here when the smoke clear and errythin' settle
Can't afford the price of fame 'cause it cost too much
Man these sucka niggas lame and they talk too much
That why I'm ready for whateva, somebody betta tell 'em
I'll be here when the smoke clear and errythin' settle
Foreal, foreal, ey foreal, I said when errythin' settle
Foreal, ey foreal, ey foreal, I said when errythin' settle foreal
Foreal, foreal, ey foreal, I said when errythin' settle
  (Ey I said listen homeboy)
  (You can talk all you want mayne you know what I'm sayin')
Foreal, ey foreal, ey foreal, I said when errythin' settle foreal
  (Errybody talking to the king you know what I'm sayin')
  (They like Escalades errybody got one)
But the fact of the matter remain
If ya ain't walk a mile in my shoes and ya ain't live a day in my life
Ya ain't survive the shit I done survived
Ya ain't had to deal with the shit I had to deal with homeboy
You can't mutherfuckin' judge me partner
I mean look at folk like Sean Taylor
You know what they said they said had he had a strap
He woulda lived today, you know what I'm sayin'
Now true enough I did wrong I broke the law
I deserve to be punished I understand that aight cool
But listen, man, I gotta house full of kids
A mama and an old lady who life in my
Responsibility, you dig that?
Now for all of y'all who think I was just ridin'
Around on some dumb shit
You know I'm smarter than you man
You know I'm smarter than you dawg
Ey if you think I was just being stupid
Shorty, I got some mutherfuckin' ocean front property
In Idaho for sale, homie
If you believe that I gotta bridge in Brooklyn I wanna sell you partnah
Ey man real talk in order to understand my train of thoughts
You'll have to put yo self in my position
You can't expect me to think like you
'Cause my life ain't like yours you know what I'm sayin?
If you don't understand that you don't  understand English, I'm done talkin'
