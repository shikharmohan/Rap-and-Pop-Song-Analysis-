Said I remember! Oh, when we used to sit (Where at?) - Wyclef
In a government yard, in Trenchtown {Town!} - Marley Sisters
(And what did you used to see son?)

Good friends we have, and oh well!

And little Georgie, would make the fire light! (I tell ya!)
As...Stolen cars passed through the night {Night!} [Newark, New Jersey, AH-Ha!]
And then we'd hit, the corner store! 
For Roots, paper, and brew, wooh! {Brew! Whoo!}
My drinks, my only remedy! I tell ya! (Sold out! Sold out!)
For pain of losing, family...
But while I'm gone, sure thing...
