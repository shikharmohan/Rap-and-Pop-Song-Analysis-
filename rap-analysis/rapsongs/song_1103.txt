It's just a fly love song, what
Mmm
It's just a fly love song, what
Are we living in a dream world? Are your eyes still green girl?
I know your sick and tired of arguin' but you can't keep it bottled in
Jealousy, we got to swallow it your heart and mind baby follow it
Smile, happiness you could model it and when you feel opposite
I just want you to know your whole being is beautiful
I'm going to do the best I can do 'cause I'm the best when I'm with you
Come close to me baby
Let your love hold you
I know this world is crazy
What's it without you
Put down your bags love I know in the past love
Has been sort of hard in you but I see the God in you
I just want to nurture it though this love may hurt a bit
We dealin' wit this water love you even give my daughter love
I want to build a tribe wit you protect and provide for you
Truth is I can't hide from you the pimp in me may have to die with you
Come close to me baby
Let your love hold you
I know this world is crazy
What's it without you
I know what you're thinkin', you're on my mind
You're right, you're right, you're right
You're runnin' so fast you just might take flight
Hope your not tired, tonight, tonight
You help me to discovery me I just want you to put trust in me
I kind of laugh when you cuss at me the aftermath is you touchin' me
It's destiny to we connected girl you and I we can affect the world
I'm tired of the fast lane I want you to have my last name
Come close to me baby
Let your love hold you
I know this world is crazy
What's it without you
I know what you're thinkin', you're on my mind
And you're right, you're right, you're right
You're runnin' so fast you just might take flight
Hope your not tired, tonight, tonight
I know what you're thinkin', you're on my mind
And you're right
You're runnin' so fast you just might take flight
I know what you're thinkin', you're on my mind
And you're right, you're right, you're right
You're runnin' so fast you just might take flight
Hope your not tired
