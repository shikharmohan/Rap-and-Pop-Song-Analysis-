(Chorus -- Mos Def)
Don't look down
Seen impossible view
Fly like an eagle
Whatever you do
Don't look down
Seen impossible view
Spread you wings
Ariel...
(Verse 1 -- Lupe Fiasco)
Head to the sky
Wings raised and...
She's about to fly
And take her place in
I'm for in the stars
When she leaves the ground
She'll see a broken heart
If she turns around
But ain't no going back, this is how it must be
He told her she'll be burned alive, she just told him trust me
If funerals are beautiful, this ugly 
Knowing this he told her you would leave me if you love me
And he knows that, because he knows her
Hard to hide his feelings, as it engulfs her
Now she's a bright blaze light rays
I shoot and out our Phoenix on fire, burning up the night scape 
So let's hear it for our heroin
The plod is spirituals, flies to the never end
One closed chapter it, opens up another part
So this is more like, thee end, question mark (?)
(Chorus -- Mos Def)
Don't look down
Seen impossible view
Fly like an eagle
Whatever you do
Don't look down
Seen impossible view
Spread you wings
Ariel...
(Verse 2 -- Kanye West)
Don't let me hold you back
I only hold you back
We on in Venice street, this block has got a col-de-sac
So fly baby, my baby, is so hot
Sometimes your so hard to say 'bye'
We made it from the alley, straight up to the ballet
We pulled up at the valet 
We'll teach our daughter ballet
We'll raise us a Beyonc
