Ayyo, my murderous rap verbal attack is actual fact
Tactical tracks match perfectly with graphical stats
Half a you lack the magical dap of tragical rap
That tackles you back and shackles and laughs at you
That's the mathematical madness I'm on
The savage, the strong, the marriage, a bond of havoc and song
This massacre's on as if Picasso laced you
There's lot's a hateful skeletons locked
In the closet of my castle of Grayskull
I'm possum at grade school
That's why I have to debate you
My raps are like Capel, slashin' your face, you
That's how a master degrades you
I'm battlin' Jesus if he passes through my label
I'm snatchin' his halo
God, I pray that you send my father back as an angel
Language is fatal and it's hypnotizin'
I'm only emphasizin'
I'm still all about business and enterprisin'
I'm super lyrical, a brain boosts the chemicals
That's used contenicals inside of my mental project able
Lyrically I'm supposed to represent
Niggaz'll tell you that I'm nice with the blah, blah, blah
Lyrically I'm, I'm supposed to represent
Black Thought, the super lyricist, your arch-nemesis
Still with the Punisher, that's my accomplice
Stressin' to emcees how they don't really want this
Electrifying shit his excellency thought spit
These cats they sentimental such with a gentle touch
Dancin' double dutch and all sayin' nothin' much
My sound wave liftin' your chin up like uppercuts
New found ways of rippin' shit up, I de-ve-lop
Your squad chest swell up, still you're miniature to me
Naturally I bring the extremity
Musically intense with the globe in suspense
Contemplatin' where the world traveler been since
The Roots bless you with a strong record, long like a epic
Immerse you in some ol' next shit, ill poetic
Thought from Illadelph somethin' like nothin' else
My talk stomp like elephants upon every elf, 'cause what?
Lyrically I'm supposed to represent
Niggaz'll tell you that I'm nice with the blah, blah, blah
Lyrically I'm supposed to represent
You will lose I must break you
Lyrically I'm supposed to represent
Niggaz'll tell you that I'm nice with the blah, blah, blah
Lyrically I'm, I'm supposed to represent
Ayyo, peace Roots east coast niggaz reppin' the streets
Most with heat, toast and keep close, more Phillies than Pete Rose
These dos, niggaz that'll lift ya mentals
Lyrics'll twist your temples into pretzels like the Triumph instrumental
My instrumental's the renaissance, no resemblance
To nothin' you come across, lyrical holocaust
The crowd pleaser emcees freeze then catch seizure
They praise the Lord of rap thesis, true believers
Just call me Baby Jesus 'cuz lately niggaz be praisin' me
Just for the way I blaze the beat crazily, tape to CD lasery
It pays to be amazingly flavory
Gaze in to my rhymes that basically hypnotize you occasionally
Occasionally as I focus on my next opus
The way it's all fucked up and emcees is hopeless
I leave your head wrecked as I erect sculptures
My thought's just a fortress, approach this ferocious up-closeness
Lyrically I'm supposed to represent
Niggaz'll tell you that I'm nice with the blah, blah, blah
Lyrically I'm, I'm supposed to represent
Lyrically it's suicide
Lyrically, you've seen him
You know how strong he is
Lyrically you can't win
Lyrically it's suicide
Lyrically, you've seen him
You know how strong he is
Lyrically, you can't win
Lyrically, you can't win
Lyrically, you will lose
Lyrically, I must break you
Lyrically, lyrically
