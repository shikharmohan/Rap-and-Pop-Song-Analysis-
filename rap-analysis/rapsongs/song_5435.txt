There will be no more room for y'all with no originality
Woo
You're the reason I don't trust no one
And I don't love no one
From the places I've come
Sad songs I've sung
All the times I've been stung
For you bring the worst out of me
And I can't down these tears I've cried
The heaviness inside
Left me so petrified
Tried to keep love alive
But I became too tired
'Cuz you bring the worst out of me
Eh, eh, eh, hey
I wish I could change the way things have gone
And start life anew and now maybe once again
I don't know anywhere but somethin' must've went wrong
And all I have to say
Is when I sing this song
I get so teary eyed
'Cuz you get under my skin
Can't let you suck me dry
I was gonna marry you, have kids for you
Stay true to you, live life with you
But look what you've done to me
I compromised all my time
And rearranged my life
To make sure you was fine
'Cuz our love was on the line
And I became so unkind
'Cuz you brought the worst out of me
This is how the story goes
For all those one's who know
When it's out of control
You work and you work
And someone gets hurt
And I guess that be me
When I sing this song
I get so teary eyed
'Cuz you get under my skin
Can't let you suck me dry
I was supposed to marry you, kids for you
Stay true to you, live life with you
But look what you've done to me
Eh, eh, eh, hey
I wish I could change the way things have gone
And start life anew and now maybe once again
I don't know anywhere but somethin' must've went wrong
And all I can say
Is when I sing this song
I get so teary eyed
'Cuz you get under my skin
Can't let you suck me dry
I was suppose to marry you, have kids for you
Stay true to you, live life with you
But look what you've done to me
