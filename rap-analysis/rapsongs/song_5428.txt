Yeah, yeah
I love you more then my mouth can say
I'll take a flight to any state, anyplace
Just to be in your face
Come on
From New York City to Japan
I'll be there baby
Just call my phone and I'll come flying
On the next plane to you
Never worry 'cause I'm your woman
And I promise baby
I promise you will be my man
'Cause baby it's real, so real
Can't you tell by the look in my face? Yeah
Oh baby, it's real, so real
I hope you're feeling the same
'Cause baby it's real
I'll follow you right to the moon
If I had to, yeah
Just so we could be close as cousins
Pour my heart out to you
I love you more then words can offer
Pay attention baby
I hope this never ends, my lover
'Cause baby it's real, so real
Can't you tell by the look in my face? Yeah
Oh baby, it's real, so real
I hope you're feeling the same
'Cause baby it's real, yeah
I don't wanna spend a day without you
I don't get tired of being by you
I don't care 'bout the things about you
Boy it's real
So real, so real
Can't you tell by the look in my face? Yeah
Oh baby it's real, so real
I hope your feeling the same
'Cause baby it's real
