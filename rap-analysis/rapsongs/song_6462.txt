[Intro: Scarface talking]
oooohh, yo Vice drop this heat dog, ugh
hit the bass line, yo Vice what you're doin' man
straight up, ugh
[Verse 1: Scarface]
I'm too deep to quit, and too strick to fold
and you need to split nigga G into code
come on, these years to teach, homey speak to know it
bodybag what we're talkin' about, you weak, you row
the game is overcrowded so we fight for space
neighbourhood show the hustle, still we grind to win
tryin' to find a way, to come up on 2 pounds of yay
and double up it, ain't never happened touch it
a lot of niggaz focued on they candy paints
and that was in the grills, steering wheels and grand
but I ain't trippin' out here, flippin' I just need to thank
money miny, yo all the mission tryin' to steal me bank
ride and homicides we get it, fuck it, peepin' in horn
killin' all these pussy niggaz think they keepin' in God
Pistol cocked on the block and all they fearin' is death
then again nigga, roaddog you feelin' me yet
so if I die, I'm tryin' to get it mamma, barely deed
and pray to God that he kept this spot hell me
sad as fuck, what the nigga stuck down the raw
bust friends, back in the prison, foundin' rock to the troup
here I smoke and tryin' to hide it but was played by the rule
and if live like the gold fiend then you'd do what they do
I'm on my own limits sold buck words
all alone in the ghetto, deep in weed, sweat in Jelly Nose
worrey eyes, you either do it or you die
crimin' in flood, ridin' your blood, cause this is your life...
[Chorus: Johnny P]
our golden law, now foes or friends
I'm on my own, no hoes, no ends
I been smillin' but I can't innovate
I feel that hurt but I can't explain it
I have been around with a player or two
and still ??Hurricane can be, ??
?? loose when you pumped the face
real nigga blues and it hold your aims
you're bold or fold no in betweens
console your seems don't blow your creams
also don't you loose your dreams
this is my life, this is my life
[Verse 2: Willie D]
I just got word: my uncle done died
but ain't no tears on my face cause I done already cried
I been here before, dead to me is not new
my heart safe it, mamma don't, cops too
I got my best to get my purpose to the Lord
but sometimes this shit be fuckin' with me hard
and I'm heartless, I'm a kid again
lookin' out my window watchin' niggaz get murdered
in college worked the parties, step with??, drink ??
just to get through the night
go to school only the anchor stomach givin' you fight
cause sure there were fights and I was bustin' like a the sun bitch
the smartest nigga on the block live in ??kick
the convicts with worry ?? hard to ?? to the tails
searchin' for heaven and livin' in hell
they say I'm wrong for teaches this on
fuck what you believe, can't heal by myself
that's the way I'm livin', this is my life
[Chorus: Johnny P]
our golden law, now foes or friends
I'm on my own, no hoes, no ends
I been smillin' but I can't innovate
I feel that hurt but I can't explain it
I have been around with a player or two
and still ??Hurricane can be, ??
?? loose when you pumped the face
real nigga blues and it hold your aims
you're bold or fold no in betweens
console your seems don't blow your creams
also don't you loose your dreams
this is my life, this is my life
[Verse 3: Bushwick Bill]
I only got one eye but I see things ever so clear
been acquainted with death but I never know fear
I still roll to spots, cats scared to go there
if it's a heaven for a G, if not, prepare to go there
I live for today and not promise tommorrow
smoke weed and set lead and try to dry my sorrows
in this game of life ain't no rules to follow
and if I come to lie for them it's a hard heal to swallow
I'm still the smallest cat with the biggest rep in H-Town
stress in my life is gettin' hard to take down
havin' visions of cats rollin' in my weight now
it feels like I'm about to have a nervous break down
it takes a big man to share this pride
tryin' to get my soul right and put the brain inside
y'all niggaz are so scared to ride
they got it from Still I alive to Why I Feel So bad inside
this is my life....
[Chorus: Johnny P]
our golden law, now foes or friends
I'm on my own, no hoes, no ends
I been smillin' but I can't innovate
I feel that hurt but I can't explain it
I have been around with a player or two
and still ??Hurricane can be, ??
?? loose when you pumped the face
real nigga blues and it hold your aims
you're bold or fold no in betweens
console your seems don't blow your creams
also don't you loose your dreams
this is my life, this is my life
