Hey, I gotta start it, MC's be carted, off ya soft
Dinosaur Jr. will flood that's gotta warn ya
What in blazes, hey this, is phat weigh this
I'll portray this photographs, so the last laugh is mine
You're behind, for the mind, and for the soul
That's how I roll now I hold the mic
With my life depended on it, I'm doin' ya bond it
My non gets warts it and I'm apart from wackness
I'm separated did you like how I spiked the ball
Despite ya all you could come bite a small portion
There's more in the vault halt, have a malt
I alta your brain patterns yet it's my fault
I sustain phatter blends of words heard, stampede
Damn he the speech with two teach?
Just me, no simile, never flow simply 'cause it was meant to be
The truth, the truth, and nothing but the truth, I tell it to the youth
Propelling with the proof, in the puddin', wouldn't you like to know?
Oh, no you didn't, my flows never quittin', and that's the truth
The motherfuckin' truth, my man
I'm on the scrimmage waitin' for you fucking imitations
And I'm not discriminating myself when I'm making my wealth
Pure facts, it's hard for me to endure wack MC's
I lay my tracks with ease
I'm tellin' you that Del is truth appelin' through your arteries
You scar your knees bowing, praising, now when I phase in
Like Kitty Pride, City Wide
Confer to kick the rumor him admit he lies
The truth will set you free when I upset MC's
Execute MC's I do my best to mute MC's
All it takes is intelligence, I'm great with embellishments
They need a savior so Del is sent
Yeah, the truth, the truth, the nothing but the truth
I tell it to the youth, propelling with the proof
In the puudin', wouldn't you like to know?
Oh, no you didn't, my flow is never quittin'
And that's the truth, the motherfuckin' truth, my man
The truth, the motherfuckin' truth
I'll punch you in your tooth, ass drop the roof, bitch
You know my attributes so don't act cute
It's moot a closed casket, the most massive
Fluff, just me no simile
Never flow simply 'cause it was meant to be
Never concluded sever your crew with microlazer surgery
I get Adam split up like atoms like the Molecule Man
Now all of you stand like a congregation
On the basement titric
Hip-hop not carin', sharin'
Tearin' Jones here in clones wearin' bones
Skeletons, your plasma is like gelatin
And tell a friend who's developin' 'cause Del's intelligent
Yeah, my lyrical technique will make ya body freak
My lyrical technique will make ya body tweak
My lyrical technique will make ya body seek
The beaning, double-teaming, on your motherfuckin' brain
Yeah, see that hoe, too, yeah, bitch, fuck it, slammin'
