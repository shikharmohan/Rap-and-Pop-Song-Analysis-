I got more class than most of 'em, ran wit the best of 'em
Forgave the less of 'em, and blazed at the rest of 'em
What can I say? Cal-i-for-ni-A
Where niggaz die everyday over some shit they say
Disconnected from the streets forever
As long as I got a beretta, nigga, I'm down for whatever
I roll wit my shit off safety, for niggaz that been hatin' me lately
And the bitches that wanna break me
If Cali blew up, I'd be in the Aftermath
Bumpin' gangsta rap shit, down to blast for cash
'Cause from Eazy-E, to D.O.C, to D.P.G
Started from that S.O.B, D R E
Like dub-c I'm rich rollin', pistol holdin'
Pockets swoll nigga, that's how I'm rollin'
Put the flame to the killer nigga
Worldwide homicide mob figure and a builder, for real
I'm hittin' switches, makin' bitches eat bitches
See me grab my dick every time I pose for pictures
I own acres, floor seats watchin' the Lakers
I'm cool with eses who got AK's in cases
Dedicated to all of those with big ego's
Never fakin', we get the dough and live legal
Haters hate this, we sip the mo' and yank the heezos
Niggaz play this in they Rovers, Jeeps and Regals
Dedicated to all of those with big ego's
Never fakin', we get the dough and live legal
Haters hate this, we sip the mo' and yank the heezos
Bitches play this in they Benzes, Jeeps and Geos
I bust a Mr. Toughy, slash a smoothy doobie
Crash and flex on Tuesday's, harassin' hoes at movies
Passin' by with Uzis, and who you aimin' at?
That Shady bitch and that bitch nigga that was claimin' that
I don't sympathize for wack hoes and wimpy guys
You got to recognize hitman is a enterprise
Cali pride, born to ride and south centralized
The Henny got me energized, smoke the guys
Tryin' to focus on mines, poke they eyes out
I'm L.A.'s loc'est, hope they don't have to find out the hard way
Like snitch niggaz in the pen that get
Hit when the guards look the other way
We hittin' hard, hitman and Dre
You playin' games, I suggest you know the rules
We puttin' guns to fools, make you run your jewels
Take yo' honey and cruise to the snootiest snooze, Cabos
Pop coochie 'til the nut oozes, you shouldn't fuck wit crews
That's sick, Aftermath cause we rule shit
I'm big hit, don't confuse me wit no other by the flow motherfucker
Dedicated to all of those with big ego's
Never fakin', we get the dough and live legal
Haters hate this, we sip the mo' and yank the heezos
Niggaz play this in they Rovers, Jeeps and regals
Dedicated to all of those with big ego's
Never fakin', we get the dough and live legal
Haters hate this, we sip the mo' and yank the heezos
Bitches play this in they Benzes, Jeeps and Geos
