Of the world
Spun by evil men with lies
Only programmed to agree
With what we see before our eyes
Running after status quo
On a television show
Just a picture perfect life
It's the only life we know
And this uncomfortable reality
Got me chasing, chasing fallacy
And the pace the pace is killing me
But I so willingly practiced it
Just like it's my friend
When the whole world is a hustle
Exactly where did we arrive
In this manufactured life
to Sell my soul just to survive (yes)
In the game of numbers
I must thank the Gods of Industry
oh for the opportunity
or I display such loyalty
oh for the way that they exploit me (yes)
Oh to consider life outside of this
Just like a splinter in
My mind persists
But the ministry of fear exists
Only to keep me from knowing the truth
Stealing my youth (oooh)
When the whole world is a hustle
Escape familiarity
Means that I must face the fear in me
And do something with this greed in me
In order to address this need in me
Oh but I must confess
The pride I keep
Protecting as if it's my friend
Oh, when will it end?
When the whole world is a hustle
To consider life
Outside of this
Just like a splinter in
My mind persists.
But the ministry of fear exists
Only to keep me from knowing the truth.
And it's my excuse
When the whole world is a hustle
When it is, when it is.
(Instrumental)
Oh to escape this mere analogy
Means I must face the fear in me
And do something with this greed in me
In order to address this need in me
Oh but I must confess
The pride I keep
Protecting as if it's my friend
Until the bitter end
When the whole of the world is a hustle
Everybodys got it going on (yeah right, yeah right)
Everybodys so damn strong (yeah right, yeah right)
When the whole of the world is a hustle
A hustle (x5)
I must exercise my faith
When the whole world is a hustle
