Aye c'mon
But they don't hear me no
Uh, but they don't hear me no
Uh, but they don't, they don't
They don't, they don't
I got blood on my hands and there's no remorse
And got blood on my dick 'cause I fucked a corpse
I'm a nasty nigga when you pass me nigga look me in my eyes
Tell me to my fuckin' face that you ready to die
You be a dead motherfucker, red motherfucker
Don't be stupid, you heard what I said motherfucker
Who shot you? Aw nigga, like you don't know
Stickin' you for yo' dough while I'm fuckin' yo' broke ho
Yo! don't you get the picture? Niggaz can't touch me
'Cause I don't give a fuck G, I'll get you touched B
I got choice, to rip my slug or take apart a door
And enough crazy niggaz behind me to start a war
So what you want nigga? help, 'cause you se about to rest
When I'm fed, Red Cross couldn't clean up the mess
And a vest will do nuthin' but make you look a little thicker
'Cause in the dark you ain't nuthin' but a lil' nigga
And if you'd been thinkin' about that shit you did
You wouldn'ta brought the joint, with you kid
Now I'ma have to get you kid, and split your wig, with the machete
I bring beef to niggaz, and string 'em out, like spaghetti
You ain't ready nor can you stand how I'm bringin' it
I'm givin' it is how I'm livin' it so I'm swingin' it
Red dot on your head, 'cause youse in mid range
Red dot on your chest, opens up your rib cage
I just love when a nigga bring his whole crew
It's just a bigger piece of cake for me to chew a hole through
I just love when a nigga bring his whole crew
It's just a bigger piece of cake for me to chew a hole through
I just love when a nigga bring his whole crew
It's just a bigger piece of cake for me to chew a hole through
I just love when a nigga bring his whole crew
It's just a bigger piece of cake for me to chew a hole through
Now if your heart was as big as your mouth, you'd be real
But it's not so I know if you get knocked, you'll squeal
Like a bitch, 'cause you is a bitch and always been a bitch
And you know how niggaz do a bitch we run up in a bitch
Put something in a bitch
Nigga, do you know me? Nigga do you owe me?
Figured you could blow me?
Well I'm a let this trigger fill you homey
Y'all niggaz gots to be smokin' somethin'
Thinkin' you chokin' somethin'
Fuckin' around with me, you'll be a broken somethin'
I'm out for 'blood' with the 'crips' at war
How much shit could you talk with your lips on the floor?
Pussy niggaz make me itch, so I scratch, you is a bitch
So I snatch up your face, fake ass pencil I scratch you
Yeah there was a time
When I woulda jumped up and choked this nigga
But now I'm on some shit like, yo smoke this nigga
I'm 'bout to find out how much guts you got before I spill 'em
Somebody come and get this motherfucker before I kill him
Fresh out the asylum, I'm whylin'
Y'all niggaz know the phone numbers for help you best to dial 'em
911, emergency, the urgency
Will have witnesses seein' what the surgeon see
How far you gon' get, with your dome split fool
I catch your man slippin', 'cause he think his shit cool
But it ain't, so I paint the walls with his blood
Another dick in the mud, nigga what
