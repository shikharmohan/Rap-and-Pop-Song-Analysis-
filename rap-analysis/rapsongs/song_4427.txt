Welcome to the carter little shop of horror
Bloody like a period after D-R
Doctor IÃÂ¢€m a dog, IÃÂ¢€m a dog, IÃÂ¢€m a dog ya
Not Georgetown but IÃÂ¢€m a uptown whore ya
Brothers like Warner someone shouldÃÂ¢€ve warned ya

Or get cornered, then get tortured, then get slaughtered
In that order

Eat you alive, alive

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Massacre music lose it, looses, loosen a noose round my neck IÃÂ¢€m turning blue bitch
bout to go stupid that Holly grove zoo shit
Keep a set of grip plies for ear pair loose slips
I done said I was too sick, I said IÃÂ¢€m too, too sick
Four sick, Five sick, Six sense Dead people
Just put ahead people Instant, Instinct
I donÃÂ¢€t care what color you is I burn your turn your skin pink
And if you canÃÂ¢€t stand me then knock me down
But I donÃÂ¢€t wanna hear that shit like shit Foxy Brown
Its Weezy F. People
And I donÃÂ¢€t talk shit like deaf people
New Orleans refugee like Wyclef people
My street eagle
And nigga watch your ego
Cause if you think you too fly then I shoot down that eagle
And then the monster see you
And the monster need food
And that monsters me too
So the monster eat you 
[Chorus: Juliana]
I done warned you boy of the monster boy
HeÃÂ¢€s a monster
Feed him rappers or feed him beats
And now heÃÂ¢€s gonna eat
And now heÃÂ¢€s gonna eat
Yeah 
[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Tired of playing with yÃÂ¢€all boys
Wayne you ready?
Luda, yeah
ThatÃÂ¢€s right IÃÂ¢€ll eat you alive Ludacris IÃÂ¢€ll eat you, eat you
till there ainÃÂ¢€t nothing left,
til the cops canÃÂ¢€t identify none of your facial features
letting out my rage unleash the beast
unlock your guest of honor
let me out the cage IÃÂ¢€ll eat these beats
IÃÂ¢€m hip hops Jeffrey Dammar
Have yet to be defeated my spot is still reserved
till you sell diamond nigga (what) donÃÂ¢€t say a fucking word
my flows are animalistic just say IÃÂ¢€m a seasoned Vet
I received my masters in rapping you just a teacherÃÂ¢€s pet
and IÃÂ¢€m this seasons threat
yeah IÃÂ¢€m fucking mother nature
flow so hard if you get up on the track IÃÂ¢€ll make your own mother hate you
act like she donÃÂ¢€t even know you, act like she donÃÂ¢€t even care
Ludacris turns rappers to ashes
roll ÃÂ¢€Ãem up and put ÃÂ¢€Ãem in the air
itÃÂ¢€s rap orientation and yes IÃÂ¢€m glad to meet cha
IÃÂ¢€ll bring the pain aye Lil Wayne go get the anesthesia
for these non-contenders for these rhyme offenders
their time is not on my agenda bitch nigga
[Chorus - Ludacris]
cause I done warned you boys IÃÂ¢€m a monster boy

feed me rappers or feed me beats (feed me beats)
IÃÂ¢€m a gonna eat, Ludacris IÃÂ¢€m gonna eat (say what)
IÃÂ¢€m gonna eat you alive (hey)
(eat you alive) Eat you alive
IÃÂ¢€m ÃÂ¢€Ãbout to eat you alive
Ludacris IÃÂ¢€ll eat you alive (I eat ÃÂ¢€Ãem alive)
