Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hip hop nation, this is Spiz-ike Lee
Been sleepin' for too long, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
I see the sunshine gazin' through the window pane, yeah
Blazin' like indo flame, it's to wake up, come to yo' senses, manye
Snow is all around you, but you don't play in the winter games
Cartridges surround you, but you ain't playin' Nintendo games
Load 'em up and fill 'em up, to the top before you cock and aim
Tryna get from the bottom to the top, like the stock exchange
Shower shit and shave and hit the corner for a block exchange
Amazin' what my people'll do for some pocket change
But maybe this ain't the life that you chose
This is the life where you stay strapped
And pack a knife or end up with a blooded nose
Street survivor or survivor of the streets
And only the strong survive, there's no survival for the weak
Catch a sneak peak of death if you ain't on ya Ps and Qs
They carry banana clips and niggaz'll peel you for ya shoes
It's the blues, but not on hill street
You could call it, kill or be killed street
Lost a pint of blood, let it spill street
Stop and wake up, wake up
They say my folks'll do whatever for the fortune and the fame
And it'll take a fortune to get rid of all the pain, but I'm sayin'
Use your brain homie, do the right thang, lemme talk to 'em
Use your brain homie, do the right thang
You say the only family that you got is in a gang
And the only way to make it is by sellin' cocaine, but I'm sayin'
Use your brain homie, do the right thang, lemme talk to 'em
Use your brain homie, do the right thang
I've been in this 'ere since we were drinkin' beers
Years we've spent together, used to break up, get together
Split a fight every night, gettin' cheddar, movin' white
Our thang, so we had to do it right like Spike
Holdin' forties, gettin' green on acres, these broads were our mules
That's when we used to serve in front of Commonwealth School
Fuel for cars and jewels, chains and tools
It was organized crime but we remained confused
Mom in the pews singin', Lord, protect 'em
You might not agree with our views, but you had to respect 'em
Diamonds in the rough, but were we reflectin'
A system that's abrupt, the streets [Incomprehensible]
One mornin' in the mirror, I seen my reflection
A young man with good spirits, but needed direction
I guess my man's death was my resurrection
'Cause now I hear him sayin' from heaven, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
They say my folks'll do whatever for the fortune and the fame
And it'll take a fortune to get rid of all the pain, but I'm sayin'
Use your brain homie, do the right thang, lemme talk to 'em
Use your brain homie, do the right thang
You say the only family that you got is in a gang
And the only way to make it is by sellin' cocaine, but I'm sayin'
Use your brain homie, do the right thang, lemme talk to 'em
Use your brain homie, do the right thang
I woke up this mornin' and got a call
My pot'nah said he had news about a girl named Baby Doll
She got fo' baby daddies, fo' kids by fo' different men
And she just found out she's pregnant, I said, no, not again
Man, when she gonna learn she don't wanna spend her life in court?
Lookin' for back payments and fightin' for that child supports
Chasin' checks, chasin' her ounce of respect, chasin' paper
Chasin' entertainers or rappers and ballplayers
Not carin' about a condom, I say, help her Lord, please
'Fore she stuck wit mo' babies or ends up fightin' some disease
You know that you a momma and mommas, we can't lose ya, no
Treat yourself better, you carry seeds to the future
And the future looks dim if we don't get ourselves together
We gotta sacrifice, some do whatever for the cheddar
So make the right decisions 'til you ready to give birth
And know that you the most precious gift we have on this earth
Babies, stop and wake up, wake up
They say my folks'll do whatever for the fortune and the fame
And it'll take a fortune to get rid of all the pain, but I'm sayin'
Use your brain baby, do the right thang, lemme talk to 'em
Use your brain baby, do the right thang
You say you want a family but it's hard without a mayne
And the only way to make it is to get him fo' his change, but I'm sayin'
Use your brain baby, do the right thang, lemme talk to 'em
Use your brain baby, do the right thang, lemme talk to 'em
Wake up, wake up
It's a new day
C'mon brothers, wake up
C'mon sisters, wake up
ATL, wake up, wake up, baby
Chi-Town, wake up, wake up, wake up
Brooklyn's in the house
Wake up, Brooklyn
Ludacris, Common Sense and me, Spike Lee
Always do the right thing
I got it, I'm gone
