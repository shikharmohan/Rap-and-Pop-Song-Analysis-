[Intro]
The fuck son..
I'm tellin' you man..
You gotta watch these niggaz man..
[Chorus]
I'm paranoid, bitch I can't sleep
Niggaz tryna get me, man gimme my heat
Put one under my pillow, one under my seat
Niggaz lookin' at me like I'm somethin' to eat
[Verse]
We thought the coke and the dope'll help us escape poverty
When that didn't work we resorted to armed robbery
Yeah I done it but I ain't the one they say did it
Before my first verse my Benz had been kitted
I'm so hood, that's what the bitches like about me
She bob and weave she up and down she suck the life up out me
I tell you about my regimen I'm blowin' stacks stuntin'
The coldest shit I'm on it kid I blow a nigga frontin'
I'm dirty yeah I do that dirt I'm down to put that work in
I kick that door to get them bricks that eagle get to chirpin'
See the beam and your hit, nigga leakin' yeah screamin' and shit
Man shut the fuck up..
[Chorus]
I'm paranoid, bitch I can't sleep
Niggaz tryna get me, man gimme my heat
Put one under my pillow, one under my seat
Niggaz lookin' at me like I'm somethin' to eat
I'm paranoid, bitch I can't sleep
Niggaz tryna get me, man gimme my heat
Put one under my pillow, one under my seat
Niggaz lookin' at me like I'm somethin' to eat
[Verse]
I had a dream niggaz got me
Woke up and niggaz shot me, I ain' slept in three days
My eyes red, somethin' wrong with my head
The mack stashed right under the pillow on my bed
It's not hot, why the fuck am I sweatin'
My heart beatin', I'm buggin', I reckon
Bitch don't move, it's dark, I might panic
Jus' sit still, I mean it, god damnit
My back against the wall, fuck the world I kill 'um all
Ain't a nigga too big or too small
Chop 'um down watch 'um fall, watch 'um bleed watch 'um crawl
Watch 'um bleed till they gone..
[Chorus]
I'm paranoid, bitch I can't sleep
Niggaz tryna get me, man gimme my heat
Put one under my pillow, one under my seat
Niggaz lookin' at me like I'm somethin' to eat
I'm paranoid, bitch I can't sleep
Niggaz tryna get me, man gimme my heat
Put one under my pillow, one under my seat
Niggaz lookin' at me like I'm somethin' to eat
I'm paranoid..
[Outro]
I can't even fuckin' sleep, I'm paranoid
Bitch quit playin hand me my heat, I'm paranoid
I can't even rest my head, I'm paranoid
I'm finna leave me a nigga dead, I'm paranoid
What..
Niggaz ain't fuckin' with me..
I wish a nigga would..
I been takin' it easy on these niggaz mayne..
I been easy on 'um mayne..
I'ma turn it up now..
Yeah..
