Moma Mia, niggas wanna G her, Snoop Dogg
Bitches wanna be her, motherfuckers can't see her
Give it up for Moma Mia
What you want to do nigga, is fine with me
Name your game, scandalous sprees or robberies
Movin' keys for your needs, from state to state
I seen my braw take down your boy from around tha way
If you fake I'm gunna let you know from the top
And leave that dick in your mouth and put them infrared dots
On your whole crew, nigga betta ask fo show
Gunna let that ass know what's goin' down like Waco
This is business and who the fuck you think is runnin' this?
Mama and who's the first to shoot that gun in this
Mama, drama, layin' no limit
And when it's intended my hands all up in it
Now, we can do this like intelligent folk
But fuck around, I be that second ward ignorant hoe
Hard headed, with the soft behind, niggas real hittin' it
So Snoop Dogg for the keepin' it real with a strength
Now picture, Bonnie and Clyde, we side as we slide
Side by side to keep this pimpin' alive
Do a lick for me, set a trick for me, get us some chips
It's all about you and me Mia, fuck that bitch
You a fall girl, go get it all girl
You in my world, I'm gunna make sure you ball girl
Do it for me, do it for you, now it's our world
Our world, it's our world, now go on and get it
Now everyone in my click know I don't love no hoes
I don't quit bitch rush a boy to get a new set of them momos
'Cus I attack 'em, crack 'em and smack 'em
All on the same note, until that bitch is broke
Charge it to the game, man it's a cold game
But somebody gotta do it, that's real for she's a
It ain't easy, pimpin' to me is four girls on your team
Down to scheme, aim to beam, for that cream
Cross country track, Greyhound bus ride
Down to get your muthafuckin' fetti on, you hear me though
There ain't no limit to what she does
On the really, on to Philly, lemme get a ride on 'cus
Ghetto love and every thug need a little
All I want is the money, motherfuck the middle
No backbone is back on to get yah
Unless you got a down ass sister to twist her, can't twist yah
Bonnie and Clyde, we side as we slide
Side by side to keep this pimpin' alive
Do a lick for me, set a trick for me, get us some chips
It's all about you and me Mia, fuck that bitch
