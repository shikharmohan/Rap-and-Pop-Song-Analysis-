Give me all you got, girl, give me, give me
Give me all you got, girl, give me, give me
Give me all you got, girl, give me, give me
Give me all you got, girl, give me, give me
If I'm hot for you and you hot for me
What you got for me is no shock to me
Still can't believe you're my property
The sound of you ploppin' on top of me
The feeling of hitting the lottery
Or passin go-twice in Monopoly
Doesn't, dare to compare to what you got for me
The taste of the puddin' is so chocolaty
Hope to seein' it, so, I'm seein' it
Still got my sneakers and my chain on, lean in it
Moonlight, hit it right it start gleamin'
Mean faces, for what was the meanin'?
Pop it a little bit, drop it a little bit
It's hard to read you, I feel like I'm illiterate
But I'm ready for the graduation
Yeah, right there, repeat that rotation
Give me all you got baby, tonight
Now's the perfect time, come, blow my mind
It's cold out here, please, let me come inside
Ooh, so warm at night, you blow my mind, hey, yeah
Yeah, baby, go ahead and talk greasy
Tell me, how you never had it this deeply
I'ma whisper slick, you respond sweetly
Extra freaky, I trick and you treat me
I'll give, you take, but don't hesitate
When you feel it girl, throw it right back
Just let me hold ya by your shoulders
Damn, you can take it like that?
I knew, you was a champ girl
You got your leg on the dresser kickin' the lamp girl
Run the shower, let's head in the bathroom girl
'Cause the temperature's hotter than high noon girl
I crack that do', let the steam blow
Ain't nobody here but me and you, let it go
You never had it this good, you already know
Give me all you got, tonight, really though
Give me all you got baby, tonight
Now's the perfect time, come, blow my mind
It's cold out here, please, let me come inside
Uh, so warm at night, you blow my mind, hey, yeah
You're the sexiest woman I've ever known
Baby, my mind is blown
It's simply beautiful
How you do it to me
You're showin' me things, I never knew
A whole 'nother side of you
Just keep doin' what you do
It feels like, ooh wee
You can go and have the wild climax
Ain't no way, I'm 'bout to let you relax
Let me see, if you can hold me on your back
Let me see you wind your body to the track
Pop it a little bit and, drop it a little bit
It's hard to read you I feel like I'm illiterate
But I'm ready for the graduation
Yeah, right there, repeat that rotation
Give me all you got baby, tonight
Now's the perfect time, come, blow my mind
It's cold out here, please, let me come inside
Uh, so warm at night, you blow my mind, hey, yeah
Gimme all you got, girl, gimme, gimme
Gimme all you got, girl, gimme, gimme
Gimme all you got, girl, gimme, gimme
Gimme all you got, girl, gimme, gimme
I like that baby, yeah
Ah-ha, yeah
Oh, well, yeah
