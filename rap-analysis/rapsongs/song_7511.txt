Never Again
[hebrew man praying]
[Intro:]
Feel this
To all those races, colors, and creeds, every man bleeds
for the countless victims and all their families 
of the murdered, tortured and slaved, raped, 
robbed and persecuted - Never Again! 
To the men, women, and children
Who died and struggled to live, never to be forgotten
[hebrew man praying]
[Verse 1:]
Yo my own blood 
Dragged through the mud
Perished in my heart still cherished and loved
Stripped of our pride, everything we lived for
Families cried
There's no where to run to, no where to hide
Tossed to the side
Access denied
6 million died for what?
Yo a man shot dead in his back
Helpless women and children on the constant attack 
For no reason
Till the next season 
And we still bleeding
Yo it's freezing 
And men burn in hell, some for squeezing 
No hope for a remedy, nothing to believe
Moving targets who walk with the star in their sleeve
Forever marked wit a number, tattooed to your body
Late night, eyes closed, clutched to my shotty
Having visions, flashes of death camps and prisons no provisions
Deceived by the devils decisions
Forced into a slave
Death before dishonor for those men who were brave 
Shot and sent to their grave
Can't awaken, it's too late
Everything's been taken
I'm shaken, family, history, the making 
[Chorus:]
Never again shall we march like sheep to the slaughter
Never again shall we sit and take orders
Stripped of our culture
Robbed of our name (never again)
Raped of our freedom and thrown into the flames (never again)
Forced from our families, taken from our homes
Moved from our God then burned of our bones
Never again, never again
Shall we march like sheep to the slaughter (never again)
Leave our sons and daughters
Stripped of our culture
Robbed of our name (never again)
Raped of our freedom and thrown into the flames (never again)
Forced from our families, taken from our homes
Moved from our God and everything we own
(never again)
[Verse 2:]
Some fled through the rumors of wars
But most left were dead, few escaped to the shores
With just 1 loaf of bread
Banished, hold in for questioning
And vanished
Never to be seen again
I can't express the pain
That was felt on the train
To Auscwitz, tears poured down like rain
Naked face to face 
With the master race
Hatred blood of David
My heart belongs to God and stay sacred
Rabbi's and priests
Disabled individuals 
The poor, the scholars all labeled common criminals
Mass extermination 
Total annihilation
Shipped into the ghetto and prepared for liquidation
Tortured and starved
Innocent experiments
Stripped down and carved up or gassed to death
The last hour, I smelled the flowers
Flashbacks of family then sent to the showers
Powerless undressed
Women with babies clumped tight to their chest 
Crying
Who would've guessed dying
Another life lost
Count the cost
Another body gas burned and tossed in the holocaust (never again)
[Chorus:]
Never again shall we march like sheep to the slaughter
Never again leave our sons and daughter
Stripped of our culture
Robbed of our name (never again)
Raped of our freedom and thrown into the flames (never again)
Forced from our families, taken from our homes(never again)
Moved from own God and everything we owned
Never again, never again
Shall we march like sheep to the slaughter (never again)
Shall we sit and take orders
Stripped of our culture
Robbed of our name (never again)
Raped of our freedom and thrown into the flames (never again)
Forced from our families, taken from our homes (never again)
Moved from our God and burned of our bones
(never again) (never again)
NEVER AGAIN 
NEVER AGAIN
The final solution
Is now retribition
Remedy, Wu-Tang
