Since I'm so fucking bad
Give me mine
Get yours, oh
I woke up this morning, rocked up
Humping on the mattress hard like I was fuckin'
I realized I was dreaming then I got up
I hit the Vick's inhaler 'cuz my nose was stuffed up
From the bed to the floor, to the bathroom to the sink
From the mirror to the toilet, took a piss then shook the shank
Oops, don't look know, I think I sprinkled when I tinkled
So, I dip in the sides there be a sweeter by the seater
Cocoa powder, bubble bath, and rubbing alcohol
For 5 fuckin' cent you could buy them all
I'm a long distance super-power, pussy-magnet
I was born in the ghetto, made by the ghetto
Ghetto fabulous
Living like this, I'm so happy, yeah
'Cuz I'm ghetto fabulous
Living like this, I'm so happy
'Cuz I'm ghetto fabulous, living like this
It's like a big rush with no time, niggas be like 'What?'
Kids be like, 'Let me get your autograph', bitches be like 'Ah!'
Ever since I said, "Here I go" braids or not y'all
They know me everywhere I go
I'm real private windows tinted, doors locked
The damn crowd you make a scene,"Ain't you Mystikal?"
"No, I'm not!" Lie to a die hard fan with a straight face
And let the hour long picture signing session take place
Sign, hey, baby, how you doing? What's your name?
Stay real, stay sweet, stay sexy, stay the same
And never forget I'm never going to change
I'm loving what I'm doing and you can put that on your game
I got my piece of pie and my piece of mind
Fool, I'm a piece of coal, don't call me, people, let me shine
I know you see me on TV
With Snoop, Fiend, Mia, C, Silkk, Serv, and Petey
Nigga we frontin' these streeties
But livin' like this ain't easy, it's fabulous, I'm so fucking bad
Ghetto fabulous
Living like this, I'm so happy, yeah
'Cuz I'm ghetto fabulous
Living like this, I'm so happy
'Cuz I'm ghetto fabulous, living like this
See, that's a cutie with her big booty and her big body
Her and her big fine potnahs
Take their [Incomprehensible] and take their vitamins
Be ordering drinks all down at the bar we don't got to buy
Just work that halter top and twork them tight bell bottoms
Oh, you acting funny and trying to holler
She project Tyra Banks the neighborhood supermodel
She shaped like a coke bottle
Hair whipping smelling good finger nails and her toes polished
She did it how she lived 'cuz she got to have it
First got them fucking kids by the baby's daddy
Her ass ain't never what she should have been
Go ahead on and act bad, I'll see you when I get a hit
Ghetto fabulous
  (See, she was so fucking bad)
Living like this, I'm so happy, yeah
'Cuz I'm ghetto fabulous
Living like this, I'm so happy
'Cuz I'm ghetto fabulous, living
Ghetto fabulous
Living like this, I'm so happy, yeah
'Cuz I'm ghetto fabulous
