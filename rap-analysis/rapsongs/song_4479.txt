The hottest, hottest under the sun
Ain't nobody fuckin' with me, man
You already know that, pimpin', yeah
Cash Money Records, where dreams come true
Fuck up my dreams, somebody goin' die tonight
You already know that, pimpin'
Hey, it's Cash Money Records man, a lawless game
Unfuckin' believable, little Wayne's the president
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em even if they celibate
I know the game is crazy
It's more crazy than it's ever been
I'm married to that crazy bitch, call me Kevin Federline
It's obvious that he'll be Cash Money 'til the death of him
The ground shall break when they bury him, bury him
I know one day they gotta bury him
But I lock my casket tight baby, so I don't let the devil in
People, it's just me and my guitar, yeah, bitch I'm heavy metaling
You can get to fuckin' Led Zeppelin
Niggas is bitches, bitches, I think they full of estrogen
And we hold court, take your life for the settlement
Yes, I'm the best, and no I ain't positive, I'm definite
I know the game like I'm reffing it
This is Tha Carter, Tha Carter 3, the new testament
And I'm the God, and this is what I bless them with
Bitch, I'm me, I'm me, I'm me, I'm me
Baby, I'm me, so who you? You're not me, you're not me
And I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm a mothafuckin' Cash Money millionaire
I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm a mothafuckin' Cash Money millionaire, yeah
Junior, it's Cash Money over everything
It's in my blood I feel it running in every vein
I'm from the mud, I am a missile like the scud
What's really good, I'm about to ruckus like fud
And I stay on my flow and Cash Money like a rug
Tied to the fuckin' Birdman like a log
And dear Mr. Ronald Williams
To you I shall forever give thanks like a pilgrim
Cash Money million, heir to the throne
Going at their heads like hair in a comb
Sittin' by the window, I just stare at the stone
Knowin' I might get through it like hair in a comb
Know money over bitches, my niggas trust my sisters
And I will take or trash it with the Lord as my witness
And you all have witnessed, but I am not finished
So keep your mouth closed and let your eyes listen
That I'm me, I'm me, I'm me
Baby, I'm me, so who you? You're not me, you're not me
And I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm a mothafuckin' Cash Money millionaire
I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm still a mothafuckin' Cash Money millionaire, bitch
Last year they had the Grammys and left me in Miami
Sleeping on a nigga like I'm rapping in my jammies
I'm rapping when you sleep, I was rapping when you were in jammies
Mel Gibson flew Lethal Weapon, book 'em Danny
I'm a monster I tell you, monster Wayne
I have just swallowed the key to the house of pain
Now I'm stuck here to deal with the house's pain
Fuck with me, I will peel like the house's paint
Let's go, niggas don't see me 'cause I'm better than both
The only time I will depend is when I'm seventy years old
That's when I can't hold my shit within so I shit on myself
'Cause I'm so sick and tired of shitting on everybody else
I'm tryna tell you like I'm saying something
I'm from the dirty like the bottom of my pants cuff
And there ain't nothin' gonna stop me
So just envy it, hey, I'll accept a friendly quit
Ha, yeah
I'm me, I'm me, bitch, I'm me
Baby, I'm me, so who you? Fuck you, you're not me
And I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm a mothafuckin' Cash Money millionaire
I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I am a mothafuckin' Cash Money millionaire, bitch
The hottest, hottest under the sun
Ain't nobody fuckin' with me, man
You already know that, pimpin'
Cash Money Records, where dreams come true
Somebody goin' die tonight
You already know that, pimpin'
Hey, it's Cash Money Records man, a lawless game
