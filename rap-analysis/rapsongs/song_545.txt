[Intro - Krayzie]
YÃÂ¢€all know who it is: BONE THUGS-N-HARMONY, HARMONY, HARMONY
[Chorus - Krayzie & Flesh]
They know IÃÂ¢€m crazy by the flow
N-gga never lazy ÃÂ¢€bout my dough, dough, dough
IÃÂ¢€m in the flesh but IÃÂ¢€m quest for moÃÂ¢€
Bizzy, Wish, & baby just pay me the money IÃÂ¢€m owed, owed, owed
Ooooh yeah
Back is that mighty reala
Ooooh yeah
DoinÃÂ¢€ it the way they never
Ooooh yeah, Ooooh, oooh yeah, ah yeah
[Verse 1 - Layzie Bone]
See, all I know was get out and get it
I stay on the grind all night ÃÂ¢€til my feet go numb
BlowinÃÂ¢€ moÃÂ¢€ weed than Cheech & Chong
LivinÃÂ¢€ by the motto: To each his own
Got speed, its on
Flesh freed, he home
Then weÃÂ¢€d go wrong, it wasnÃÂ¢€t in the plan
Designed by the Man upstairs
This testimony and we say, ÃÂ¢€ÃWe can, we can!ÃÂ¢€
We can do it
Gotta put ya mind to it
Put ya feet in the dirt
Just push right through it
When shit get rough
You gotta stick to it
Play that Bone Thug music
ItÃÂ¢€s that feel-good music
Chill or act a fool with it
Real thug niggas with real-life drama is just like watchinÃÂ¢€ a movie
Soundtrack of my life
Right how they bounce back more than twice
Alright, I admit we done did some crazy shit
But I stop, repent
Kept God in my sights
Recognize it was a fight
Either youÃÂ¢€re wrong or youÃÂ¢€re right
Let the song be the light
Eternally them Bone Thug soldiers
IÃÂ¢€m Mighty Mo-ThugginÃÂ¢€ foÃÂ¢€ life!
[Chorus - Krayzie & Flesh]
[Verse 2 - Flesh-N-Bone]
Ooooh, yeah
They back, finna hit yÃÂ¢€all with that mighty real good, ooooh
No doubt about it
You bound to feel it good
We still hood, even though we came up
Changed the whole game up
No matter how much they angry steady saying we ainÃÂ¢€t the same.
Pointing the blame at us
The only thing is Imma go get it even if I gotta split your wig
They canÃÂ¢€t get enough of my style cause I got the job well done winning it (winninÃÂ¢€ it)
Big upÃÂ¢€s to all of my hustlers
While the globe spinninÃÂ¢€, it ainÃÂ¢€t time to sleep
Break me off a piece of that paradise pie
ÃÂ¢€ÃTil the day I die, Imma represent my peeps
Hit up food from all of this
Somebody sneak they piece
NothinÃÂ¢€ but heat for the streets
Now turn up that Bone beat (beat)
They tried to hold me, but couldnÃÂ¢€t keep me down cause Flesh got a whole world of my trues to be found
[Chorus - Krayzie & Flesh]
[Verse 3 - Bizzy Bone]
You owe me money, man
If not I gotta get my respect
ItÃÂ¢€s too many years of grindinÃÂ¢€
Baby mama want my royalty checks
It ainÃÂ¢€t about Twista
But nobody flippinÃÂ¢€ their tongue like Ripsta
No nigga done caused my earthquake like march
Remember that way little Capo got hurt when
My niggas is hurtinÃÂ¢€ daily
Good thing Wally see me and Krayzie
They would have just left them hailin
And there were shots in the melee
It was never to protect myself
little Layzie got em baby!
And I pop, popped everyone else
Tanks swell over the double
Me problems tends again and never left
When I see the face of Zee
Bothers me, backÃÂ¢€n yo step!
You never could feel my wepts (remember that)
Would never have got dissed with Bone
Off to another dimension
You owe me, but IÃÂ¢€m on my own
Now come on!
[Chorus - Krayzie & Flesh]
[Verse 4 - Krayzie Bone]
YEAH!
Still chasinÃÂ¢€ that paper, dawg
And I wonÃÂ¢€t slow down ÃÂ¢€til I done made it all
They better give me whatÃÂ¢€s mine
Imma get it then go grind
Get up in it one moÃÂ¢€ time (time)
Better ask about my rep
Better check yourself, self, self
They mustÃÂ¢€ve thought I was somebody else, body else
Yeah, everybody better (?) little bit of Bone Thugs
Bet theyÃÂ¢€ll never own us
We originated that there, shoÃÂ¢€ nuff
Better run and go get they flow heard
Came from Cleveland, Ohio
The realest that I know
TheyÃÂ¢€ll never sound nothinÃÂ¢€ like Bone, clones!
Them faders, the greatest, and even the haters is singinÃÂ¢€
Yeah we make ÃÂ¢€Ãem zone
We make ÃÂ¢€Ãem sing, sing!
No matter what they say
Everybody, all know Bone changed the game, game, game
We made them sing like me
Against the grain, grain, grain
If they donÃÂ¢€t wanna respect me and where I come from
I tell ÃÂ¢€Ãem they can run on up, come on over and get ÃÂ¢€Ãchu some, get ÃÂ¢€Ãchu some, some
[Chorus - Krayzie & Flesh]
