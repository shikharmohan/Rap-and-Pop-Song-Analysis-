(Oh my God)
Uhh
(He's back)
Success
(He's back)
They love success
(Where you been?)
Right here baby
Look in the mirror while I tell you a tale
About a mogul named Uncle L
Sit on eight figures, man with a vision, move with precision
  (He excels, they all fail)
Undisputed, the game got so polluted
That he turned his radio off
He needed a beat so he could  jingle  them bells again
Watchin' the plasma TV in the loft
  (With somethin' soft)
With a leapord print outfit on
'Cause he known to flood any mic he spit on
He's a
  (Uhh uhh, phenomenon)
Ice glistenin', listenin' to break of dawn
He went from Hollis to Hollywood in fact
Owned the Dow Jones and stacked the NASDAQ
Conference call with his broker, "What's the yield on that?"
"Exotic Motorcars", we want a deal on that
Mirror mirror
  (You go baby)
Speak to me
  (You flow baby)
What's this image that I see before me
  (You know baby)
It's a winner
  (You go baby)
Please believe it
  (You go baby)
I can see it so I can achieve it
  (You flow baby, you go baby)
Around the way girls be
  (Doin' it well)
They love the way that man look on the
  (Double XL)
On the Money magazine covers
When he stop at the light, it's like his Benz hovers
Smoke blowin' from the chrome exhaust, of his Boxer Porsche
  (Look at him, lickin' his lips when his joint pull off)
Ever since boomin'  system, damn she missed him
She, couldn't resist him, dreamt she kissed him
In a, warm jacuzzi full of milky cereal, she said
  (I need love from the grand imperial)
I been his biggest fan since five years old
And now I'm 22, I love money
  (Ooh)
Backseat of the jeep, you need that
  (Who do you love?)
Baby repeat that
  (Who do you love?)
You need to keep back
Milk and pink cookies he known to eat that
Mirror mirror
  (You go baby)
Speak to me
  (You flow baby)
What's this image that I see before me
  (You know baby)
It's a winner
  (You go baby)
Please believe it
  (You go baby)
I can see it so I can achieve it
  (You flow baby, you go baby)
Tryin' to get as much money as possible
No negative consequences
Knahm sayin' baby?
I'm goin' long, feel me
Hey lover, I'm loungin'
Goin' back to Cali, cop a crib on the mountain
Strobe lights jumpin' off, birdies is bouncin'
  (Four)
To the 3 2 1 he stopped countin'
Eliminated competition quickly
Phantom of the Opera on the low where your clique be
He feel his flow deep down in your artery
Peep her man's checkbook that's where his heart'll be
  (Uh)
6 minutes of pleasure  for Jack the ripper
Young players fall quicker from chicks and hard liquor
But uhh, he's bad, he got the power of God
In the Four Seasons, laughin' at the L'urmitage
He been there, mini-bars, R and B stars
Young groupies in the lobby on the search for
  (Bobby)
Young tycoon in the Steve Wynn suite
Readin' e-mails with ten on repeat, I seen it
Mirror mirror
  (You go baby)
Speak to me
  (You flow baby)
What's this image that I see before me
  (You know baby)
It's a winner

Please believe it

I can see it so I can achieve it
  (You flow baby, you go baby)
Yeah, 10, faith, power of God
Yeah, c'mon, work it with me baby
Work with me ma, uhh, it's been too long, 10
