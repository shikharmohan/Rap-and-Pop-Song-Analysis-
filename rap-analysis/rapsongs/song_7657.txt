Class in session when I talk then listen, ya
But you know how it go real n***** pay attention
Ain't talkin' money we speakin' a different language
The hatin' *** gonna be the translators
They move to slow when I think to quick
That's why I Flash like Gordon
I'm light years ahead of you ***
That's why I forgot more than you learned
It's my spot, now you better wait your turn
And that yayo, s*** that's irrelevant
You can't hide the fact that I'm intelligent
Street smart with the little book sets
A young *** with a lot of common sense
They say I'm shallow but I think so deep, how deep
Deep as the abyss so when you get a minute
Take a look at my wrists wassup
Hypnotized, you are hypnotized
Hypnotized, you are hypnotized
Hypnotized, you are hypnotized
Hypnotized, you are hypnotized
Now I command you *** to get money, hey
Now I command you *** to get money, hey
Now I command you *** to get money, hey
Now I command you *** to get money, hey
Rock ice yeah, *** live life
Can't explain the feeling when I'm ridin' in the Chevy
I'm on top of the world just gives me the chills
Yet I'm big on wheels
A thousand there with the dreams in mills
Then grands at the mall just for thrills
*** I get it right back *** that's for real
It's all in the game free throws and fouls
Half a mill in the basement ***damn I'm flavored
I want it all no matter the cost
*** the consequences ain't nothin' to a boss
Made a lot out of a little something out of nothing
I'm so proud of me put the streets
On top where their supposed to be
The sky is the limit that's what Jesus said
And the limit is the sky, let's slice that pie
Hypnotized, you are hypnotized
Hypnotized, you are hypnotized
Hypnotized, you are hypnotized
Hypnotized, you are hypnotized
Now I command you *** to get money, hey
Now I command you *** to get money, hey
Now I command you *** to get money, hey
Now I command you *** to get money, hey
Hypnotized, you are hypnotized
Hypnotized, you are hypnotized
Hypnotized, you are hypnotized
Hypnotized, you are hypnotized
Now I command you *** to get money, hey
Now I command you *** to get money, hey
Now I command you *** to get money, hey
Now I command you *** to get money, hey
