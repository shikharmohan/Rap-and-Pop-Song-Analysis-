The coolest niggah... what? [X16] 
Lord please have sympathy, and forgive my cool, young history, as 
The coolest niggah... what? [X4] 
[Verse 1]
I love the Lord, 
But sometimes it's like that I love me more 
I love the peace 
And I love the war 
I love the seas 
and I love the shore 
No love for no beach 
baby, that's law 
But she doesn't see, therefore I spoil 
I trip, I fall 
run up and raw. 
I love her, with all my heart 
Every vein, every vessel, 
every bullet lodged 
With every flower that I ever took apart 
She said - that she would give me greatness, 
status, placement above the others 
My face would grace covers 
of the magazines of the hustlers 
Paper, the likes of which that I had never seen 
Her eyes glow green with the logo of our dreams 
The purpose of our scene, 
The obscene obsession for the bling 
She would be my queen, 
I could be her king 
Together, she would make me cool 
and we would both rule, forever, 
And I would never feel pain 
and never be without pleasure, ever, again 
And if the rain stops, 
And everything's dry 
she would cry 
Just so I can drink the tears from her eyes 
She'll teach me how to fly 
Even cushion my fall 
If my engines ever stall 
and I plummet from the sky 
But she will keep me high 
And if I ever die 
She would comission my image on her bosom 
To him 
Or maybe she'd retire as well 
A match made in Heaven set the fires in Hell 
and I'll be... 
The coolest niggah... what? [X8] 
Lord please have sympathy, 
And forgive my cool, young history as 
The coolest niggah... what? [X4] 
[Verse 2]
And so began our reign 
The Trinity, her and I came 
No weather man could ever stand 
What her and I can 
Hella hard 
Umbrella, whatever, 
put plywood on propeller panes, 
And pray to God that the flood subside 
'cause you gonna need a sub till he does reply 
And not one of Jared's 
You think it's all arid 
and everything's irie 
Another supply 
That means another July 
Inside my endless summer 
That was just the eye of the Unger 
Felix, 'cause he is the cleanest amongst the 
Younger, outstanding achieving up-and-comers 
The ones that had deadbeat daddies 
and well to do mommas 
But not well enough to keep 'em from us 
The ones that were fightin' in class 
Who might not pass 
Rap record pressure to laugh 
and a life not fast 
"Can you feel it?"[echo] 
That's what I got asked 
"Do I love her?"[echo] 
I said I don't know 
Streets got my heart, Game got my soul 
One time's my sunshine will never hurt your soul 
Quote 
To a crying, dishonored baby momma 
Who's the momma to a daughter 
That I had fathered from afar 
My new lady gave me a Mercedes 
and a necklace with a solid gold key 
Like the starter of a car 
The opener of a door or two pounds of raw 
You gave me a baby, but what about lately? 
then ha-ha-ha-ha-ha'd 
Right up in her face, G 
There's more fish in the sea, 
I'm on my mission to be, be 
The Coolest niggah... what? [X8] 
Lord please have sympathy, 
and forgive my cool, young history 
The Coolest... what? [X4] 
[Verse 3]
Come. These are the tales of The Cool. 
Guaranteed to go and make you fail from your school 
And seek unholy grails like a fool 
and hang with the players of the pool 
Fast talkin' on the hustle 
No Heaven up above you 
No Hell underneath ye 
and nowhere will recieve thee 
So. 
Shed no tear 
when we're not here 
and keep your faith, 
as we chase 
The Cool [echoes]
