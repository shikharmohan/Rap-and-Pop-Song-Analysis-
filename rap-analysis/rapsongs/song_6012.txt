Uh huh, well the name is latifah, you hear me coming through
The spreaker. hit it mark, 45 king
I am a bill, yes I'm only a bill when
It's time to ill I get ill and time to chill
I chill, my homeboy said this was the d.a.i.s.y. age
I take it as meaning you have to get crazy paid
You hope I'm from your borough, because I'm thorough
You want me to be down with you, to be seen walking around with you
Go to the store and buy a brew and rock a rhyme or two
So you can bite it, you taste it, you like it
You think I'm sleeping on you? please, don't even try it
The name is latifah, the scene, it is mine
The 45 king keeps the beat and the time while i
Rock to the rhythm and keep it blowing out
So don't try to turn me inside out
Latifah is the name you love
Flying through rhymes like a dove
Slapping suckers with a glove
Challenge me and you will burn
Yes in the fire you will burn
It's so so simply done
When I find that I have to run
Lyrics to music by the king of swing, the 45 king
The words we bring I write, and sing
Cause I am latifah, the queen of course
Don't try to get yours off, because the cause is lost
Mark conducts the beat, I watch it hit them
Won't you chill? I don't need another victim
To add to the list of aggrivation
Subtracting suckers like a math computation
We are not teaching pupils and subjects with no scruples
This is a king and queen creation
So hello hello hello and how ya doing? 
Forget the smalltalk now, it's time for me to ruin
Those who don't believe in what I'm saying
When I put up the wall of words ain't no way into my queendom
Controlled by me, the heir to the throne is the ruler lord ramsey
The ruler lord, to him there is no equal
He grabs it and starts bombing people
Don't listen to me to figure me out
Because you can't turn my mind inside out
Latifah is the name you love
Flying through rhymes like a dove
Slapping suckers with a glove
Challenge me and you will burn
Yes in the fire you will burn
Rhyming's not a question of one superiority
But rather how you delegate the use of your authority
I know who you are, and I know who you are to me
But I came here just to party
If it's a show you want, the show it live
And if it's trouble you seek, I have arrived
When mark requests my approval, I nod
And after each and every single rhyme I thank god
Altough a taste of my body would soothe you
I give you just my voice and watch the rhythm move you
The method of my lyrics makes the funky people feel it
And lord have mercy on those that try to steal it
Latifah is a name meaning "delicate and sensitive"
But I have no problem formulating sentences
To break you down to the ground
I won't use violence, the color of this is brown
And I am down, but never ever down and out
So don't try to turn me inside out
Latifah is the name you love
Flying through rhymes like a dove
Slapping suckers with a glove
Challenge me and you will burn
Yes in the fire you will burn
Jah know? cause ah...
Music, 45 king, music latifah the queen
Music, domination to bring the world
Irie, say in the fire you will burn (repeats to fade)
