I know it's strange
But my brain's gone really insane
And I'm off the chain
Sippin' on a fifth of the Golden Grain
I feel like slappin' a nigga today
Slappin' a nigga today
I feel like slappin' a nigga today
Slappin' a nigga today
I know it's strange
But my brain's gone really insane
And I'm off the chain
Sippin' on a fifth of the Golden Grain
I feel like slappin' a nigga today
Slappin' a nigga today
I feel like slappin' a nigga today
Slappin' a nigga today
This mornin', I woke up on the wrong side of the bed
I'm sick of people puttin' lies in my head
I don't really wanna work, I'm tired
I hate my 9 to 5
And I'm thinkin' 'bout killin' my boss today
Killin' my boss today
I'm thinkin' 'bout killin' my boss today
Killin' my boss today
Yesterday my best friend died
Somebody came and took his life
Now I'm looking up at the sky
Have you ever seen a grown man cry?
And I'm askin' why did You take him away
Why did You take him away?
I'm askin' why did You take him away
Why did You take him away?
I need some money please
I can barely make it on these streets
'Cause I got a couple mouths to feed
My baby's in dire need
So I'm thinkin' 'bout robbin' a bank today
Robbin' a bank today
I'm thinkin' 'bout robbin' a bank today
Robbin' a bank today
Baby mama's at home and fussin'
Callin' up my mobile cussin'
Always yappin' about this and that
But she really don't be talkin' 'bout nothin'
Somebody take my pain away
Take my pain away
Somebody take my pain away
Take my pain away
I know it's strange
But my brain's gone really insane
And I'm off the chain
Sippin' on a fifth of the Golden Grain
I feel like slappin' a nigga today
Slappin' a nigga today
I feel like slappin' a nigga today
Slappin' a nigga today
I know it's strange
But my brain's gone really insane
And I'm off the chain
Sippin' on a fifth of the Golden Grain
I feel like slappin' a nigga today
Slappin' a nigga today
I feel like slappin' a nigga today
Slappin' a nigga today
Somebody just broke in my ride
Snatched up everything inside
Even got my 45
How am I supposed to survive?
When I know that my stereo's taken away
Stereo's taken away
When I know that my stereo's taken away
Stereo's taken away
Gas prices are way too high
Rich people are way too fly
Am not where I wanna be in my life
But why am I so behind?
Is it 'cause I'm wastin' my time away?
Wastin' my time away
Is it 'cause I'm wastin' my time away?
Wastin' my time away
My grandmama's nerves are bad
And everybody in the hood is mad
'Cause President Bush could give a damn
About our ass
So I don't wanna hear shit that he has to say
Shit that he has to say
I don't wanna hear shit that he has to say
Shit that he has to say
Troops gone and we still at war
Nobody even really knows what for
Even more I'm scared to find
What the world really has in store
'Cause you know that tomorrow's not promised today
Tomorrow's not promised today
'Cause you know that tomorrow's not promised today
Tomorrow's not promised today
I know it's strange
But my brain's gone really insane
And I'm off the chain
Sippin' on a fifth of the Golden Grain
I feel like slappin' a nigga today
Slappin' a nigga today
I feel like slappin' a nigga today
Slappin' a nigga today
I know it's strange
But my brain's gone really insane
And I'm off the chain
Sippin' on a fifth of the Golden Grain
I feel like slappin' a nigga today
Slappin' a nigga today
I feel like slappin' a nigga today
Slappin' a nigga today
I know it's strange
But my brain's gone really insane
And I'm off the chain
Sippin' on a fifth of the Golden Grain
I feel like slappin' a nigga today
Slappin' a nigga today
I feel like slappin' a nigga today
Slappin' a nigga today
I know it's strange
But my brain's gone really insane
And I'm off the chain
Sippin' on a fifth of the Golden Grain
I feel like slappin' a nigga today
Slappin' a nigga today
I feel like slappin' a nigga today
Slappin' a nigga today
