(scarface whispering):
I don't really remember feeling like this
Got this love formin' in my lifefrom this dame
And indeed took the form of lifeit's a shame
How a man can fall in love with dreams--not afraid
Not afraid to let you up and leave
Do your thang maryjane mess with all my folksgot 'em high
For the days that they were lost and brokeshit got 'em by
Only right was stopping it from props
Plus she from the block of only finer crops
Do your thang maryjane
Chorus:
Mary, mary, mary, mary, mary
Mary, mary, mary, mary, mary
Happy just to hear your name
Do your than maryjane
Mary, mary, mary, mary, mary
Mary, mary, mary, mary, mary
When the world starts to stress you outwhat you do? 
Put a cancer stick up in your mouthor grab a brew
Sold in stores but the fact remains isthey the blame
And the government's been taxin' that (  )-- gettin' paid
If it's taxable it's cool to smoke--kill or not
And the alcohol is killin' folks? true or not
Other people try to make you bad--but I know you not
When my situation's lookin' sad I know I got
A true friend in my time of needall I need
Your natural you come from seedsi decree
Makes me happy when I'm feelin' pain
Once again makes me happy just to hear your name
Do your thang maryjane
Chorus:
Mary, mary, mary, mary, mary
Mary, mary, mary, mary, mary
Happy just to hear your name
Maryjane do your thang
Mary, mary, mary, mary, mary
Mary, mary, mary, mary, mary
When you sad depressed and feeling strangewho you blame
Need some company to keep you sanecall her name
Maryjane I love you maryjanedo your thang
You're all I need to get me through this thangtrue to game
You ain't never made me stash my thangscratch the brain
Anything you've always kept me tameand it's plain
For me to see that you my everythingmaryjane
Maryjane helps to ease the brainwhen you hang
Through the seasons you ain't never changestayed the same
Never seen what people seen in speedyou became
Naturally you everything we needdo the thang
Do your thang baby true indeed
Do your thang maryjane
Mary, mary, mary, mary, mary
Mary, mary, mary, mary, mary
Happy just to hear your name
Maryjane do your thang
Mary, mary, mary, mary, mary
Mary, mary, mary, mary, mary
Mary, mary, mary, mary, mary
Mary, mary, mary,
Mary, mary, mary, mary, mary
Mary, mary, mary, mary, mary
Mary, mary, mary, mary, mary
Mary, mary, mary, mary, mary
Mary, mary, mary, mary, mary
Mary, mary, mary, mary, mary
