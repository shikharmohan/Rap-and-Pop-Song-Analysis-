Dear Mr. President with all due respect 
I wish we could have a conversation 
I would take a trip done to your residence 
So we could talk about the state of the nation 
Mr. President 
I would ask you about the war 
Really and truly what is it for? 
When an IED makes a soldier fall
Is he dyin'' for somethin' above us all?
Is it all about oil at end of the day? 
Is the pledge of allegiance just something say? 
I hope not I love The USA 
In spite of all drama we have today 
Mr. President are you aware 
Our flesh and blood is dying over there 
When the coffins come back 
Do you care? 
When only the poor kids die 
Is it fair? 
[Chorus] [Wyclef Jean] 
If I could talk to the President 
Would he pay attention really listen? 
If I said something intelligent 
Would he be willing to change his position? 
Now it's time time time 
For me to speak my mind mind mind 
[Verse 2][LL Cool J] 
Don't get me wrong 
I respect the flag 
But it hurts to see a kid in a body bag 
He fought for his country with all he had 
Now we have a family without a dad 
Lil mama cryin' the kids are scared 
9/11 why we were unprepared? 
Mr. President, 
Are you aware unless you're rich, you have poor health care 
It makes you scream and want to pull out your hair 
Discharged from hospitals soon as you get there. 
Mr. President truth or dare 
Terrorist is hiding do you know where? 
Illegal immigrants are everywhere 
Is it really their fault they wanted to come here? 
I respect you please be clear 
Talk with me 
Show the people you care 
[Chorus][Wyclef Jean]
If I could talk to the President 
Would he pay attention really listen? 
If I said something intelligent 
Would he be willing to change his position? 
Now it's Time time time 
For me to speak my mind mind mind 
[Bridge][Wyclef Jean] 
What am I to do 
I've been waitin' on you 
Tell me something that just make sense 
You sent us off to war 
Please be honest what it's for 
Doesn't matter is life or death 
Yeah 
[Verse 3][LL Cool J] 
I'm not republican or democrat 
I'm independent, and I want the facts 
When are the soldiers come back? 
Are we prepared for a terrorist attack? 
Late at night I watch CNN 
Gets so bad I might stop breathin' 
The Middle East hates us 
What's the reason? 
Mr. President 
My heart is bleeding 
I tuck my kids in every evenin' 
Try to teach them to keep believin'
Hopin' my government won't deceive them 
Tell'em set some goals you can achieve them 
Mr. President 
I have to know if die for you 
What will have to show? 
Will it truly help my country grow 
I'm waitinn' for your answer let me know 
[Chorus][Wyclef Jean] 
If I can talk to the President 
Would he pay attention really listen? 
If said somethin' intelligent 
Would he be willing to change his position? 
Now it's time time time 
To speak my mind mind mind 
Now it's Time time time 
To speak my mind mind mind (repeat)
