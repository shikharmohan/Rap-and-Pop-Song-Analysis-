[Charlie Brown]
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Yo check it out, yo Brown, coming up with the sound all around
Check it out, L.O.N.S. for '90 y'all,
Ahhh! What's up? Do I got the hands in the air?
Yo did I make moves, did I make moves?
Yo, ow! Did I make moves yo, so check it out, yo
This is a theory that I've come up with
Between my mind and my heart there's no riff
My story starts off in turtle hawk
Where the Browns bought me sneakers and the back rhyme book
Yo battling for ranks, I didn't have the banks
Ahhhh! Yeah, I simply got to thanks
But yo that was cool cause I kept striving
To go to high school and I kept climbing
A man with a shock from five ten
Gave me promises and dreams, said the contracts would end
For years sweating tears and frustration
Walking and talking, 360 rotations
Oh yeah, Lying Brian, where is your record?
The girls are coming up in a matter of seconds
Ahh! Ahh! Who you think you're fooling?
With those played-out lottos, you know you ain't cooling
Distressed in class, troopers say "Stay up"
It's hard to stay up when they're pulling me down, you know
Times move on, graduation countdown
School with Lion's Den, he's a clown
Imporant, decisions, to make
Years of tears, everything's at stake
I had the strength to believe in me made Charlie B
Take a risk and y'all see
I shot for the stars and you know I caught it
Dinco D, Busta Rhymes, and Milo saw it
Two years of hell, now we're paid off
To prove my rhymes, that it ain't soft
Yo! Elektra selects a new breed to lead them
In the '90 with success and then
Make everyone look leary
Awww! They know, Pinocchio's Theory
Aww! They know, you check it out for the '90
Dinco D, Busta Rhymes, and Milo's in the place to be, check it out
A boy came down every day with the girls
He's jabbering on the mix nonsense
Pinocchio, questions remain
To the likely, notorious win
Ex you're zoning, ahhh!, you're zoning
I made moves, cut cut!
Cut, making move, making move, ahhh!
Clear the rhythm
	A B C D E F G, H I J K L M N O P
	Q R S, T U V, W X Y Z
	Now I know my ABC's, next time won't you sing with me?
"Go on, laugh, make a jackass out of yourself"
