As simple as it sounds
it's as simple as it ought to be
light skin girls lack the dark skin quality
ya don't understand?
You want an explanation?
Well let D-e-L release the frustration
as I see it
every single day
light skin girls ain't satisfied unless they get their way
always
plus they act stuck up
they all add up to one great big phuck up
they try to play suck up
when they want somethin'
then always leave a brother with nothin'
ya think ya look better cause ya skin's a little bit lighter?
You're thinkin' you're my type
like I was a typewriter?
No, ya think ya all-uh-that and all-uh-this
but you ain't really shit
without a makeup kit
see, ya might be light
but ya ugly to me
black is beautiful
to me, that's beauty.

"Dark skin girls are better than light skin, light skin girls ain't
better than dark skin,...
CUBE: I disagree homeboy!"
Now
lets get to the problems
and see if there's a way to solve them
problem #1, has got to be the attitude
which is usually vain, selfish & rude
personality, wit 'er nose stuck up
so don't try talkin' to her
or walkin' with her
to class cause it's out of the question
cause you bein' dark is the wrong complexion
for her,
she wish she was light, though
I mean lighter than light
or as close to white as possible
but I fight to stay a brother
you see,
green and dark skin sisters are the color
this don't apply to all the girls with light skin
just the ones with their heads up their rear end
cause if ya did, static would occur
dark skin cuties is what I prefer
now, look at her
her vision is a blur
cause contact lenses only let ya see Benzes
plus she would fuss & cuss if I tried to talk to her
cause I'm a man who rides the bus
I get frustrated
well, lets say I used to
now a dark & lovely
is who I give juice to
so come on
step to Del if ya with this
this is the facts
so brothers don't forget this.

[INTERLUDE:]
I can't understand
you light skin wenches
ya think ya all that cause ya have long extensions?
Your hair was natural
now ya got played out braids
you woulda looked better with a fade
dark skin girls are so fly, so honest, so sweet
that's the type of girl I wanna meet
complete,
not phony or a fake like you are
see, Del is bolder
I tap you on the shoulder
and say, 'Hey lighty
could you tap that sister for me?'
But you love Mr. Loveable
so you'll just ignore me
so find another tip that you can hop upon
to get with me ya need some sun and some Coppertone
you'll take a white boyfriend before a black one
that's why Del has to stand and attack one
next time you see a girl darker than you
no disrespct when you met her, cause the girl looked better than you.
