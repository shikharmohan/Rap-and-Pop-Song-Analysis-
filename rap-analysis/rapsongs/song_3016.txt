Hey, someone tell me, it's just about over
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah
Someone tell me, it's just about over
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah
Well I'm lonely and no one understands
The show has fallen, into the wrong hands
I am blinded, to see if all that's passed
To know it was possible, to be a sadist
I have nothin', for to give
I have lost my, will live
I lost my pride, lost my joy and now I've lost my fear
I'd rather die because I, am just that, unhappy here
Someone tell me, it's just about over
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah
Someone tell me, it's just about over
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah
It's gettin' hard, to main street, the boulevard
Earth warmin', causin' the ozone to fall apart
Spark rebellion, I'ma go to, guillotine
The Palestines too, divide the land right, between you
Seas cross, dirt road walked a lot of folks that don't talk
Some that thought they made it got caught
Slay the wicked, spirit'll soon fix it
It's gettin' colder I wonder how much older 'fore it's all over
Not long, it was sad, how you killed my son
On the four-zero-five, changin', his flat tire
Suspect's a white male, lead, a possible robbery
Hurts my heart that we start off this year
Like this, players in position to make differences
But be, charged with rape, with all that debit
While you had it, to take the gushy twenties frozen this time
At this north south planet clinic where abortions are performed
From the start, I see the end
Will we be friends in the end
Took you with me, solo creeps
Never wakin' lay next to me sleep
Hate to use you, don't abuse you
I won't lose you, fought to keep you
Dyin' to meet you, confrontation
Tainted thought, of me letin' you step to
I got caught, messin' up again
I just can't win, tryin' not to sin
When crackin' the gin, makin' fat distends
In a time we need to be sober
On my way to Georgia, headed back to Florida
With the Jimmy called peanuts, mind
In O, headed to a show
Gone with the strong, up out the do', now
Someone tell me, it's just about over
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah
Someone tell me, it's just about over
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah
Someone tell me, it's just about over
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah
Someone tell me, it's just about over
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah
Over, over, over, over
Over, over, over, over
