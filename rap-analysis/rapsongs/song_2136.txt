Me and my guys be lurkin' the streets, plottin' upside down, smilin'
Bummin' no matter Skully hoods bandanas bullets
Stockin' caps Ski masks loced out murder one classes
Those who wallop hocked up chopped tatoes permanent creased

And French braids, labeled him sinner look out for that motherfucker
He might rob ya, niggas come tatted up head in a body slang

Doin' for the juggler niggas tryin' to slug ya
Catch a nigga doin' all kinds of nasty things
Ohh, what I feel is mayhem brings
You see us on the block we doin' are thuggin', the gottie
Got the whole cap wonderin', who the fuck shottie?
Lookin' for the body, tell me what they found
His head in Richmond the rest in the V-town
Thinkin' about the set up, tryin' to get my red up

So what the fuck they wanna do
Seem like we got the vas of these niggas
Caught cash and thought we was through
So fuck this old bat shit, I'll get the gat bitch
And probably blow your brains out
Lookin' to get my cap fit
Thinkin' they all acted up
And while I'm at yo ass
I'll probably put the fuckin' slugs

Move up out the plan so I trust no one take nothin' for granted
[Incomprehensible] expanded double 0 chill hillside hillbilly

Uh uh, A element of surprise, getting my gig on
Split yo house in half with a dreadlock wig on
When you do ya hot ones, shoot locus
It's the reflection program dinner rolls, automatic hit the floor
Dump, bust, blast, barefaces
Strike, dip, mass like a mental patience
Run, quick, fast and in a hurry, biaatch
Don't worry forty vision ain't blurry
It's like military issues, make you wish you never got an example
Stalkin' niggas like a bitch do
Can only ride so long with that fake shit I take shit
To the limit with no gimmick in ninety-eight bitch
So fuck what you say and fuck what you play

If I can't keep it real you can kill me so feel me 'cause
I bring things to the game for my scuzzie
We'll kick a niggas door in, hit and lick you brags
Now you ridin' in a fan, pulled tight and gag
Then they pullin' up out the Glad Bags, the hefty type
But you niggas ain't got no kind of idea what
A chopped up body looks like
Then them niggas start to pull down your Levis
And bust you in the head with ruggard P 85's
