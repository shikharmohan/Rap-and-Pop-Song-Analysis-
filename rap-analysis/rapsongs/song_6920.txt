I find it fun to smash emcees into
(Fine bits)
So why I ain't get my just deserts for all the kids I busted, huh?
(Baby)
I crush the courtesy when dealin' with the folks is too much
For the askin'
Cool-I got the
(Skill crafted tools)
Massive fools at my work bench and

The drill's this, I kill swift
I feels I better slay or
(Hey, my tape measures greater)
So now I'm dips if they
(Askin', saw me)
And they was available would they want me to
(Nail'em all?)
Be through, screw drive her crazy
(Screwdriver)
Nuttin', bold, lively
(Put on your high beams)
I, proliferator, quickly fade to niggas vigorous
Figure I kick stunts, I punch twice that nigga that's dissin' at me
Attach 'em to bats, latchin', and matchin' my cataclysm
I give 'em a
(Skism)
I
(Stroke to croak her, I broke her)
Chokin' up on my syntax, as I bend backs by impacts
(Impacts)
Then I give a concussion in your nuts when I'm busting'
(Heads)
Dead with my lead graff
I cloth thee, I off-beat, off the cerebellum, swellin' Nimrods
(Swing)
Ten brains couldn't parallel this
(Ha)
I'm caraouselling kids while they wallow and swallow hallow tips
(Yep)
You follow and slippin'
I'm rippin' mics nice twice like
(Dicin' kids in fractions)
Yo

And abuse two's and three's, who's the G that hoe's know
(Me)
Me and Hiero, I know

So why flow if you're not invigorating
(Why)
I know where you live, there at your crib

(Wack dis, generalizing)
Dissin' before you've ever seen this
So you can get the middle, the penis
(What middle?)
Never the match the miraculous tactics
I smack tricks, the wax is at your wack bitch
(I crack bricks)
Who can't come, I leave 'em broke and dumb
Def, and plus I'm causin' cardiac arrest
You need some rest
(Check)
As I'm chizzlin' your memory
(Riddles in)
Remember me?
I hacked your body to pieces
(Disassembling)
Your
(Blows)
You bros started trembling from shock and trauma
(I'm water)
In lives when I bomb-a babbling dislexic, I make 'em exit
This lifetime, I wake up words
(I excite rhymes)
I'm enthusin' when I'm bruisin'
Hoes, take off your shoes when I abuse men
You're losin'
If you slept on Del
