Let's ride, let's ride
Hey luv, I wanna hold you and talk to you

I've got much more to give than homie do
And you so fine I just wanna roll wit chu
You a queen bitch, need to come close to you
I need a nigga like P to just flow wit chu
And I gotta try 'cuz anything's possible
And you just might see things the way I do
I just wanna get next to you, friends wit you
Burn hunids wake up in the bed wit chu

Pardon my mouth I'm just bein' honest, boo

Kisses and hugs till the next time you swing thru
So many things that I wanna do
Wanna kiss wanna touch, wanna taste, never tease you

And kill any misconception that you got of Mobb Deep
Throw that bug in ya ear and it's about time
'Cuz I nigga like me been wantin' you for years
Bump heads here and there and neva got the chance

Sit back I got this, baby girl ya straight
Fo' sure rest a sure you in the arms of strength

And it's a cold world, yah man don't undastand yah pain
