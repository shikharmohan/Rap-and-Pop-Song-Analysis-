Yeah
Think I'ma try somethin' that I ain't
I ain't never did before on this one
Let's go
Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher
(Let's get higher)
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire
(It's that fire)
Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher
(Let's get higher)
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire
(It's that fire)
Got a little bit of blueberry yum, yum
And I never woulda thought that it could taste this good
Thank God for the man who put it in my hood
It's got me singin' melodies I never thought I would
I'm feelin' sorry for the homies who be smokin' wood
Chop chop, break it down for a player like ye
I'm 'bout to find me a woman and skeet
I'ma keep smokin' 'til I reach my peak
Or 'til I'm stuck and my body feels weak weak
Headed down to the Dungeon, wonderin' if they got some more
And if they don't then I'ma have-ta, settle fa, some 'dro
But it just ain't cool 'cause right on after, I'ma have-ta go
And continue on my mission fishin' for the yum yum but I'm movin' slow
Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher
(Let's get higher)
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire
(It's that fire)
Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher
(Let's get higher)
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire
(It's that fire)
Yes fire fire got me so tired, I'ma stop drop and roll
Put a wet towel under the door, don't pass it I can't take it no more
Somebody take a trip down to the store
Hurry please 'cause I need some snacks
And how long will it take it to get back
Yes indeed, I'm a little off track track
Off this weed and I'm full of that 'gnac
Get on in that stankin' Lincoln, crank it up and ride
And it ain't enough room to fit the other chicks inside
I'm so hungry with the munchies I'ma eat everything in sight
Me and my blueberries together and everything's alright
Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher
(Let's get higher)
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire
(It's that fire)
Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher
(Let's get higher)
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire
(It's that fire)
Get the propane, roll dem thangs and let's blow dis place up
You already know what's up, I mighta had to pay some extra bucks
But I really don't give a fuck
'Cause a brother feels great
But I'm barely awake
All bent out of shape
So stomp on yo' brake
If you tokin' good then all the smokers, let me see your flame
Don't know what you got but my bag'll put yo' stuff to shame
All the different kinds and other flavors, they don't mean a thang
You can't compare it don't stare 'cause I got the ultimate Mary Jane
Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher
(Let's get higher)
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire
(It's that fire)
Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher
(Let's get higher)
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire
(It's that fire)
