Pick up your wings and prepare them to fly
Souljah, souljah, Bone Thug
Souljah, souljah, Bone Thug
Souljah, souljah, Bone Thug
Swing low sweet chariot
Comin' forth to carry me home
Swing low sweet chariot
Comin' forth to carry me home
I looked up on Jordan and what did I see
Comin' forth to carry me home
What did I see
Comin' forth to carry me home
Listen to my battle cry
My battle cry
Listen to my battle cry
My battle cry
One, two look at the telly
They drew my picture with Bob Marley
They probably wanna kill me, will I die?
In 1999 smokin' phillies, Bizzy the kid
Was bustin' in the ceilin' in my big claim
Kickin' on somethin' and dig this
Got to feel it, catch and don't let go
Wretched in a fro, Bone watchin' for the po po
Roll over, then pull it, got my bullet in my fo fo
Gotta stand, it's turnin' to a jungle
Comin' out a 4-door Benz and I spend a lot for show
No, no, don't spend a lot contend with a men
Lookin' at my watch like a meal ticket
Arrest the block, they couldn't pin it, better send it
For the cops absorb you soul of course, praise to the Pharaoh
Murder mo, curly, I heard it lower and return it burn
When our niggas still shermed out
Court's adjourned, court's adjourned, rest and burn
I can't sleep at night 'cause I lay in my bed
And I be tossin' and turnin' tryin' to avoid my dreams
And I can hear the niggas lettin' off they lead around the corner
Got me feelin' paranoia like they comin' for me
And I be clutchin' my heat, got me pacin' back and forth
So much shit on my mind, so many things to do
So little time a nigga really got to do it in
Man, I be ready for war in my fatigues and boots
From the minute nigga step outside
Nina Ross on my hip and I gots to pack one
Just like Little Eazy-E told you and me
"Nigga, never leave the house without packin' a gun"
And that's real, leave it for the dollar bill
Niggas'll holler, "Kill, kill", then start flexin'
When the shit poppin' off in my direction
Nigga got a 17-shot for protection
Life ain't no joke
Too many niggas I know was takin' shit for granted and that's foul
Nigga, if you see a fool, pick a fool right out the crowd
And hit him dead in his mouth for bein' loud and wild
Shit is real
Ain't none of that elastic fagot rubber band plastic shit
Muthafuckas in the battlezone blastin' shit
Put the match on shit, straight up gassin' shit
It's that same nigga runnin' with the AK-47
Bustin' niggas in the belly
Give them muthafuckas more than just a headache
Get back at that nigga faster than Fed-Ex
They're runnin', retreatin', screamin', "Mayday, we're goin' down"
Now why the fuck is niggas tellin' lies and rumors?
Talkin' about we split up
'Cause I see Krayzie, Layzie, Bizzy, Wish, Flesh
Niggas really need to shut that shit up
If a muthafucka really wanna rumble, he could tumble
We wilder than any animal that's in the jungle
The name of the game is 'Block the basket, strike him out'
Hit the goal make the quarterback fumble
Strategize, any nigga hatin' ain't a friend of mine
Nigga considered the enemy, nigga, that's when you die
I never keep my enemies close
'Cause I got a perfect view of 'em in my scope, that's close enough
Leather Face'll fuck a nigga up and smile
And hit 'em with the millimeter and I show a bitch kill a nigga
See me drivin', bitch, come on and try to rob me
I'm willin' to bet that 'cha get lit up
Get off of me, baby, keep on comin' and there's gon' be drama
Tellin' you niggas, you better not fuck with me
'Cause I ain't that quiet nigga that I used to be
Look how the haters give a nigga attitude
Nigga, sick of bein' humble
Now I'm like fuck that I gotta get mine
They try to show a nigga love but fuck that it ain't no love
'Cause in the game you get fucked every time
You get this feelin' inside my bloodline
Somebody finna get fucked up
If a nigga don't get some satisfaction
Blastin' like a madman
Gettin' with the static nigga lovin' the action
Yeah, my Bone Thug niggas, come on
If any one of you niggas got any problems
Thinkin' you tough and you really wanna solve 'em
Don't be mumblin', speak a little louder
While you steady talkin' like you're louder than the next nigga
We'll already be up in you
Now hater feel us, who the realest? The Bone Thug killas
If there's any objections, nigga deal with 'em
Realer than them other muthafuckas talkin' about they thugs
Jumpin' all on the bandwagon
Wanna be like us, wanna cuss, wanna bust they guns
Thugged out with they pants saggin'
They actin' but when it's really time to show some tactics
The niggas don't have 'em, we murdered the bastards
Put 'em all in body bags and caskets
Drop 'em in the river, splash, that's that ass
'Cause when we clash, ain't no comin' back
Huntin' niggas from the past, we gon' settle this shit right here
Fight to whoever blood be spilled first
Who will be the nigga ridin' away in a hearse?
Not me, I'm determined to wake up
And still be livin' in the mornin', you feelin' me?
Quicker than a clocked damn missile
Hit a bitch directly in the middle, right between your eye
Then we makin' sure that nigga die
Shoot a couple more times and ride out, ride out, ride out
Nigga, we ride out, ride out, ride out
Nigga, we ride out, ride out, ride out
Nigga, we ride out, ride out
