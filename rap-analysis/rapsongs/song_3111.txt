I got my locs on, I got my locs on
You can't see my eyes
You can't see my eyes
I got my locs on, I got my locs on
You can't tell I'm high, you can't tell I'm high
I got my locs on, I got my locs on
You can't see my eyes
You can't see my eyes
I got my locs on, I got my locs on
You can't tell I'm high, you can't tell I'm high
I got my locs on, welcome to the cherry dome
I got them carrots on givin' off them faromones
Women love it when they see me on that motocycle
Niggas hate it 'cause they know makin' more than Michael
Been ballin' since the word ballin' played out
They brought it back to describe me in that mayback
Me and Jezzy Jezzy rollin' wit our locs on
Smokin' somthin', good fuckin' up the ozone
I got my locs on, I got my locs on
You can't see my eyes
You can't see my eyes
I got my locs on, I got my locs on
You can't tell I'm high, you can't tell I'm high
Brand new socks ran me a buck fidy
It must of set u back naw baby, not really
Shut your ls ya the choppers just silly
When it bustin' at your ass mean it laughin' at you really
I got my locs on dickis on, keep the workin' niggas on
Keep the cash at Vicky's home, yeah, she keep them dickis on
Keep my locs on, I see you hatin' mothfuckers
Keep my locs on u know they match my black trucka
I got my locs on, I got my locs on
You can't see my eyes
You can't see my eyes
I got my locs on, I got my locs on
You can't tell I'm high, you can't tell I'm high
I got my locs on 'cause my eyes are burgeny
And when I get home I don't want the 3rd degree
The 3rd to be urgen me, these niggas want to murbed me
They scared of the consequences comin' from my defenses
It ain't that expensive, have your ass hopin' fences
Lucky mothafucka missed your ass by some inches
Next time understand what you fuckin' with is legendary status
Sittin' behind these glasses nigga
I got my locs on, I got my locs on
You can't see my eyes
You can't see my eyes
I got my locs on, I got my locs on
You can't tell I'm high, you can't tell I'm high
