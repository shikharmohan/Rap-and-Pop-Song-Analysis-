Escape the killing fields
Escape the killing fields
Escape the killing fields
Escape the killing fields
Here we go
I'm movin' off death row
You gotta keep up hops
You can't be slow
'Cause their towers are high
They got the hype gats
Check the perimeters good
Read the maps
It's night
They might not see us
'Cause if they catch us out there
They'll bleed us
Shoot us, kill us
Dump us in a dark ditch
Clean it up, call it a gang hit
I gotta make my move
'Cause I'm a renegade
I recognize
When mind techniques
Are being played
It's a plot they use
To keep down another
Here comes another
Brainwashed brother
Shut up, do you know
How dumb you sound?
That mentality
What keeps my people down
Nobody wants to
Live in an urban war
You live there 'cause
Your parents were poor
They live there because
Theirs were also
Get yourself together
Hit the gates bro
You gotta get out
You gotta get out, why?
You gotta get out
You gotta get out, why?
You gotta get out
You gotta get out, why?
'Cause the fields
Are where you die
Escape from the killing fields
Escape from the killing fields
Escape from the killing fields
Escape from the killing fields
You try to keep us
Runnin' and runnin' faster
But I ain't runnin' from ya
I'm runnin' at ya
And my posse's thick
About a mil strong
Too late to make up now
'Cause it's on
I'm the one that's got ya
In constant fear
I'm the nigga
You shoulda killed last year
But you played yourself
You let me gain wealth
Now I can change the way
The cards are dealt
I've schooled my homeboys
Made 'em all understand
The tricks and twists
Inflicted on the black man
How ya make me think
To be down
I gotta stay around
Down in the motherfuckin'
Battleground
There'll never be any good
Schools in the hood
There'll never be any cops
That are any good
The hospital is a great place
To go to die
Real estate's cheap
Let me tell ya why?
The man's got a
Sure fire system
An economic prison
You gotta get out
You gotta get out, why?
You gotta get out
You gotta get out, why?
You gotta get out
You gotta get out, why?
'Cause the fields
Are where you die
