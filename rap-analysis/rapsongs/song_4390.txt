---- Verse 2---- 
Ridin' in the caddy mo' 
Blowin like sachmo 
I'm highly strapped low 
Baby go from what ya know 
Tinteds turn pictures change new photo different frame 
Money up, champagne, still posin', same game 
Cash money still, do it for the money 
Gotta black car, grey car, gas car, green car 
backyard theme park, front yard car show 
I'm somewhere in the house 
and it's like where's waldo? 
ten bricks straight powder air cargo 
Weezy F. straight hustlin' no barcode 
You don't know what my heart holds, straight fuel 
Take ya bitch from the club make her ass a mule 
Put some weight on her back make her ass move 
She give daddy money back that's a fast move 
40 G's one chain, that's a man jewels 
45 for the Jag dude 
----Chorus---- 
hey where we from, new orleans

and what we drink? (drank)

----Verse 3---- 
Uh, smooth out my mansion to my whip 
I leave the bullshit inside wit my bitch 
I move the heavy ass gun from my hip 
Then I sit the same heavy ass strap on my lap 
I'm steady as crack wit the strap 
I'm heavy as da-white but Dwayne not fat 
I'm right like Betty and the fetti is the facts 
The Birdman Junior holla back where ya stack 
I'm just tryin' to let my hair back 
And chill where they got some air at, Ya hear dat? 
Champagne clear liquor put that beer back 
Got work so cheap it's on Sears racks 
Holla at me on the low I take care of that 
And feds buy mixtapes yeah I'm aware of that 
But this here is the suffix you scared of dat 
When you get shot you know where ya at
and where we from NEW ORLEANS
