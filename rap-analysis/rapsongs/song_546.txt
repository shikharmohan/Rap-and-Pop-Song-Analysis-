Them callin' me Mr. Bill Collector
Needin' me money, know he's up tonight
See niggas can't stand us
So they label us scandalous
And if them runnin' off with-a-me cash
That ass gonna have to pay the price
Nigga muthafucka po po
Gotta hit 'em with the fo' fo'
Don't be fuckin' with my money
Nigga, no
See when Krayzie pull the pump, then I kill 'em all
Pump slugs
When blood hit the wall, watch 'em fall
Now, dog, who ya gonna call?
Puttin' niggas in the coffin where they probably better off, and
Leathaface is not a punk-bitch
So a nigga just can't fuck me
Nigga better have me cash or I kill his whole family
When the twelve gauge pump blast
Now, test me
Never ever let a nigga ride
When he think he fin to slide, pump him in the spine
Get him for the money
Nigga tried to play me and dash
And that's why me thugs should put slugs in that ass
They telly and me never want to see no
Oh jealous muthafucka tried to keep a nigga's ends low
If he scared to smoke a primo
Gotta go whether fiends in the clique that's a no no
Gotta make that money, man
Gimme all my change
It's a murder thang, now
Even in the dummy game, niggas comin' up slain for collectin' they claim
Now, Leathaface, me pick up me gauge, grab the mask
And, nigga, me blast, so ya better respect us
When you see the bill collector rippin'
Killin' niggas for that mad money thang
Niggas steady payin' them dues, runnin' with trues
Nothin' to lose, everything to prove
Little thug from the C-Town, never caught sleepin'
Always on the come up creepin', runnin' this shit, now
Puttin' that Bone down
Gotta let a nigga know for the love of cheese, movin' thangs in the '95
Rollin' with Ruthless, thuggin' with my niggas from the Clair
And we smokin' them green leaves
Fuck with me, now
Oh, nigga, don't test Rest, Strate, Leathaface in the place on a mission
Don't be messin' with my bankroll
Niggas wanna gank on Bone, so I stack them prank hoes
And I'm bettin' on me takin' no more losses
Put 'em in a coffin, and they life is better off
And these niggas, they don't know me, they can't know me
Thought you had a homie, but ya fuckin' with the muthafuckin' Bone, see
Nigga, gotta get me mine on the nine-nine
In the '95, bodies droppin'
When you hear my pistol select ya dome, respect that true house
Or underground shit, Mr. Bill Collector, Bone
Them callin' me Mr. Bill Collector
Needin' me money, know he's up tonight

Nigga, take it off, thank you
Please don't make me stack ya
Time to pay the bill, write your check up all night
Catch a slug or chill
Bill collectors, better respect them Mo Thugs
Sellin' drugs, pumpin' slugs all up in that rectum, check 'em
Click-click, fall to the ground
When the glock pop, make your chest pump blood
And takin' too long, better drop it on down
Or ya catchin' two to the head
Shoulda gave 'em up, bitch, to the Mo Thug lunatic quick to pop
Now, you're dead, yeah
Gotta pull that nine on the niggas every time
Sellin' rocks on the nine-nine
Gotta put him on the pave
If ya want to die, put 'em in the grave, better give me all them dimes

And get away with me llello
I see me, the murderer
I didn't want to take his life

I didn't want to take his life
But the nigga tried to run
And get away with me llello

Sawed-off pumpin', dumpin' steadily
All the way to the other side we ride
Sherm, when I hit that chrome and now
Niggas is 'bout to die
Thugsta theivin' off in Cleveland
And I couldn't sell out my city
Murder now to come up, move
Bone'll be bringin' that city, with me, pin me
Nigga, this the team, by the way, don't fuck with brains
Put in my mind off onto my murder
Murder y'all all, and I flees the scene clean
And I'm out to fade 'em
Hey, and I'm out for money, gauged 'em
Better pray to save 'em, but it won't any good, now
Bang, bang
Caution to loss in me brain, get 'em up off the 'caine
Bang, kill a nigga
Bang, peel a trigger
Bang, comin' up out to wet 'em, man
Off with the blood, put 'em in the mud with a slug
Thug gotta get paid
Reachin' on back as we bail to pick up me shells
I slip in the buck, and the gauge spray
Sawed-off on the block, cocked, ready to pop ya, now
'Cause broke gets played, this dope get paid, and nigga
Come drop it down
Them callin' me Mr. Bill Collector
Needin' me money, know he's up tonight
See niggas can't stand us
So they label us scandalous
And if them runnin' off with-a-me cash
That ass gonna have to pay the price

Your rent's due, muthafucka
