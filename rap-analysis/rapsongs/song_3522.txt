Heavy hitter for life
Heavy hitters for life
You rappers think I give a fuck about the way the day spit
Want to be on my album but don't want me on they shit
Everybody thought I was makin' a compilation
I was really makin' myself they competition
Fresh off the plane form the all star game
Bone girls on TV, so it's all star trains
Just picture, man, no stichin', man
Somethin' for the phiends fresh out the kitchen, man
Last 9/11 I was poor on a half 'til I floored up my math
Now it's Porsche 9/11 and I'm floorin' the gas
Got a lot a problems, money one that I not have no more
Well Dame, look at how everybody den changed
All my niggas is 'bout to have it made
Tell J that I'm 'bout to change the game
This makes everything else sound played
Goddamn Kanye! Kanye! Kanye!
Now hold up
Ain't nobody messin' with me dog, now you say it
Ain't nobody messin' with you at all
I told, "Dude, you can't even rap on my interlude"
Now does that make me as rude as Jude?
When the album comin' out, man, the people is askin'
Y'all got motive Adidas, ya sick with the fashion
Ya already got doe, so ya spit for the passion
The way ya rhymes give me Tribe Called Quest flash backs
And let's not even bring up the tracks, man
Nope, nope, let's not do that, man
Ya eatin' up the game like Pac, man
And got the whole world shakin' just like crack phiends
Heavy hitters for life
Roca fella is for life
Throw them diamonds up
Throw them diamonds up
Trow ya diamonds
