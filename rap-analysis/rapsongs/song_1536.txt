Oh Johnny, you got a bullet in your forehead, boy
Don't you understand, you're dead?
Buried six feet under the concrete
Ooh aww oh
That's the noise he made when he got shot
But Johnny's still dead, still dead
Thought about his mama
Thought about his father Josephine
But nobody could help the boy
When he hit the concrete
"Ooh aww oh"
The last words said by Johnny
But now he's six feet under and he's dead
