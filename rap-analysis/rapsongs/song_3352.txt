Watch me flip and rip on the freedom tip
Open your mind, see the point of the ice pick
I stand tall, while my brothers still choose to crawl
Black power, it's in effect you all, but you don't understand
You're still a slave to the man, prepare for revolution
Some sucker say we're free, I gotta disagree
Half my posse's in the penitentiary
So, I'm a drop and kick the science with defiance
Because, I have no alliance with suckas who choose
Not to act black, when they are black
Get out my face with that, you better ease back
Because Mandela did twenty seven hard ones
Not in a windowed room, but in a barred one
While his wife had tears in her eyes
The man is a hero, he needs a Nobel prize
But that will never happen
So I'm gonna keep rappin', freein' my brothers' minds
From their entrapment
To silence the ice, they'll probably put a bullet in me
But I'm prepared to die and Mandela's free
