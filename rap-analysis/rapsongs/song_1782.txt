Check my dangerous slang atrocious
When I let these nuts hang focus it's Wu Tang
What the fuck's a Hootie and the Blowfish
I wave my black flag at the roaches
Who approaches these twin supersoakers
Who have poisonous darts for culprits
Too late to get your blow gun un-holstered
You're left buttered up and lightly toasted
So what I drink and smoke too much
So what I cuss too much shut the fuck up
Yo, yo now when we roll
You motherfuckers tuck in your gold
'Cuz for the platinum I'm jackin' niggas up in Limos
It ain't nothin' for bullets to unbutton your clothes
Description yellow male tissue up in his nose
You bitches swing the vine on the bathroom nuts
I'm hairy as hell outta hell and tattooed up
I'm a dog only fuck in the bathroom, what?
In high school I dealt only with the classroom sluts
My name is Johnny, Donnie, Brasco
Tuck the gat low cut your cash flow
Yell if you want money funny
A hungry dummy snatch crumbs from me
Doc and Hot Niks bodies in the mosh pit
Yo, and I'm the D.O you lookin' at the raw invented
On Friday I spit thirty-five to forty minutes
Smell up the bathroom like Craig Paul was in it
Endin' up on your back wu swords up in it
Anyone can match me I crack 'em all to Guinness
Fuck how many thugs players and ballers in it
Brick City Shaolin better call us sinners
Boys that'll run up in your wife, maul and spill it
Yo we said c'mon!
Move in now move out
Hands up now hands down
Back up back up
Tell me what you gonna do now
Breathe in now breathe out
Hands up now hands down
Back up back up
Tell me what you gonna do now
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'
It just don't get no darker than that kid with the barker
Bald head with the boots who shoots to make it spark
I'm a fair nigga but ain't nann nigga
Quicker than the hand trigga so if you dare nigga
It'll be like your man tryin' to hold your brain to your head
But you'll be shittin' on yourself 'cuz you already dead
And at the funeral you won't need a casket
Leavin' just enough of him to stuff in a basket
Just get the casket I really need my ass kicked
My mom never let me forget that I'm a bastard
I ain't never been shit and ain't gon' be shit
That's why I taste shit whenever I see shit
It's just that D shit D's short for do what I wanna do
And that's what I'm gonna do right here in front of you
And I'll be runnin' you and your man straight up out
And y'all niggas ain't runnin' a fuckin' thing but your mouth
Move in now move out
Hands up now hands down
Back up back up
Tell me what you gonna do now
Breathe in now breathe out
Hands up now hands down
Back up back up
Tell me what you gonna do now
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'
You wanna mess with Limp Bizkit
You can't mess with Limp Bizkit
Because we get it on every day and every night
See this platinum thing right here?
Well we doin' it all the time
So you better get some better beats
And uh, get some better rhymes
You really really really wanna get shit started
Well people everywhere just get retarded
Get retarded get retarded people everywhere just get retarded
