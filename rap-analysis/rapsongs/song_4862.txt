Ooh you feel that as I take you to them dirt roads
Deep down in your southern roots
When nobody said life was going to be easy
And we travel through this emotional roller coaster called life
And we have our ups and downs
Just keep in mind when you hit rock bottom
There ain't nowhere to go but up baby
It's just all you about how you deal wit it you feel me
Listen here
When life seems hopeless, it make a nigga lose focus
Empty beer bottles and roaches
Helps to get it off my chest, 'cause I'm so stressed
And all I here is "Fuck da world"
When life seems hopeless, it make a nigga lose focus
Empty beer bottles and roaches
Helps to get it off my chest, 'cause I'm so stressed
And all I here is "Fuck da world"
Man ever since life's been a gamble
My life been in shambles
Double edge sword burnin' both sides of the candle
But Cris you can't handle the truth
Don't wanna face reality
So Lord accept my apology
Please like when police say freeze
And I ain't do shit
But I'm down on my knees
It's a crooked system but gin straight take the pain away
I charge the game
And put my problems on lay away
A black man but I feel so blue
So I smoke green and purple 'til my dreams come true
Then my eyes turn red, the sky turns gray
Children slangin' white in the hood, we call it yeah
Drink old gold, down my yellow brick road
Then rewrite my script until my story's untold
See I got a little money and my life sped up
Now I'm fallin' and I can't get up
When life seems hopeless, it make a nigga lose focus
Empty beer bottles and roaches
Helps to get it off my chest, 'cause I'm so stressed
And all I here is "Fuck da world"
When life seems hopeless, it make a nigga lose focus
Empty beer bottles and roaches
Helps to get it off my chest, 'cause I'm so stressed
And all I here is "Fuck da world"
I had this dream about a dope fiene
And it's strange cause he can barely write or read
But seemed to get folks about anything
Curious about him I wanted to talk to him
But he was to busy for that
But I was more then welcome to walk with him
So as we walked, he talked and I just listen
He said, "There's a big difference between crackas and niggas"
See he said, "White folks look out for the white folks"
But uh black folks blame otha black folks
When they ain't enough black roaks
But yo to make a long story short
We need pay more attention and do things
That's way more convincing and he told me
You know I wouldn't say something that wouldn't work and I
Damn sure wouldn't waste my time telling something that a hurt you
But you would fall for anything if you don't stand for something
But that's for certain but niggas don't be listenin'
And that shit be hurting and uh
Not all of us, but some of us
And if we don't hurry up
They going to bury each and every one of us
When life seems hopeless, it make a nigga lose focus
Empty beer bottles and roaches
Helps to get it off my chest, 'cause I'm so stressed
And all I here is "Fuck da world"
When life seems hopeless, it make a nigga lose focus
Empty beer bottles and roaches
Helps to get it off my chest, 'cause I'm so stressed
And all I here is "Fuck da world"
Sometimes I can't deal with my daily issues just being sober
Life's a bitch and I can't control her
I wish I could and sometimes to cry on we need a shoulder
The government stand us up to run us over
And in the hood they don't seem to understand, goddamn
What it's really got me wondering if it's a part of a bigger plan
Man I smell something fishy going on
And its way beyond blowin' away the smoke
From all these swishers goin' on
It ain't much I can do about it but preach the word
Tell my people to spend ya money wisely
Don't be obscured by some things that's appreciated
Like a home to open ya eyes to what's the fuck's goings on
'Cause they constantly getting rid of us
One by one whether it's drugs or disease or gun by gun
I ain't no saint either I feel that I'm even doing wrong
By using what's in this chorus to get through this song
When life seems hopeless, it make a nigga lose focus
Empty beer bottles and roaches
Helps to get it off my chest, 'cause I'm so stressed
And all I here is "Fuck da world"
When life seems hopeless, it make a nigga lose focus
Empty beer bottles and roaches
Helps to get it off my chest, 'cause I'm so stressed
And all I here is "Fuck da world"
You kno' ya'll going to mess around and keep on complaining bout slavery
That was over 40-50 years ago black folks need to move on stay strong
Ya'll keep playin' with a cracker, they going to have yo ass tied up
Wired up on them back roads of South Florida Georgia
And they made them laws, so they can't do nothing for you
Can a church get an Amen? And God for the thugs too Amen
