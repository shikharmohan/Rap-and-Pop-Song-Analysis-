See it's two type of bitches in the world
You got a broke bitch, you got a rich bitch
That would explain what I am
And what my girl, Missy is
We the rich muthafuckin' bitches
That's right
And then you got a bitch like me
Who just stand above all bitches
That excludes my girl Missy, Mary
You know what sayin'?
But y'all know what the fuck I mean
I'm the queen bitch, that's right muthafucka, what?
Y'all got a problem wit it, come see me
A muthafucka' ain't takin' my title
Or my girl Missy title
Or my girl Mary title, what? That's right
See only bitches like us
Is allowed to play a game of chess
You see, a real queen needs a king
You damn muthafuckin' right
I don't want a nigga laying up under me
That can't do for me
What I can't do for my muthafuckin' self
So when y'all see me in the street?
This is what I want y'all to do
Fix your lips, put 'em together nicely and say
Say it along, say it along now, say
"She's a bitch!"
I was walkin' real slow to the dance floor
He was lookin' at my ass and I turned him on
I seen him talking to his boy on the cellular phone
I looked at him and all he could say was
"Damn baby, bring it on"
I talk shit but I come through like a storm
I keep my piece so sweet, yeah nice and warm
And all he could feel, was this love baby
I don't give a fuck
About what they think, what they say
They can call me a freak
Call me anything they wanna name
I don't give a, I don't give a
I just wanna take him home
Take him to the house then turn him out
He ain't checkin' for you
I don't give a fuck
About what they think, what they say
They can call me a freak
Call me anything they wanna name
I don't give a, I don't give a
I just wanna take him home
Take him to the house then turn him out
He ain't checkin' for you
