I'm not a hunter but I am told that, uh, in places like in the Arctic
Where indigenous people sometimes might, might, hunt a wolf
They'll take a double-edged blade and they'll put blood on the blade
And they'll melt the ice and stick the handle in the ice
So that only the blade is protruding
And that a wolf will smell the blood and wants to eat
And it will come and lick the blade trying to eat
And what happens is when the wolf licks the blade
Of course, he cuts his tongue and he bleeds
And he thinks he's really having a good thing
And he drinks and he licks and he licks
And, of course, he is drinking his own blood and he kills himself
That's what the Imperialists did with us with crack cocaine
You have these young brothers out there
Who think they are getting something they gonna make a living with
They is getting something they can buy a car
Like the white people have cars, why can't I have a car?
They getting something, they can get a piece of gold
White people have gold, why can't I have gold?
They getting something to get a house
White people have a house, why can't I have a house?
And they actually think that there's something
That's bringing resources to them
But they're killing themselves just like the wolf was licking the blade
And they're slowly dying without knowing it
That's what's happening to the community, you with me on that?
That's exactly, precisely what happens to the community
And instead of blaming the hunter who put the damn handle
And blade in the ice for the wolf
That's what happens is the wolf gets the blame
Gets the blame for trying to live
That's what happens in our community
You don't blame the person, the victim, you blame the oppressor
Imperialism, white power is the enemy
Was the enemy when it first came to Africa
And snatched up the first African brothers here against our will
Is the enemy today and that's the thing that we have to understand
