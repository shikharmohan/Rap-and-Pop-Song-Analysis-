[Jermaine Dupri]:
What?
Y'all thought we wasn't gonna make a remix to this
I want y'all to bounce wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me
Bounce
Brat, Missy, JD
Come on
[Missy Elliott]:
Yo, come here baby, let me kiss ya
Let me see what'cha bought when I'm wit'cha
Let me see what'cha talkin bout big shot
If you got that doe, can I get some?
Let me see that Benz, can I drive, dude?
Can I have when I ride right beside you?
Oh, side by side, I got my crew
Oh, you act a little funny nigga, fuck you
Cause I'm that bitch wit the six shots
Six blocks, big knots, big tick-tocks
Drop tops, shit won't stop
Y'all flop when Miss' drop, I rock {*dogs bark and growl*}
I'm gon' get'chall
Bang bang to the boogie, take a picture
Of a hot girl and big time
Wit a thong, it's on when I hit'chall
That's what I'm lookin for
[Jermaine Dupri]:
Uh
Yo
I'm lookin for a bitch that'll switch that thang
from right to left like no other
Type of girl that'll blow your BRAIN
Wanna rock your CHAIN
Make you wanna take to meet your mother
No matter what baby keeps it NAME BRAND
Never let a nigga change her GAME PLAN
Even though it might look like she switch up
Everynight honey fucks with the SAME MAN
Hit the mall, get fresh just LIKE I DO
Wanna have wild sex just LIKE I DO
Bottle to the neck just LIKE I DO 
That's what I'm lookin for
She gotta be jazzy (uh-huh, uh-huh)
But when she do her thang it's ghetto style
Tellin me "JD, nigga say my name."
Like she a new member of Destiny's Child
I like those that got hair but still rock a weave
Know just what to do to make a nigga not leave (OH) 
Know just what to wear to make a nigga go dream 
Know just what to say to get the bling (That's what I'm lookin for) 
For others she won't but WILL FOR ME
Come in and pay some of these BILLS FOR ME
Not just standin around lookin REAL PRETTY
I'm talkin bout a bitch that'll KILL FOR ME 
(That's what I'm lookin for)
(Jermaine Dupri Chorus)
Where my thong wearin shorties at?
Got the game down packed
Got their own car, little crib and a doe stack
That's what I'm lookin for
They know just what a brotha needs 
How to throw it and make him not wanna leave
When it's time to go down, they ain't scared to freak
That's what I'm lookin' for
And where my Proda wearin shorties who
claim they don't love you
But anytime you want somethin done, they'll do it
That's what I'm lookin for
Them 4, 5, 6 types
Down to do it all night
See that there, is the type of bitch I like
That's what I'm lookin for
[Da Brat]:
Oh yeah
See me, I like a big, buff nigga, get tough nigga
Sex me rough 'til I beg to get up nigga
What's up?
You got a hot cars?
I'm-a need to ride find WHAT I'M LOOKIN FOR
To bump these hot boys, let me get the Visa
So I can Discover your MasterCard
Let's cruise the beach and then park the yacht 
at the dock at the beaches
Don't stop, got nothin but hot releases
A thug by my side cause I need em
Forget any reason I give
He'll stop a nigga from breathin cause he lives for me 
Dedicated to Brat only
That sexy smile, personality, my COMPLEXION give a nigga ERECTIONS
Condom in the bra for MY PROTECTION 
Tell ya at the end let me get it LaShaun
What's my name?
BRAT!!
And I can fuck all night to the break of dawn
Lookin for me, a thug that's ready to get it on
I'm like em athletic down to sweat 
Cause he gotta get it
Cut, split it and wet it, servin me cause he loves to get it
And it tastes so good he'll never forget 
Believe me when I spit
It's the part that moves his body (come on)
(Missy Elliott & Lil'Mo Chorus x 1)
Move your body, move to the music
Grab somebody, keep it movin
Get up on the dance floor, shake your thang now
Everybody in the club 
That's what I'm lookin for
(Da Brat Chorus x 1)
Where my rollie wearin thugs who
claim they don't love you
But anytime you want somethin done they'll do it
That's what I'm lookin for
The ball all night type, frontin, screamin thug life
That's the type of nigga I like
That's what I'm lookin for
(Missy Elliott & Lil'Mo Chorus x 1)
