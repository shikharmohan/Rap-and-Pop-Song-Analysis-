Yeah, yeah, it's like what you gonna do
When we come through when you
Yeah, shock body like
What you gonna do when we come through, Kweli
Uh, yeah, BK MC, like what you gonna do
When we come through when you
Woo, yeah, come on
Watch how Talib Kweli Greene do it
What I bring to it
You hear the theme music
My rhymes' life support, dog breathe to it
Rhymes are bright, the sunshine beams through it
Stop haters in their tracks like high beams
Like the moment you was at the crime scene screamin', "I ain't do it"
But, I seen through it, it's obscene how I spew it
Martin Luther King had a dream to it, people cling to it
I seen your momma lean to it in a green Buick
Wack niggas get passed over so much they seem Jewish
Better leave and do it now or seem foolish
This music I bleed to it, I raise my seeds to it
I MC with the truest in the game
I stay hungry like I'm the newest in the game
And stay hot like I'm bluish with the flame
You heard the truth when it came
And you knew it was the name that you couldn't pronounce
Now I'm all up in your mouth
My people all up in the house and we calling you out
Y'all niggas cryin', what you bawlin' about
This shit is down like we chalkin' you out
Hey yo, that's what I'm talkin' about
(Look up in the sky, recognize it's sunshine)
Yeah, what you gonna do when we come through when you
(How can you deny when it's right in your eyes)
Shock body, rock body
Like what you gonna do when we come through when you
(Look up in the sky, recognize it's sunshine)
Come on and, come on and
Kweli like what you gonna do when we come through when you
(How can you deny when it's right in your eyes)
Yeah, come on
Check the writin' skills forever comin' tight with the quill
You sound like you likin' the thrill
Or fillin' the pipe with the the krill
You must be smokin' like the spliff we like to light when we build
Out of respect for the dead, we let our Heinekens spill
Cats takin' Vicatin pills to numb the pain that they feelin'
Pertainin' to stealin' my rhymes, findin' their brains on the ceilin'
I'm blowin' their minds wide open, when I'm flowin' I'm fine
Hey, yo my whole style bangin' like I'm throwin' up signs
Niggas get cut like I saw someone I know in the line
I live life to the fullest, 'cause I know I could die
Right now, I don't believe I know when to sto'
My face soldier's going to lie, when I'm goin' to buy
You gonna see a rainbow in the sky
And my mommas face glowin' with pride
My first born held it down and through my baby's soul I survive
Put your hands in the air and let me know you're alive
I love this game y'all, I ain't even goin' to lie
I can see you all rockin', 'cause you know when it's live, word
(Look up in the sky, recognize it's sunshine)
Shock body, rock body
Like what you gonna do when we come through when you
(How can you deny when it's right in your eyes)
Yeah, grab it like what you gonna do when we come through when you
(Look up in the sky, recognize it's sunshine)
Come on and, come on and
Now, what you gonna do when we come through when you
(How can you deny when it's right in your eyes)
Yeah, feelin' that you
Now, what you gonna do when we come through when you
Put your hands together, everybody now, come on
BK, BX, Q borough, like what you gonna do when we come through
ATL, Chi-Town, Los Angeles, Bay Area
Everybody like, what you gonna do when we come through yeah
The whole world rocking
Yo, BK like, what you gonna do when we come through, Kweli
(Look up in the sky, recognize it's sunshine)
Yeah, feelin' that is
Like what you gonna do when we come through when you, everybody
(How can you deny when it's right in your eyes)
Put your hands up in the mornin' skylight
Everybody's like, what you gonna do when we come through when you
