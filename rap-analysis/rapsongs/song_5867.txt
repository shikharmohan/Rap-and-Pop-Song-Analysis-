My thoughts are thunderin' tumblin'
Sons of bitches switches from yellin' ya mumbling
You ain't a pal of me my family ties but not wit Mallory
My analogy ain't for salary as I roll reality through galaxies
Four centuries it's sent to me with the scent of oil
Witta chain representing penitentiaries
From Roman town to Boren town, from Newark to Ill town
And all you know from lifers, Rikers ta foe some
Wasn't drivin' to fast, I was flying to low
You think I'm rockin' too quick, I think you're listenin' to slow
I'm abruptin' construction, a pumping assumption
You diss while your family say I'm the best shit since fuckin'
Struckin' 'bout an obstruction or turnin' somethin' of nothin'
From more things to more things, it's the rip in every function
Funkin' it up, pumpin' it up, chumpin' the ducks
Lookin' ta hump Ms. Junk in the trunk, pump pumpin' me up
Jersey niggas are the craziest, New York niggas are the craziest
D.C. niggas are the craziest, Philly niggas are the craziest
L.A. niggas are the craziest, Chi town niggas are the craziest
Texas niggas are the craziest, Utah niggas are the craziest
My lyrics be laced with 40 ounces of funk and stuff
You get rushed, you get bust
You call yourself callin' my bluff, enoughs enough
I'm puttin' it down on the real end
This one goes out to all the people who be questionin'
My skills, niggas I been rockin' since lee twillz
And we feel that we build careers of steel
So all the rest come up and test
But only stress is what you'll find thinkin'
Vinnie don't write and Vinnie can't rhyme shrinkin'
The sleepin' MC I eat like good 'n' plenty
Lyrically spankin' ya that's why they call me Uncle Vinnie
And oh yes, I just appeal to the masses
Young to old folks, the upper, lower, middle classes
They don't begin wit no lying professor
They begin when Vin pick up the pen and pad up off the dresser
Lesser, a man should never challenge a clan
Wit thirteen years experience of rippin' mic's put in our hands
Detroit niggas are the craziest, Miami niggas are the craziest
Little Rock niggas are the craziest, Oak Town niggas are the craziest
I got barbarians to board me in at a club that barred me when
A broad got thrown like barbarnigan born again, thrown aboard
A brim is broke to the back I brawl and band from brains ta balls
Da boots word ta-burr-bam-boo break the loot
Blowing up brain cells boom like Beirut
Assume the same suit, fuck that fly shit wit the flavor ca shi
Gives last name ain't Suzuki but still my sidekick
Whip that hide quick if ya slide quick, blood clot ya Blood clique
You ain't rollin' if our tape ain't what ya ride wit
Niggas snipe shit so I'm on a knife tip
Like the youngsters 'bout ta take you on some hip-hop ride shit
If you ain't jumpin' then don't pump it
I'm hittin' Jermaine in Atlanta 'cos he owe me loot for that jump shit
Fuck astronauts I rock it
And from now on if you bite my style when I see you, I'm in your pockets
Cleveland niggas are the craziest, Carolina niggas are the craziest
Virginia niggas are the craziest, Kentucky niggas are the craziest
St. Louis niggas are the craziest, Atlanta niggas are the craziest
Maryland niggas are the craziest, San Diego niggas are the craziest
Seattle niggas are the craziest, Boston niggas are the craziest
Ill town niggas are the craziest, Zoo Crew niggas are the craziest
Jersey City niggas are the craziest
All my Newark niggas are the craziest
