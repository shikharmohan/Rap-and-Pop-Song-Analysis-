Feel me and caress me
Hold on tight and don't let go
Baby I'm about to explode
'cause all my love you can control
[case]
I'll spend the night with you
If you promise you will do
All the things to make me scream
And you know just what I mean
'cause tonight you taste like ice cream
I wanna make you fall in love
Make you touch the stars above
Please me low and be my friend
I'll come back and hit it again
And again, and again, and again
Don't go away
Repeat 1

Let me get that lex nigga
Sex wetter than aquariums
Flashing, they get their ass in
Who fucks slow with lear jets and coups
My ones stackin'
You ain't know that I be mackin'
The extra set of keys
The thirty g's
Them chips, the bellies, had you livin' on your knees
Not to mention the laced out crib in dallas
The fourty room palace
Sippin' cristal-ise
Repeat 1 until fade
