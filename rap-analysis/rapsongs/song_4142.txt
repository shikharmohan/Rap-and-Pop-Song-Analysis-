My leather so soft, my top so soft
I'll probably have it off, these niggaz so soft
And I go so hard, bitch I go so hard
She said my leather so soft, my top so soft
I'll probably have it off, these niggaz so soft
And I go so hard, bitch I go so hard, yeah
I get money hoe, fuck what you talkin' 'bout
Straight out the slaughterhouse, straight out the dragon's mouth
Fire you can't put out, tires are standin' out
The coupe look pigeon toed, I be in a different mode
I be with them different hoes, no I mean them different hoes
I mean them Weezy bumbaclot different hoes
And as far as terrific goes
They kiss that dick with no mistletoes
Diamonds and pearls and pussy holes, snortin' coke 'til they nose bleed
I'm sittin' high on them inches I'm in the nosebleeds
I'm on a paper chase until my toes bleed
Then I get on these beats and let my soul bleed
I put 'em in ya head and watch the holes bleed
My rag always red like when them hoes bleed
Now that's cold bleed, no I mean cold blooded
And I'm so southern that's why my leather so soft
My leather so soft, my top so soft
I'll probably have it off, these niggaz so soft
And I go so hard, bitch I go so hard
She said my leather so soft, my top so soft
I'll probably have it off, these niggaz so soft
And I go so hard, bitch I go so hard, yeah
She soft as a bush nigga, she purple like kush nigga
We high on that money nigga, we get it from cook nigga
Hit her with that crook nigga, fuckin' with crooks nigga
Know we 'bout that money and we stackin' like books nigga
Know what I do nigga, them teardrops is true nigga
We stay so fly, ride Bentley coupes nigga
Rolls Royce, garnishes and asses by the beaches
Blowin' on that puff and we drivin' foreign features
Higher than whoever nigga, know we 'bout that cheddar nigga
Know I got a tommy gun, gave one to my younger son
And we got it together
Forty-seven fifty-one you gon' hear us when we come daddy
My leather so soft, my top so soft
I'll probably have it off, these niggaz so soft
And I go so hard, bitch I go so hard
She said my leather so soft, my top so soft
I'll probably have it off, these niggaz so soft
And I go so hard, bitch I go so hard
You see the paper gon' come if not I'm gon' get it
I gotta die with money 'cause I wasn't born with it
It was 9/27/82, baby dude
Charity Hospital, a.k.a the City Zoo
No pity due to no one, nobody, not all man
They dropped us in the game and everybody's tryna ball
And the small hand'll touch ya, the large hand'll cut ya
But until that day I'll be a motherfuckin' stunna, nigga
Ball 'til I fall I done did it for my dawgs
Ball 'til I fall I done did it for y'all
Ball 'til I fall I done did it for me nigga
Ball 'til I fall that's the way it's gon' be nigga
Up in the early I done did it for sunshine
Candy on the paint every time I touch mine
Nine stay cocked 'cause I'm good with firin' mines
Alligator with the suede ridin' them 25's
My leather so soft, my top so soft
I'll probably have it off, these niggaz so soft
And I go so hard, bitch I go so hard
She said my leather so soft, my top so soft
I'll probably have it off, these niggaz so soft
And I go so hard, bitch I go so hard, yeah
