Yo...I think it's really time we let these niggas what's going on with Bone Thugs man (thugs man)...
-Felecia & Krayzie Bone- Intro:
(Yeeeaah!) 'Cause they don't know, they don't know, they don't know (What we been goin' through)/ They don't know, they don't know, they don't know (just where we headin' to)/ They don't know, they don't know, they don't know (come follow me now!)
-Krayzie Bone-
They all wanna know if Bone Thugs are the same/ 'cause one of us left, but four of us remain in this thang/ And we like "just pick up the album man" and I bet they refrain, from all of their claims/ you know that we still the shit...hey, hey/ Light it up (light it up) I feel good (I feel good), nigga from my vibe I feel good all over/ Been through rough times and they been mighty hard (mighty hard)/ (ridin' in the dark) to look for the light and find my spot, I climbed so far/ Them haters was tryna bring me on down (bring me on down), but really nobody can stop us with everything we know now/ we sucker free, we see underneath all you fake thugs/ From all these wack rappers we've come back to save ya/ Man all you back stabbers never ever fade us/ Man I'm so glad we back in action...nigga say what?!?
-Felecia & Krayzie Bone- Chorus:
So good, so right (It feel really, really good to get this money man)/ To be with you tonight...
-Layzie Bone-
Who would've imagined so many problems? even the karma/ I must admit, if it's so many crazy shit then it's still on my mind (of love?), furthermore/ Shit hurt, Bone Brothers; did it with Bizzy,/suppose to be a new beginning but I'm screamin' out "Where is he?!"/ Yes I miss him (how could I not?) when I know Bone is all he got/ One day we might get it together...fulfill the whole plot/ I aint gotta mention how I feel about that other thug, Flesh Bone here you go..some lock-down-love/ You know what really make me feel good?/ Krayzie Bone, Wish Bone really keep it all hood/ That's right...we still pursuing our dream, it aint no 'I' in our team, that's why we doin' our thang/ We getting money, money...money, money..
-Chorus-
-Wish Bone-
They used to look and see a thug, now they look and see a paid thug/ First niggas find and make this paper through the neighborhood/ Yes we blessed, we know this/ so I drop to my knees and let him know who we rollin with/ Everynight..make money, watch paper...grind now, fuck later/ If you miss it gotta battle back/ get that, money money, need that, gimmie some i'll take that/ Since a youngster knew about them green backs/ 'Cause it ain't 4 in the money, fuck what they sayin' chase money/ Do without it, live without it...I cant do that/ Live life, I like..I need every penny/ And these times, this life, better give it to me, to me...
-Chorus-
