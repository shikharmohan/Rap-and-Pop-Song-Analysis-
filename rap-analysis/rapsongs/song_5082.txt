I think I need a sound check
Hit me with a sound check
Yea, now what about that dope stuff

[Missy]
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh 
Yo, 1-2

Ficky ficky, oh you donÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ° know
[MC Lyte - Verse One]
On the regular they guessin?how the Lyte get down
Nevermind that, nigga you better watch your mouth
Keep snoopin?and you bound to hit a brick
Get out the crack of my ass all up in my shiznit
To you nosey NikkiÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ¯ and you Peepin?TomÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ¯
So, you know IÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ¦ about to drop the Brooklyn Bomb
7 and 7 is 14 , 1 and 4 is 5
But none of that matters if your ass ainÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ° alive
You could care less about the records I se;;
You just wanna know I tried but I fell
But even on your best day and on my worst
IÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ£l still be first, without the need to rehearse
[Missy Elliott singing - CHORUS]
Why you up in my business?
Find somethin?better to do
Why you talkin?about me?
I ainÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ° say shit ÃÂ¦Ã¢Â¦'out you
Forgive me for my attitude 
But I got something to say
Yall better not fuck with me 
'cause IÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ¦ had a bad day
[MC Lyte - Verse Two]
Yall must really think IÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ¦ the host of the freakshow
Got me taggin?piranhas I donÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ° even know
Got me swimmin?in waters, gettin?caught in fishnet
Got me hooked up wit?folks I ainÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ° never even met
Now yall so busy tryin?to market this
I guess yo stupid ass forgot who started this
But IÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ¦ about to ransack you make your memory
Come back to you, let all my true niggas jack you
Talkin?bou the Lyte like you gettin?paid for it
Better wish for your own and get out my business
Besides IÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ¦ too quick and pigeons oughta know
By the time you get the info, it was two years ago
Aside from that IÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ¦ too swift to catch
DonÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ° pay to chase the joint, you canÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ° light the match
And everybody knows IÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ¦ too quick to flip the latch
It ainÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ° many that can even say they been attached
[Repeat CHORUS]
