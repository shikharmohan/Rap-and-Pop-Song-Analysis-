G-g-get
Down, to the rhythm that'll rock the walls
Go sportin' and jordans and I'm on the balls
Don't lackin' I'm black but I'm not ? Lou wrong?
Disappeared for a year now I'm back y'all
So get down with the entrepreneur of funk
Not a sloppy fat punk or a Shaolin monk
Ain't down with Johnny cousin know as use at a jam
So to hell with Anne McMahon and Tom McCan
J Ski in the box, farmers is the street
Signing hungry over beasts that's why I always eat
Up to you to guess whose rockin' the funky sound
If you don't know never mind come on and get down
Go LL, go LL, go LL, go LL
Get down
Go LL, go LL, go LL
Get down
Hard like haystacks cow hold
Callin' me a sucker boy you're pushin' a broom
If you try to pull a ace you'll get a punch in the face
All eyes are on my posse when we walk in the place
Got a [Incomprehensible] family from my happy days
Not the boys that play the bench for the Oakland a
He drop you to a hop to the record he play
Couldn't keep it a secret I'm LL Cool J
Rhymes are all wack and real all real
Yo earl, tell the party people the deal
Yo listen here
Ya ain't no thing, can't complain
They catch like a muh'fuck pass to J
That's right, I'm back he's talks how to rap
He used to smurf, now you're jackin' 'cause my name's on the map
Sit and lie, my homeboy earl says, is that he loves hats
With a hands like a hatcher, cut creators in bat
Cut creator on the fader the teachers pet
Baddest man with ten fingers you've ever met
And sooner or later we'll have to sit
Cut creator, cut the record so they don't forget
Get down
Go LL, go LL, go LL
Get down
Go LL, go LL, go LL
I make hard rock jams for hard rock fans
What I'm sayin' is for real this ain't lala land
Got a can full of jams, pullin' off the lid
Competition in New York can do what I did
Cold sender of a story I paid my dues
I rocked at house parties, I was down with crews
Now I'll never be caught, I'm on my P's and Q's
And for the rest of your life you wanna be in my shoes
I scar like stones hard like cement
And I rocked every jam that I ever went
'Cause I got a better rippin' than any emcee has
And I'm down like a brother from Alcatraz
Get down
Go LL, go LL, go LL
Get down
Go LL, go LL, go LL
Ni-ni-nigga-nigga-ni-ni-ni-ninja
I rap the boss is back the only man
You should call when the party's packed
From Paris to L.A. they say I'm as sharp as a pin
When it's a cool J party you gotta get in
So I'm makin' big steps like Gladys Knight in the pier
One rhyme you're on my tensils as I leave my lip
Up the block kids are talkin' and spreadin' the news
About the new grandmaster the one you'll choose
'Cause I'm chuckling I wanna stomp the rest
When I kick it couldn't bore it could only impress
I'm not a hula-hoop this isn't a passin' phase
Hard work pays, I'm gettin' straight up A's
Cool J is runnin' things, I want it understood
Executioner I should wear a black hood
And carry an ax 'cause I'm ruff on wax
Speakers speakin'? Phone-wear from durable? Eight-tracks
Get down
[Incomprehensible] get down
