Growin' up in these streets of Brooklyn
I'm out here in the hook when the world is shooken
Thug life's a tough one, my life's a rough one
Don't make me have to reach out and touch one
I'll break your frame up, turn the flame up
I'll bring your name up 'cuz you're a lame duck
The transmission, beat you to submission
You're just another victim here to rock the friction
I want it all and if it's led through you
You better find a place to hide 'cuz I'll tread through you
I'm gonna get mine so you know my name
Bet your ass 'cuz the mood's about to change
So you wanna be a thug superstar and live hard?

Lemme tell ya exactly what'll happen
When I choke the punks out and people start clappin'
Set ya time, men don't faze and feel the rage of a psycho
Destroyer that you just can't take
Down for the count 'cuz I just won't let it
I'm here to break bones, ring the bell and let's get it
All for the strong just like Gladiators
Rip out your spine like the second Terminator
Haters, ain't got no time for your tactics
I see it right through you and your child-like tactics
No advances, no chances
Our persistence, there to beat down
(Beat him down, dog)

Tazz is a miserable, angry thug
One word, one word describes the Tazzmission effectively
Tazz hates everyone, even himself
One word describes, one word describes the Tazzmission effectively
Who can stop the path of rage?
I got no friends, no allies, hell rises quick
No love for none of you 'cuz you despise my trip
Keep your distance, I don't need your assistance
'Cuz I'm built to last and made for resistance
The pit bull terrier, bone crusha
When I lock on ya, you scream like a busta
'Cuz that's the only way we know our kill
When you're a thug you're always taught to show no fear
I'm going head up, dead up
Will anybody in there make sure that
None of these son of a bitches get up
Gonna get mine, so you know my name
Be aware 'cuz the mood's about to change
So you wanna be a thug superstar and live hard?

There is not a man or a beast on the planet Tazz cannot put out
  (Just another victim)
There it is, he has it in, the Tazzmission
He tapped, he tapped, he tapped
  (Just another victim)
Tazz, Tazz says that's all, Tazz says that's all
(Just another victim)
Who hasn't Tazz choked out?
(Just another victim)
The most miserable son of a bitch on the planet
The human suplex machine
Hey, I'm the end of the world on this son of a bitch
Tonight, right now, falls count anywhere in the building
