You know my weapons conventional, blow a hole, then you foldin'
You be the death of you, every dude, last view will be arial
Put the Range on off road, the woods to bury you
Never question my M.O., or the ammo I carry, a state
Crime or federal, task force to battle you
Faggots, know what the lead'll do, put ya vest on daddy
Them slugs will burn like verenial, off top, take care of you
Dirty laundry, we airing you, respect my gangsta is savy
You little raps don't grab me, the truth'll hurt for they addy
They drink the drink and rade the pain, to build some courage to clap me
Give a fuck if it's tellin' you, more the merry, I'm marry to guns
Muthafuckin' polygamist, nigga, they vary
Bein' need of some medical, livin' life as vegetable
Take that, think about it and don't try nothin' fancy
Make a move and I'll level you, like a bomb with atomic forces
Niggaz betta pray and kiss they crosses
Holy water to bless you, them slugs will tear your tissue
And clog the fuck outta a vassel, and got you seein' me crystal
Niggaz sweatin' in they sleep, I got them sleepin' with pistols
I'm the dope, you the fiend, fuckin' right, I'm fiction
Shot a nigga from frontin', I'm on the run now
Nigga try to fuck with my hustle, I'm on the run now
Used to gettin' paper, I'm touchin', I'm on the run now
Life is so good, nigga, push me, I'm on the run now
Shot a nigga from frontin', I'm on the run now
Nigga try to fuck with my hustle, I'm on the run now
Used to gettin' paper, I'm touchin', I'm on the run now
Life is so good, nigga, push me, I'm on the run now
Nigga be duckin' and slidin', 'cuz they know we providin'
All the shots for they night, they on us, we got it
It's on us, you can put ya money back ya pocket
Keep ya chains and ya watches, this is deeper than robbin'
I want your soul muthafucka, see you deep in some shit
Now you catchin' and shifts, and now I'm ready to flip
Without a thought, now we up in the whips
We play our own music, yeah, yo, we all on our dick
Got these bitches nose open, they be breezin' and fiendin'
Got her shootin' at people, mad 'cuz they girl leave them
They can't believe it, now my car change with the seasons
When the spring, summer, fall, the truck drop or the T Rex
I be boatin' and flyin', strapped in when I'm drivin'
Be on the side walkin' off, we truly be wildin'
They got billions behind 'em, still can't fuck with our rhymin'
And these songs overpower, where shit they frontin'
Shot a nigga from frontin', I'm on the run now
Nigga try to fuck with my hustle, I'm on the run now
Used to gettin' paper, I'm touchin', I'm on the run now
Life is so good, nigga, push me, I'm on the run now
Shot a nigga from frontin', I'm on the run now
Nigga try to fuck with my hustle, I'm on the run now
Used to gettin' paper, I'm touchin', I'm on the run now
Life is so good, nigga, push me, I'm on the run now
Fucked up now, ain't no sense in pttin' the gun down
