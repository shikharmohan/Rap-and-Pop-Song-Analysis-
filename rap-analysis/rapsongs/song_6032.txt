Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah
You make me laugh
'Cos your eyes they light the night
They look right through me, la, la, la, la
You bashful boy
You're hiding something sweet
Please give it to me, yeah
Oh, talk to me some more
You don't have to go
You're the poetry man
You make things alright, yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah
You are the genie
All I ask for is your smile
Each time I rub the lamp, la, la, la, la
When I'm with you
I have a giggling teenage crush
Then I'm a sultry vamp, yeah, a sultry vamp
Woah, talk to me some more
You don't have to go
You're the poetry man
You make things alright, yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah
Woah, talk to me some more
You don't have to go
You're the poetry man
You make things alright
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah, ooh
So once again
It's time to say so long
And so recall the call of life, la, la, la, la
You're goin' home now
Home's that place somewhere you go each day
To see your wife, to see your wife
Woah, talk to me some more
You don't have to go
You're the poetry man
You make things alright, yeah
Woah, talk to me some more
You don't have to go
You're the poetry man
You make things alright
