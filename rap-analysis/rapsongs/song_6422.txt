Too many niggaz takin' rap for a joke
You be up for one minute and then the next you're flat broke
Rhyme about fly bitches Dayton a Hardheaded Spokes
Pockets once was pat but now your bummin' smokes
And now your gun ho got 'cha niggaz by your side
And the topic of your every conversation's let's ride
But let's take 5 and then put that shit aside
But you know as well as I know that you don't wanna die
I give ah fuck about your crew what they wanna do
Them niggaz quick tah cock they straps we cock straps too
And we blast on fools fuck you over
We smoke niggaz too like Black Rob do
We straight criminals fuck an interview
J-Prince will ethnic cleanse like Hitler used to do
Bring on an interlude I'm comin' from a school
Where if ah nigga mouth get out we aim tah hit at you
Method subliminal I'm The Original
That bullshit I heard on your disc was pitiful
I'm critical-nigga I ride around and housin'
My records doin' millions you barely clock a hundred Thousand
I clock more dough plus do more shows
You brag on tight flows but you can't go gold
You sold your soul and bullshit sound low
Fuckin' wit' me is not so need nine mo'
Now the Internet, radio, prison even the TV
All askin' me tah spit the meaning of B U N B
Well, let's see I'm broader than Broadway, rollin' Brahma's on Broadway
Got your bawd out on Broadway tah Broadway in ah broad day
Now I brought the underground plunger sound from down under
Somethin' like when that thunder pound way from round yonder
Hey I'm from the South mane plus I'm the south main
Fanatical film broker than Carol on South Main close your mouth mane
I ain't ask tah see your tonsil's or your tongue
Lookin' sprung like The Prince was for Rapunzel
I gets twisted like a pretzel these rappers cryin' the blues
'Cuz I make this shit look crazier than tyin' my shoes
People ask me do I write rhymes, I tell 'em I used to
Shit now I'm writin' history you gonna remember

Uh, tell ya Lil' J is down with us

You know the boy Brad is down with us

Come in die candy sippin' the Tusk
Niggaz in the south side down with us
Fifth Ward down tah ride down with us
Nore and Ross breakin' 'em off
'Cuz when they think they winnin' fucked boy your lost
I like the rye white raised on gravy and rice
This rap a lot mafia life super tight
Skip Daddy ain't said must of started smokin' rocks
We got game on loud bitch you ain't proud
Smoke private stock-got blades chopped
Keep ah young yell bop and ah pistol tah pop
On ah punk motherfucker talkin' shit wit ah gun
Pimp and Bun like DMC and DJ Run
Everyday I come down them niggaz callin' my game
Then ge on B E T and they don't mention my name
Some grip it on that other level face be bustin' they head
Ride Bentley early 90's watchin' out for the Feds
Red the king of south and I'm the airer to the throne
