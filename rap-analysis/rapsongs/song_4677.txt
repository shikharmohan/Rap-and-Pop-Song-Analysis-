Confused
Ever since I spied you
In the rooms of my mind
Now I can't deny you
Bleeding and bruised
Like a vagabond in rags
I've walked the streets to your door
To find just what's in store
I see you
You and many others
In your clean well-lighted place
Where I would find disgrace
But I do
Know I'd find contentment
Just to be your furniture
I need nothing more
In the thick of the night
Take me out of the cold
Let me sing inside
Like a radio
In the thick of the night
Before we grow too old
Let me sing inside
Like a radio
Shivering and cold
This night's condusive
To a flight into my soul
But I stand here
Though my heart grows bold
Once on the inside
I can quietly persist
And hold my tears
In the thick of the night
Take me out of the cold
Let me sing inside
Like a radio
In the thick of the night
Before we grow too old
Let me sing inside
Like a radio
Like a radio
Like a radio
And so still I wait
Though I grow much weaker
No, no, no, I will not faint
I'll stay true
Believe me when I say
I'd climb to heaven,
Crawl beneath the lowest hell
To stay near you
In the thick of the night
Take me out of the cold
Let me sing inside
Like a radio
In the thick of the night
Before we grow too old
Let me sing inside
Like a radio
Like a radio
Like a radio
Like a radio
Like a radio
