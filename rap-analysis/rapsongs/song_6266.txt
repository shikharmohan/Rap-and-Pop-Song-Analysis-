Fuck that, nigga, look at her toes, you know you like toes, nigga
Bitches be talkin' too much out here, goddamn, mami, you the one
Nigga, that's that bitch right there, always poppin' off at the mouth
Turn it up some, turn my voice up some, where the fuck you at?
Funk Doctor Spock, where she at, yo?
There she go, there she go, yo, nigga, there she go
Nigga, there she go, nigga, here we go
Yo, dat bitch, the one that'll shut her mouth
Don't give a fuck if not my album out
Dat bitch, that'll hustle too
Pull out the baby 380 ask, "Who the fuck are you?"
Dat bitch, that'll go out like, 'Army men'
Dat bitch, wrappin' her hair in Barbie pins
When the pressure's on, you'll find a bomb in your car
In your trunk on the road to Arlington
Yo, dat bitch, the one that'll take control
Brought me a 2 way when my pager broke
Dat bitch, that'll love to fuck, take it in the butt
When the Doc comes, she won't wipe it up
Dat bitch, that'll whip a car better than me
Yo, dat bitch, splittin' cigars better than me
Dat bitch, tattoos on her back an' arm
An' you see my name when the track is on
Dat bitch, that'll jump out dolo
With her toes in a pump with a shotgun pumped out
Dat bitch, that'll roll proper, two phones
One for tricks an' one for callin' the Doctor
Dat bitch, that'll give me brain when I'm thinkin'
Dat bitch, that's makin' me more insane than a ink pen
Dat bitch, that ain't scared to whoop her kids
Know to bail Doc out when my ass in the precinct
Dat bitch, the one that'll shut her mouth
That'll keep it on the low, what I'm all about
Dat bitch, when I'm on the run, she give me a gun
Hide me out at her father's house
Dat bitch, that'll give me brain when I'm thinkin'
Dat bitch, that's makin' me more insane than a ink pen
Dat bitch, Doc need a real bitch for this gorilla
Rilla, rilla, rilla
Dat bitch, the one that'll shut her mouth
That'll keep it on the low, what I'm all about
Dat bitch, when I'm on the run, she give me a gun
Hide me out at her momma's house
Dat bitch, that'll give me brain when I'm thinkin'
Dat bitch, that's makin' me more insane than a ink pen
Dat bitch, Doc need a real bitch for this gorilla
Rilla, rilla, rilla

Won't fuck a nigga until it's payday
Make him think I'm in love, baby
Fuck witcha nigga, makin' motherfuckers hate me
Dat bitch, I'm in the classified
Dat bitch, make a nigga go an' buy me a ride
Do you know who, I be?
I'm the M I crooked, letter Y, nigga
Bad to the Bizzy Bone
Quick bitch, talk shit, night long
I run shit, done, done shit
Pop a gun shit, slap a bum, bitch
Dat bitch, yo, you heard it first from me
Dat bitch, ain't nuttin' but the same O.G.
Dat bitch, I'm rollin' an' strokin'
An' jokin' an' workin'
I'm dat bitch, the one that'll shut her mouth
That'll keep it on the low, what I'm all about
Dat bitch, when I'm on the run, she give me a gun
Hide me out at her father's house

She's the one, she's the one, only one
Hey, lives her life, pays the price
When she keeps it gangsta
