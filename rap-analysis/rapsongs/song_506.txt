Krayzie Bone:
I'm on the highway and its friday in my big truck tryin to get home to you
Stop n get a bottle to pop
I'm lovin the night time when we do what we do
Best part of my day is when we rollin' it up 
And we blowin' and we zonin'
Feelin' the buzz, plus the love
Up Till early in the mornin
Come come, that's right(Thats Right)
Let's go have some fun, in-the-bed-room
All day (All day) and all of the night 
I been workin'
Now daddy comin' home 
And I'm lookin' for a little bit of action
I be comin' through wanna do that thang
Let me bless you with thug passion
Avant:
Girl when we, make, love all night
I mean we, make good love all night
When we, make, love all night
We really make love x2
Wish:
On the way to my hunnies
Leavin' tha club and I'm off that henney baby
Hope a nigga understand that a nigga got a plan
And I really gotta see this lady
Charter plane in Cleveland
Hit up my thugs,let em' know I'm leavin'
Four hours,windows tinted 
Cause you know,how these hoes be creepin'
We off, and it's gonna get freaky 
This weekend, off in my house
And I'm ready 
Just hold it steady,I bet ya I break you off
Yes miss lady 
and you know a nigga need the thugs
so it might get rough I'm sorry
But dont know,you do what you do 
When you drop that dress with that body
My God!!!
Avant:
Girl when we, make, love all night
I mean we, make good love all night
When we, make, love all night
We really make love x2
Layzie:
Baby we did our thang off in the shower
Had me goin'a whole hour
Thought I was scared like I was a coward
When you hit the streets and you felt this power
Of the thang I swang, thangs won't change
And I need that lovin'
Baby that baby u got in the oven
All I need is kissin' and huggin'
All of the drama you can keep it
Ain't no secret, it's revealed
Walk-The-Walk 
Girl gon' and shake that sex appeal
Im still here 
Always gon' be here, never gon' leave
Wanna get down with Steve?
And you my boo, ooh
Bizzy:
Cum at the same time
With you, hit you, with you, with you, with you
Thick up inside you, gristle (ooh)
That's eight and half to nine in ya
Gushy like Niagara
Feelin' my spit ends
Amazed cause I'm in between your thighs lickin'
And other people they be bitin'
And I rap fast, so what cha think I'm finna do with That
One hundred and fifty five 
Seventy one thousand got you paralyzed
Cummin' though shes flabbergasted
I'm Duracell, and others they just don't last
Hittin' the vehicle with homeboy A-vant
Lets mash, Cleveland call back
Avant & Bizzy:
It's the house, in the boat, in the jeep babe
In the tub, in the pool, or the beach babe
Get your groove on (gotta get cha groove on) get your groove on
Bizzy Bone:
