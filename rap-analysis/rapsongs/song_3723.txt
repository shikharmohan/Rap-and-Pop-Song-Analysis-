This is it, New York City
It's very rare you get to hear it like this
We bringin' it back to y'all golden age
Watch this, here we go
The teacha's back, the heat is back
The teacha's back
The teacha's back, the heat is back
The teacha's back
The teacha's back, the heat is back
The teacha's back
The teacha's back, the heat is back
The teacha's back, the teacha's back
The teacha's back, the heat is back
The teacha's back, the heat is back
The teacha's back, the heat is back
Had to chill for a minute so you could see what was whack
Rappers enter the game to increase they stack
No skill, no style, man, please step back
This that real, real, raw, raw, rah, rah, rappin'
We started off street, now you pop, what's happenin'?
You callin' me contradictory
Yet I'm the most consistent MC in rap's history
Is that the mic? Give it to me, hip hop, it's livin' in me
I smack rappers in they mouth deliberately
KRS-One, I really MC
I'm the difference between real and Music TV
We ain't done, uh huh
We ain't done, let's go
Here we go, here we go
Y'all been waitin' for this
Here we go
I spit them conscious lyrics for those that can hear it
I'd rather rhyme about the mind and the body and spirit
But them cats be too hardheaded, they like, "Aww, forget it"
'Til they locked up and they blood is sheddin'
I really spit conscious rap
And when I say stop the violence
How you think we stoppin' that?
With a flower, a protest, a rally, a band
Oh no, I got the baseball bat in my hand
Overstand, I'm takin' a stand, not takin' 'The' stand
I don't disrespect women 'cause I'm a man
And some say fe-man
You uninformed journalists, y'all can talk to the hand
On my block, women get respect and trust
'Cause when you diss a woman you dissin' her fetus
And dissin' our unborn children will defeat us
I'm not an elitist, I just know the world need us
And the whole world don't need y'all
Y'all just beatmakers
You need to learn from Marley Marl
The teacha's back, the heat is back
The teacha's back
The teacha's back, the heat is back
The teacha's back
The teacha's back, the heat is back
The teacha's back
The teacha's back, the heat is back
The teacha's back
