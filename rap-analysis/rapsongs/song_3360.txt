I am a nightmare walking, psychopath talking
King of my jungle, just a gangster stalking
Living life like a firecracker, quick is my fuse
Then dead as a death pack, the colors I choose
Red or blue 'cuss or blood
It just don't matter
Sucker die for your life when my shotgun scatters
We gangs of L.A. will never die, just multiply
Colors
You don't know me, fool, you disown me, cool
I don't need your assistance, social persistence
Any problem I got I just put my fist in
My life is violent, but violent is life
Peace is a dream, reality is a knife
My colors my honor my colors my all
With my colors upon me one soldier stands tall
Tell me what have you left me
What have I got
Last night in cold blood my young brother got shot
My homeboy got jacked, my mother's on crack
My sister can't work 'cause her arms show tax
Madness insanity, live in profanity
Then some punk claiming' they understanding' me
Give me a break, what world do you live in
Death is my sect, guess my religion
Colors
My pants are sagging' braided hair
Suckers stare but I don't care
My game ain't knowledge, my game's fear
I've no remorse so squares beware
But my true mission is just revenge
You ain't in my sect, you ain't my friend
Wear the wrong color, your life could end
Homicide's my favorite venue
Colors
So I'll just walk like a giant, police defiant
You'll say to stop but I'll say that I can't
My gangs my family, it's all that I have
I'm a star on the wall's my autograph
You don't like it, so you know where you can go
'Cause the streets are my stage and terror's my show
Psycho-analyze try and diagnose me, why?
It wasn't your brother that brutally died
But it was mine, so let me define my territory don't cross the line
Don't try to act crazy 'cause the shit don't faze me
If you ran like a punk, it wouldn't amaze me
'Cause my colors death, though we all want peace
But our war won't end till all wars cease
Colors
