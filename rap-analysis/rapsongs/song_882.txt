Harmonizing 'Back on my bullshit'
For 46 seconds
Hey ya'll niggaz thought I wasn't nice
With the second tune and shit
He he he he he oh shit
Ayo Dj Scratch
Th, this how you want me to set it homie
I hope you ready to march niggaz

I hope somebody quickly call up a doctor
Go get a medic 'cause somebody

Oh shit nigga goin' insane, muthafucka

'Til I'm high killa, ignite another flame
Ah, sorry I dig his talent
Well, tie ya little lame look
Okay, it don't matter
'Cause I'm the one to blame

Facin' every challange shit
Incredible hope, lyrical amalgam bitch
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh

Ring everything like El DeBarge
