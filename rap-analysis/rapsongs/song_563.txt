They don't wanna see me shine
Don't wanna see me shine
Don't wanna see me fly
Don't wanna see me ride
They don't wanna see me shine
Don't wanna see me shine
Don't wanna see me fly
Don't wanna see me ride
Why they gotta hate? Steady hatin' mine
Smilin' in my face, fakin' on the side
They don't wanna see me shine
('Cause they don't wanna, they don't wanna
They don't wanna see me shine)
Why they gotta hate? Steady hatin' mine
Smilin' in my face, fakin' on the side
They don't wanna see me shine
('Cause they don't wanna, they don't wanna
They don't wanna see me shine)
As long as I'm alive, no hater gon' never stop my drive
I get it and make it multiply, anything else is suicide
Enemy of the world, that's I energy of an eagle eye
See no evil and I hear no lie, niggas don't wanna see me fly
Higher than a rocket ship, life is not rocket science
Every day is documented, all of my time is occupied
I'm gon' grind and I'm gon' shine, ballin' 'til the end of time
Hate on me and it's all fine, you just ain't no friend of mine
I'm tryin' to focus on bigger and better things
With so many odds against me, I had to step up my game
Imagine problems with crooked coppers
Why they wanna go there? Tried to pop me, lock me
But couldn't knock me off my square
I'm not surprised, you haters wanted to see
Flesh stretched out without my thugs, one steady stressin' out
But we doin' our own thing, the Bone thing
You suckas fail every time tryin' to stop my shine
Why they gotta hate? Steady hatin' mine
Smilin' in my face, fakin' on the side
They don't wanna see me shine
('Cause they don't wanna, they don't wanna
They don't wanna see me shine)
Why they gotta hate? Steady hatin' mine
Smilin' in my face, fakin' on the side
They don't wanna see me shine
('Cause they don't wanna, they don't wanna
They don't wanna see me shine)
Stay away, fade away, playa hater
Stay away, fade away, playa hater
I need you to stay away, fade away, playa hater
Stay away, fade away, playa hater
Twenty four seven grindin', tryin' to get my shine on
That don't give 'em a reason to hate me, hate me, hate me
But I know my mind's strong, none of you suckas can break me
Ha, nothin' can save ya now, they caught the Krayzie vapors
Stay away, fade away, playa hater
There's really no need to be crowdin' me
'Cause I can't deal with you haters surroundin' me, houndin' me
Tryin' to get my paper, hard to keep my faith up
It's time for me to raise up and do this sucker shake up
True T-H-U-G's and we come to kill you, kill you, kill you
I think they might be scared to let me shine
'Cause I'm a righteous playa, I'm a righteous playa
Why they gotta hate? Steady hatin' mine
Smilin' in my face, fakin' on the side
They don't wanna see me shine
('Cause they don't wanna, they don't wanna
They don't wanna see me shine)
Why they gotta hate? Steady hatin' mine
Smilin' in my face, fakin' on the side
They don't wanna see me shine
('Cause they don't wanna, they don't wanna
They don't wanna see me shine)
See me, stack your paper, they hate my grind
Catch me, push that's why I got my swagga down
But never slip in, the clip in, I know they want my life
Any weakness, not here, they know that Wish gon' ride
Hit the streets with that better love
Watch out if you kiss and tell, you know not to show 'em love
It's just that they talk too much, they never know who to trust
And just when you get enough, a target you will become
That's just the hater way
It's the devil's perpetuation, tryin' to make my innocence
It's my retaliation, I don't need no ignorance
I'm standing against this army with Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, Harmony
Danger is just a part of me, like it's stuck in my arteries
These poor playa haters are the motivators but I get my paper, paper
Same rappers that hate us call for verses so we can take from them
Critics, we can't escape for them, don't you think too much Hennessy
Ain't no time for to be slippin', we the world's worst enemy
  (I just got to know)
Why they gotta hate? Steady hatin' mine
Smilin' in my face, fakin' on the side
They don't wanna see me shine
(They don't wanna see me shine, they don't wanna see me shine)
Why they gotta hate? Steady hatin' mine
  (I just gotta know)
Smilin' in my face, fakin' on the side
They don't wanna see me shine
(They don't wanna see me shine, they don't wanna see me shine)
So many people said we wouldn't take it
So many people said we couldn't make it
So I made it up in my mind
  (So I made up in my mind I'll take it)
So I made it up in my grind
  (So I made up my mind I'll take it)
I just gotta know, I just need to know
  (While you keep hating, I'ma keep shining)
I just gotta know
  (While you keep hating)
I just gotta know
  (I'ma keep shining)
Why they wanna hate on me?
  (While you keep hating)
Why they wanna steal my shine?
  (I'ma keep shining)
Why they wanna hate on me?
  (While you keep hating)
Why they wanna steal my shine?
  (I'ma keep shining)
I just gotta know
  (While you keep hating)
I just gotta know
  (I'ma keep shining)
I just gotta know
  (While you keep hating)
I just gotta know
  (I'ma keep shining)
See me shine
  (While you keep hating)
See me shine
  (I'ma keep shining)
Oh, see me shine
  (While you keep hating)
Oh, see me shine
  (I'ma keep shining)
Yeah
(I'ma keep shining, I'ma keep shining)
They don't wanna see me shine
(I'ma keep shining, I'ma keep shining)
They don't wanna see me shine
