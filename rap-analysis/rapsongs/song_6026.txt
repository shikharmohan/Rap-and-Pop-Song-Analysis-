If I gave you my love
I'd tell you what I'd do
I'd expect a whole lot of love outta you
You gotta be good to me
I'm gonna be good to you
There's a whole lotta things you and I could do
What about the way love me?
And what about the way you squeeze me
It's simply beautiful, beautiful
It's simply beautiful baby, simply beautiful
The way you love me, it's simply beautiful
I'm gonna be good to you
So many things I could do for you, baby
Our love is simply beautiful, simply beautiful
When you get right down to it
When ya need me I'll be right there
Simply beautiful
When ya need me I'll be right there
Simply beautiful
When ya need me, right there
Simply beautiful
