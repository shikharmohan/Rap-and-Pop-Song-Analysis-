Knew I said I would roll wit'chu
Put my lifestyle on hold for you
All them sweet things that I told to you
This conversation is overdue
(Freeze)
Kid too wild to respect the vow
I just ain't ready to settle down
My name too big in the ghetto now
(Freeze)
Feels like I'm ready when I'm holdin' you
But it's so many honies, what I'm 'posed to do?
Keep sendin' them apology notes to you
(Freeze)
All I need is for you to freeze
This is hard on me, I don't want to leave
But in the meantime, take back your keys and
Freeze, don't change, don't go, don't leave
(Just, freeze)
I know girl it's a lot to ask
Tell me what other choice I have
When you love someone this bad
Freeze, don't change, don't go, don't leave
(Just, freeze)
And girl I hope you understand
Promise I'll be back for you
When I become a better man
Why I gotta do this I ain't sho'
Why I gotta wild out, I don't know
I know how it feels I've been hurt befo'
I know you're disappointed you expected mo'
(Freeze)
I'm losin' a good one, that's fo' sho'
I be tryin to fight but it calls me yo
Please don't change the locks on the do'
(Freeze)
Quit cryin' 'cause it ain't your fault
Blame it on the streets of New York
Young L gotta walk this walk girl
(Freeze)
I know it's rough but I need your support
You said it all last time that we fought
So don't talk baby hold that thought and
Freeze, don't change, don't go, don't leave
(Just, freeze)
I know girl it's a lot to ask
Tell me what other choice I have
When you love someone this bad
Freeze, don't change, don't go, don't leave
(Just, freeze)
And girl I hope you understand
Promise I'll be back for you
When I become a better man
(What would you think if I told you that I)
Knew that I was breakin' your heart
Wanna explain, but where should I start
(What would you think if I told you that I)
Wake up every mornin' with a different girl
'Cause I don't wanna settle down before I see the world
(What would you think if I told you that I)
Know exactly what you need indeed
Hate to follow but I'm scared to leave
Too scared love'll get the best of me
I know deep down God is testin' me
Hopefully someday I'll give you that ring
But until then just do this one thing
Freeze, don't change, don't go, don't leave
(Just, freeze)
I know girl it's a lot to ask
Tell me what other choice I have

Freeze, don't change, don't go, don't leave

When I become a better man
Don't change, don't go, don't leave

(Freeze)
It's not like I forgot about you or somethin'
I just gotta get this out of my system, know what I mean?
If I could just freeze you, you know what I'm sayin'? It's just
I don't know if I'm ready for all that shit, you know what I mean?
I mean I know we gon' be together one day
Matter of fact I promise you, for now I need you to just
(Freeze)
