Yo, betcha never heard of a joint so knockin'
This one reach 'em all, hip-hop to hard rockers
Even they out of their mind, Hatas can't block ya
I'ma take control enjoy this chart topper
Got no time to sit down you just gotta jump up
I need your attention listenin' to me
See I'm up in the zone now where you all belong now
Nigga, need ya with me move your body
Nigga this is it feel this hotness that I spit
On this swiss beat and it gets no sicker than this
You like that nothin' crazier even exists
DJs put it on, watch the crowd flip
I wanna party in the rain
(Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain)
Things will never be the same
(Things won't be the same)
I wanna party in the rain
(Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain)
Things will never be the same
(Things won't be the same)
Hey yo
This thing's so crazy that it hurts your soul
Don't know what to call it, daddy, call it rock n' roll
All this shit soundin' the same had to switch the pitch
Change it up ya' Nawmean gotta stay that, bitch
How you feel when you hear this wasn't prepared, boy
I need the listeners on the dance floor, go ahead boy
You and your faht play this shit loud, run around
Make your neighbors call the police, come on go make it wild
Some of y'all against this shit, really against this shit
This for the niggas who love me go head and get bent
And if you really want people to think, you insane
Open up your door, let it pour, party in the rain
I wanna party in the rain
(Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain)
Things will never be the same
(Things won't be the same)
I wanna party in the rain
(Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain)
Things will never be the same
(Things won't be the same, no)
Yo, be careful this one here is crazy, I don't wanna scare you
Clearly I'm just try to party and let you niggas hear me
Ya' I ain't really never let myself go but I'ma give it now
You can't even really fuck with this girl if you just sittin' down
Is you with me, with all ya bullshittin', I need to know
Messin' with my concentration, with me you gotta go
I know you ready to shout it out, yo this chick incredible
And there's more to come from baby girl, that's if you ready though
I gotta slow down now, I'm losin' my breath
I think, I might go back now, ready, no not yet
Almost there swiss let's hear 'em bring it back one time
Here we go again, we can party until the sunshine
I wanna party in the rain
(Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain)
Things will never be the same
(Things won't be the same)
I wanna party in the rain
(Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain)
Things will never be the same
(Things won't be the same, no)
Yo, we gone do it like this
Somebody, somebody, everybody, everybody
