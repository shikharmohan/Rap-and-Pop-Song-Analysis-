the one that gave me head can suck the nail out a casket,
shotgun on the kitchen table bullet shells in the cabinet, 
f**kin wit me is like steppin on the tail of a dragon,
wet p***y is my cabin more b***hes than a pageant,

spendin time backwards hotter than a cactus,
and we aint in the building we the f***in contractors,

youngmoney down your throat you gotta stay hydrated,
quarterback weezy young Tom Brady,

i load millions and more millions,
money to the ceilings nicca no ceilings ha ha
