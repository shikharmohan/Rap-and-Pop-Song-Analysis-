Three young cats strapped with gats decided to ride out one night
The in-flight drug used to induce, the hindsight was dust
The moonlight was robust but they couldn't see the beauty in it
Their duty in it was to carry out another senseless killin'
Senses and feelings distorted, they boarded their vessel Nessel
Discreet in crotches and underneath seats they tuck heat
To complete the mission they had no decision in
No longer do they use our light and dark used to create
The vision in our towns but now, they red and blue override our brown skin
We've been conditioned to let off them rounds
When we see another color rag or hear another brother brag
About what set he claimin', poverty, drugs and poor
Education should be the target but we won't stay gamin' that
We'll kill and maim another cat like there's no shame
In that like there's fame in that, we hang out them car windows
And bust them slugs in the name of genocide in disguise
So we don't take blame for that but if there's honor amongst
You thieves in life then what the fuck you hidin' for?
Recognize your deed to trife and decide what the fuck you ridin' for
