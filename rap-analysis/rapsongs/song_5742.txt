I don't want to write this down 
I'm gonna tell you how I feel right now 
I don't wanna take no time to write this down 
I'm gonna tell you how I fell right now 
Tommorow may never come 
For you or me life is unpromised 
Tommorow may never show up 
For you or me 'cause life is unpromised 
(Bridge) 
I ain't no perfect man 
I'm tryin to do the best that I can 
With worries that I had 
I ain't no perfect man 
I'm tryin to do the best that I can 
With worries that I had 
I put my heart and soul into this yall 
I hope you feel me 
From where I am 
To where ever you are 
I mean that sincerely 
Tommorow may never come 
For you or me 
Life is unpromised 
Tommorow may never appear 
You better hold this very moment 
Very closely (right now) 
Very closey (right now) 
So close to you 
Sooooo close to you 
Don't be afraid 
Let it shine 
(chorus) 
My Oomy said shine your light on the world 
Shine your light for the world to see 
My Ahmby said shine your light on the world 
Shine your light for the world to see 
(I want black people to be free,to be free,to be free) 
My Ahmby said shine your light on the world 
Shine your light on the world to see 
My Oomy said shine your light on the world 
Shine your light for the world to see 
Sometimes I get discouraged 
Look around and things are so weak 
People are so weak 
Sometimes, sometimes I feel like crying 
Sometimes my heart gets heavy 
Sometimes I just want to leave and fly away 
Sometimes I don't know what to do with myself OW!! 
Passion takes over me 
Feel like my man 
Going in chains, losin my brain, tryin to maintain every thang hey hey hey 
Put my heart and soul into this yall 
Hope you feel me from where I am to where ever you are 
Sometimes I don't want to be bothered 
Sometimes I just want a quiet life with me and my babies, me and my lady 
Sometimes I don't want to give you a sto ball 
(black people to be free) 
Sometimes I don't want to be a soilder 
Sometimes I just want to be a man but 
Chorus 
Oomy said shine your light on the world 
Shine your light for the man to see 
My Ahmby said shine your light on the world 
Shine your world to see 
(I want black people to be free) 
My Genie said shine your light on the world 
Shine your light for the world to see 
My Elders said shine your light on the world 
Shine your light on the world to see 
I want black people to be free, to be, free, to be free 
Want my people to be free, to be free, to be free 
Want black people to be free, to be free, to be free 
All black people to be free, to be free, to be free 
That's all that matters to me 
That's all that matters to me 
That's all that matters to me 
That's all that matters to me 
That's all that matters to me 
That's all that matters to me 
(to be free, to be free, to be free) 
That's all that matters to me
