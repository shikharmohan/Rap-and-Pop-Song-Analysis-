Guess who's bizzack
Still smell the blow on my clothes
Like crispy cream I was cooking them o's
Like horseshoes I was tossin' them o's
Time to re up gotta recycle the flow
I'm emotional, I hug the block, I'm so emotional
I love my glock cash rules everything around me
So what's realer' bout the scriller so call me a ghost face killa
It's kinda hard to be drug free
When Georgia power won't give a nigga lights free
Switched hustles been killin' 'em ever since
Been paid to tell the truth it only make sense
When they play that new jeezy watch the dope boys go crazy
And watch the dope boys go crazy
I pop my collar then I swing my chain
If you catch me in the club pimpin' doing my thang
When they play that new jeezy watch the dope boys go crazy
And watch the dope boys go crazy
They pop my collar then they swing they chain
All the gangstas in the street that be doin' they thang
Won't stop till my whole team in thug mansion
And I sell like Pac that's a thugs passion
And this the realest shit I ever wrote
And all eyes on me like a microscope
Young jeezy give 'em one more chance
They try to shine like you and get your whole advance
Like my main man pulla talk real slick
Look I'm ok but my watch sick
You don't gotta like a [unverified] just respect my mind
This is how I'm eatin' now
So respect my grind
The way I put them words together
Reminds me about how I put them byrds together
When they play that new jeezy watch the dope boys go crazy
And watch the dope boys go crazy
I pop my collar then I swing my chain
If you catch me in the club pimpin' doing my thang
When they play that new jeezy watch the dope boys go crazy
And watch the dope boys go crazy
They pop my collar then they swing they chain
All the gangstas in the street that be doin' they thang
Buy 18 the hard way
Now have a humble nigga thinkin' 'bout gun play
Now who the fuck wanna play with guns
Alotta holes, alotta blood dog
That shit ain't fun so I suggest that you don't play with my chain
Or I'll send these hollow's at you
Let them play with ya brain the streets is watchin'
The name is warn the products white
A star is born pimpin' I'm so fly I take this parachute off
I might fall and die wrap the work with spandex with the latex
Then we ship it outta town call it safe sex
When they play that new jeezy watch the dope boys go crazy
And watch the dope boys go crazy
I pop my collar then I swing my chain
If you catch me in the club pimpin' doing my thang
When they play that new jeezy watch the dope boys go crazy
And watch the dope boys go crazy
They pop my collar then they swing they chain
All the gangstas in the street that be doin' they thang
