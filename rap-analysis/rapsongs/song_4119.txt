Hey
i remember the way
we would both say
we'd be together 
forever and a day
well i guess dat day
came sooner den late
cause now we're apart and away
and it feels so stra-
N-G-E wouldn't you say
i use to call you babe
and you use to obey
and i just wish we could
"do it again" (X3)
hey
i got my business together
wish i could get together
but timing is an error
and i 
tell a lie
to you like never
if i was even ever
given another chance to
"do it again" 
like i've died
and gone to heaven
climbed inside a treasure
died inside of pleasure 
like wow
your smile is but of essence
your child is so precious
i wish it was paternally mine 
but karma is a message
but imma try to test it
and scream for a blessing
so loud
and i hope that he catch it
and one day you come fallin
out of the most highest cloud
then i'll be there to catch you
yes
i'll be there to let you
do the things
we didn't do before now
next time we have to stretch it
do it never forget it
i never forgot
i wish dat we could
"do it again" (X3)
Hey
im just trynna talk to you
if i could talk to you
then i would talk 
forever and a day
yes i remember 
so vividly
how we would be
when we lay
and my then blue skies 
were no longer gray
she so brightened up my day
put it on a scripture
she would be the picture
if perfect had a face
i promise you homie
that you would be hungry like me
if you had a taste
i put it on my mama
cause baby girl is a flower
a flower without a vase
no water needed at all
she continues to grow
more beautiful everyday
and i love her somethin vicious
and i was just wishin 
we could
"do it again"(X3)
