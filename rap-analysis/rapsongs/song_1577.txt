We ain't trying to hear shit for what?
(Cash money)
We whole world operating off a
(Cash money)
To all my niggas with a whole lotta
(Cash money)
Watch yo' back money
You couldn't neva understand how my mind tick
I'm on some old school crime shit
When niggas sold two's to keep the dimes lit
Ain't no rules when these iron shots are stoned, dun
This heat burn through your flesh, straight to the bones
I reach for the buddha, cess and zone
I probably have a future of stress, stay depressed and be alone
But as far as the present time, it's on
I represent mine 'til I return to the S
And said I'm dead and gone
Nobody wanna be broke and you neither
Put me on the co'na, watch me catch a quick case of cream fever
If you be popping shit, my niggas won't believe ya
Probably punch you in the face and take ya wallet when we see ya
But son, it gets deeper
I'm running with a click that's being hunted by the Grim Reaper
To all my peoples in the man keeper
Let'cha situation be a teacher
Ain't nothing like a education
When I was locked down, I learned about patience and dedication
And not to say shit unless you need a motherfucking face lift
And as a youth, I was a outcast
Running around with pelagons, playing war
But now it's all about cash
I'm caught up, caught up in a mix of shit
And I ain't trying to hear shit 'til my got cash to get
Blast you with the pistol
If I have to, in my mind, it's all about cash in a fistful
I'm caught up in a mix of shit
And I ain't trying to hear shit 'til my got cash to get
Splash you with the pistol
If I have to, in my mind, it's all about cash in a fistful
Up late night and upset and fed up
Niggas coming up wet, I'm dead up
Fuck trying to your head up
And when it go down, word bond, we gotta get up
Too many locked down upstate, son, it's a set up
My life has sped up, many years, I'm straight up
Plenty bears for who ain't here and those who ate up
Test and get sprayed up in the club
We couldn't run it, so we take the blade up in the booth
Since we couldn't shoot
We heat it up, losing the shirt, showing the bare chest
I'm blessed, puffing the skunk make me care less
The best that you can do is duck my fucking crew
If the slugs don't get'cha, Lord J'll jig ya
Acting artificial, you'll get burnt my the pistol
Before it's done, even my guns'll turn to missiles
Don't have to blow the whistle on you
'Cuz everybody knows you
Watch yourself around borderline psychos
Who know my people gotta hold a mint
Or they ain't worth a cent
How can you represent if you can't pay the rent?
And leave a dent in my life time, I'm caught up in trife crime
In fights, you neva know what you might find
We stand firm meanwhile 'cuz niggas that seem wild
Be bucking blanks, if they were men they wouldn't fuck with pranks
I leave them niggas alone and stay home
Until it cool down, as they remember how my tool sound
I'm caught up, caught up in a mix of shit
And I ain't trying to hear shit 'til my got cash to get
Blast you with the pistol
If I have to, in my mind, it's all about cash in a fistful
I'm caught up in a mix of shit
And I ain't trying to hear shit 'til my got cash to get
Splash you with the pistol
If I have to, in my mind, it's all about cash in a fistful
We ain't trying to hear shit for what?
(Cash money)
We whole world operating off a
(Cash money)
To all my niggas with a whole lotta
(Cash money)
Watch yo' back money
Yeah, we up on what we dealing with
We ain't no criminals, we got the right to have gats
As long as the army, navy, air force, marines got gats
We gon' hold heat, knamsaying?
'Cuz our army gotta represent for us, word up
Aiyyo, Maintain
(Yeah)
Set that shit, son
Forever keeping my shit cocked for drama
Stainless steal, shit is for real
The way these rats is known to squeal, making sour deals
Thugs up in to mix with these drugs, caught up in the humble
Bricks and paper by the bundle, how the Bronx humble
[Unverified] devils get deaded, never regret it, only known to set it
Stealing existence, obviously ya jetted
Speak the dissest, I see the pyramid and eagle
Back of the dollar bill, ill deceitful, we consider lethal
God falling, niggas be balling, guzzling alcoholics
Two drinks, too many is like whitey infiltrating your fortress
This is on, we 'bout to form, best prepare for the storm
Y'all funny niggas quick to ring the alarm
Bomb fell, now a nation is gel
We had to dwell for four hundred or more
The Lord had the right just living poor
Resurrecting the true and living back the power
Devils getting devoured, niggas heard the God holla
