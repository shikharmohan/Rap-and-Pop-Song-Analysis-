This ain't Sinatra
This ain't the Carter
I am the chaperone nigga who brought'cha
I am the author...this is Holy water
From the Holy Father the Rock of Gibraltar
Step up to the alter step up to the slaughter
Get circumsized son and turned into a daughter
nigga know they oughta drink the fuckin' kool-aid
Industy laid out authorities are too late
MC's passed the due date nigga as they do hate
You are Bobby Boucher I'm the Mane like Gucci
I rock the Louie but not like Kanye
nigga see me kinda like Harry Belafonte
Step into the room they be like ah Day-O!
Yeah cause they know a nigga  ain't play-doe
Shots all fatal is this Laredo
Boarder town i knock'em down just like legos
Drink the Kool-Aid!
verse 2
I ain't the Doctor
This ain't the patient
This ain't that nigga always on vacation
This ain't no white boys rehabilitation
This is crazier then a boat full of Haitians
This is inflation mixed with degradation
This ain't no dead rappers reincarnation
I heard it was a New West Coast I ain't worried
I murder more stars then Conrad Murray
I got more bars then the penitentary
I wrote this shit without a rhyme dictionary
Young bucks try to step up to the harim
Looking for some pussy I'm a old buck I dare'em
Drink the Kool-Aid
