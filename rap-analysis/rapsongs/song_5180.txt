Huh! And if you ever disrespect the Bust or Meth

I came to bring the pain, more hard to the brain
Tical, I'm bustin' that ass again
I burn like acid rain, that acid slang
These niggaz try'nna see how I come ash again
Main and evident, I'm huntin', yes, Meth for president
Be in hell with Dazel and George just for the hell of it
And I ain't yellow kid, flows hot as kettle get
Now if you ain't fuckin' with that, you must be celibate
Spaz! Just a little, got a sack lookin' fizzle
Little hash in the middle, where it at? In the middle, yup
Mommy if you got a fat ass, make it jiggle, yup
Put it in my next video shot by Little X
And M E F gon' work 'til their ain't any left
I'm tryin' get what I'm worth and not a penny less
Think fast

Now watch me back your shit up, I hope your people pull up
And pick up and pack your shit up, homie, it's time to move
While I'm singin', ma, do you let relieve you of all of your
Figure seating sketching, never believe in your niggaz
(Come on!)
Go head and babble you can watch me patiently waiting
Aimin', attackin', instead I'ma let one of my bitches slap you
I ain't watch you when your niggaz'll try
To feel a wrath of the un-rudely waking of a sleeping giant
(Very defiant)
Once I give you the pressure
And then I apply it and then your breathing is stop and totally quiet
Captain of this ship, so call me the pilot
I leave you and your crew to collide with me
Die, stomp on a nigga, just like a herd of a thousand cattle
That'll travel over your face and frazzle your shit
Shot you, worst than a brick and then be torturin' you
And then get the reverend and get to steppin', nigga!
This shit'll make you
Make you rob somebody
(What?)
Grab somebody

Stomp somebody
(What?)

Make you wanna step to the bar and sip Bacardi

(What?)
Me and Meth'll step to you, quick! And smash somethin'
(What?)
Now who is he? Dope M.C. killin these cowards
Wack niggaz get pimp slapped, give me some powder
Click-clack, one in your back, now think about it

You know we seeing it through God
The streets be needing niggaz like me and you, God
Aiyo, I think we're up, seen it from here, we got a mile, yo
