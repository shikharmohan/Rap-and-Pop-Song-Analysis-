Yo come here you oven head
Yo what's the word? Dred upstairs
Passin' all packs escorted from Kinetta ear
Yo the nigga name unknown, Kingston, had it sown
Never rocked the combs, his wig was big
Rob robs on the side, little lucky charm
Dred with jars, flooded graveyard, Brown, Clark's on
Playin' feds in the shark bar, la la, you are boss star
With another dred named Gov, both diamond jimmed out
Rockin' rentals, spittin' phlegm out
Sucked his teeth , two fingers pointin' down
What up Bonna, passin' Marijuana to Tanya
C.E.O of Benny Hanna, he fucked, sent her to Ghana
He's a Benz nigga, rocked shorts, begs times nigga he real
Took us to Switzerland, dressed us all ill
Smoking Ganja, rocked Anacondas
On next border Elantra, sent it to his mama
Now that's a major move, the nigga love family
Wouldn't hand me no drugs, showed me his jammi
Bulldog Stanley, lexin' on kinal, sit down, do it Chinese style
On graduation day he threw me a towel
He came through , heavy like fuck , suit flammable
Ill pair gators. he copped in Beirut
Had his man with him, just stare don't stand with him
If assassination strike, he gotta make plans with him
Roll a joint, keep him on point, down troing poing coin?
Freaked it, members like that I wanna join
The next day I heard he got knocked, fucked me all up
We felt it on the block, let the seeds rock
Peep what the nigga got rocked for
Smugglin' dust in Rushmore, four more he went to war for
Moral of the storo ,conspiracy smacked mortals
I'm outta here showin' love like Zorro
