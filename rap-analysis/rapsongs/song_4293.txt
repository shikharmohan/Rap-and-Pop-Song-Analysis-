[Lil Wayne]
Nice tires on da 'Ghini,
you should wanna king me
Brain dead flow, vegetable, zucchini
I live on the beach,
She walk around in her bikini
Girls are like school,
And cut 'em like seniors
I'm here to distinguish,
The bears from the penguins
Life is Just a gap,
Get some money in between it
Glocks like police,
Pumps like fenas
This beat gettin' totaled,
Pam,Keisha,Kema
Sittin' on da World,
Thinkin' 'bout a girl
Pistol on my side,
Paint you like mural
Dig in my pocket,
Pulled out the party
Be cool before you get stumped and pulled out the party
Ha Ha Hollygrove shit, I'm on my Hollygrove shit
Lookin' for a bad bitch, I give her dinosaur dick
Big bad flow Weezy, fuck the polices
Church like a choir and a couple of old priests
Elevator in my crib 'cause it's five floors
I'm not expectin' you to have one inside yours hahe
Vince Young, suicide doors, haha,
Life's a bitch, now die for her.
[Short Dawg]
I have the type of flow niggas don't have to like,
My rhymes is ambidextrous so I don't have to write,
The way I'm eating niggas wish they had my appetite,
Straight up out of Texas and I'm major like Apple White,
I pull four then I hit the exit door,
Take a trip to Macy's cop the whole second floor,
Hood smell the scent of money coming out my pours,
Yeah my pockets full of dead people like a morgue, bore,
I made it from a flyer to the Forbes, (see me)
Young Elvis Freshly, yes he flyer than the store,
Dropping babys out and your chicks cheek, kicks neat,
Got your son looking up to me like I'm 6 feet,
Your daughter need someone to save her, not me,
I knocking hoes down like Laila Ali,
Try he and Imma put the toaster to ya kidney,
Then I pull off in a Bentley top open like a chimney,
Damn, it's No Ceilings like a colosseum,
Candy slab, paint dripping like goneria
The way I'm leaning I'm annoyed if I stand still,
Flow harder than an anvil,
Short (Short)
[Gudda Gudda]
Ok, it's Gudda hoe,
All about my "bills" like "buffalo",
Your bitch under my sheets,
I heard she was an undercover hoe,
Purple got me moving slow,
Like I'm in a snail race,
Pop pop pop 3 shots to the head,
Then I pick up my shell case,
Leave 'em with a pale face,
Yes, I am a Young Money goon,
Your girl like a motion picture, she be coming soon,
I do a certain rule, I pop her like balloons,
I dance her of to Mills and drop her off the tune,
Couple screws lose, you don't wanna play with him,
This is No Ceilings bitch, roofless like a stadium,
We shut down every fucking spot these bitches see us in,
You want us in your club, well nigga pay us then,
All grey BM, I'm getting from my baby M,
She told me get the money and count it for me when I rake it in,
Don't play no games hoe,
You know my name hoe,
G-U-D-D-A propane flow
