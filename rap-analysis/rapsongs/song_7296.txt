[Intro: T.I.]
Yo, ayyyyyy, huh-ayyyy
I gotta love my man here engineerin (okay)
It don't take me too long to write it (uh, huh-ayyyyy)
How long it take you to record me baby? HEY! (huh-ayyyyy)
Hey ya ain't live, you don't ride, you don't do it like I do it
(It's all good man, we gon' ride on these fuck niggaz anyway though)
Ya ain't real, you don't wanna get into it
Don't play with yourself nigga (okay)
Play a lotto nigga (okay)
Hey - let's get it! (yeahhhhh fuck nigga, AY!)
[Chorus: T.I.]
Hey ya ain't live, you don't ride, you don't do it like I do it
I keep it real - ya ain't real, you don't wanna get into it
Ya ain't crunk, ya ain't buck, ya ain't hard, ya ain't G
You ain't got what I got pumpin in your heart, you ain't me
You do all that yellin, holla, ya ain't real and ya ain't bout it
Ya ain't serious, ya ain't crazy, you know you don't wanna die
Ya ain't hustle from the bottom, you don't got it like I got it
You can hate and you can lie but pussy nigga I'm the hottest
[T.I.]
I'm the realer nigga in this shit, aside from all the business shit
I'm the nigga sucka niggaz best to keep it pimpin with
People say I start a lot of shit, I say I finish it
Thank God it wasn't no witnesses, I'd still be servin sentences
Rap shit way more stressful that I love my other businesses
Thank God I'm a professional and scared I don't begin to get
Whether in a Phantom or the truck with all the kids in it
Still tote a hammer try me, man I hope you listenin
Your death gon' be elaborate, real fuckin extravagant
I'm down to die myself to show you niggaz I ain't havin it
Had to kill your son and a few your momma had to get
And they were playin dumb, we run in and ask where daddy at
[Chorus w/ ad libs]
[Mac Boney]
I carry niggaz on my back like a bookbag
Put the pistol in his hand and tell him shoot his ass
I pull a little file faster than them credit people
Yo' ass dead, that's why you probably seein dead people
The weapon with me's really lethal, yeah it scare people (oh my God)
I know off top that I'm gon' bust, that's why I dare people
And I won't dare cheat you, I fair-and-square beat you
Same time, same time's why I'm on that Grey Goose
Don't make me spray and let loose, cause I won't hesitate to
I heard one shot then heard two, jumped up out the truck like what it do
I got a fo'-five on me and got a nine too
A nigga sayin "Mac Boney, we ain't shoot at you"
I say you sucka ass niggaz better keep it movin
'Fore y'all boys be the ones I end up doin
[Chorus w/ ad libs]
