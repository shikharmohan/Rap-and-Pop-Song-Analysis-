Baby I love you and i'll never let you go
But if I have to boy I think that you should know
All the love we made can never be erased
And I promise you that you will never be replaced (2x)
I love you ,yes i do
I'll be with you as long as you want me to
Until(until) the end(the end) of time
From the day I met you I knew we'd be together
And now I know I wanna be with you forever
I wanna marry you and I wanna have your kids
Thinking never compared to the feeling of your kisses
I can say I'm truly happy to this day
You make think I better live my life everyday
There's never been a doubt in my mind 
That I regret ever having you by my side
But if the day comes that I have to let you go 
I think there's somethin' I should probably let you know
I enjoyed everyday that I spend with you
And I will miss you but I'm happy that I even had you at all
Baby I love you and I'll never let you go
But if I have to boy I think that you should know
All the love we made can never be erased
And I promise you that you will never be replaced (2X)
I love you ohh yes I do
I'll be with you as long as you want me to
Until the end of time
