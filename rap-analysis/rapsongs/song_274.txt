Aww yeah
What I like the brothers and sisters
In the audience to do right about now
Including y'all in the back
I want you to snap your fingers like this, c'mon, c'mon
Aww, c'mon, I know y'all got rhythm, c'mon
Everybody snap your fingers like this
Every single soul, c'mon
Aww, what's goin' on right about here is center stage
It's about a brotha, it's what a brotha does
When he's gettin' ready for a date, ha ha, yeah
My mom likes to call it 'The Gettin''
She calls it 'The getting'' because the brotha's gettin' slick
Gettin' ready, gettin' snazzy
Gettin' prepared for a dinner
And gettin' prepared for an even mo' betta dessert
If you understand what I'm talking about?
I think this sista and brotha know
What I'm talking about, check this out
Gettin' jazzy, gettin' snazzy, alright
But you probably ain't gettin' it on, oh yeah
Brotha man, brotha man
Brotha man thinks he's gonna knock boots tonight
You know what I'm talkin' about?
I think brotha man think he's gonna
Do the nasty tonight, alright? I think brotha man thinks he's gonna
Umm, hit the skins tonight
If you know what I'm talking about, alright
I said, "Yo baby, yo baby, yo baby, yo uh", yeah
Ah, but the sistas ain't down
With that type of stuff no mo', you see
They decided, yo
We ain't gotta have materialism type of stuff
We want somethin' mo' than that
Am I right sistas?
Ah yeah, so you know, um
Brotha man is wearing the most expensive clothes
The most expensive watch
The most expensive Calvin Klein jeans
And all those type of thang
But the sistas don't give a dang
Because a sista's got her own thang goin' on
She wants a real man, you know what I'm talking about, yeah
Well, I tried to tell the brotha
I said, "Brotha man, sistas don't want that type
Of thang in the black community anymore"
We lookin' for somethin' a little bit deeper
Gettin' jazzy, gettin' snazzy
But you probably ain't gettin' it on
Oh, gettin' jazzy, gettin' snazzy
But you probably ain't gettin' it on
And all the brotha had to really do was to be upset
