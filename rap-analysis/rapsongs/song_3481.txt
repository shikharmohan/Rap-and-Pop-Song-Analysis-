Oh, yah, I got the perfect song for the kids to sing
And all my people thats drug dealing
Just to get by stack your money till it gets sky high
We weren't suppose to make it past 25 jokes on you we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
"We don't care what people say"
If this is your first time hearin' this
You are about to experience somethin so cold man we
Never had nothing handed took nothing for granted
Took nothin from no man, man I'm my own man
But as a shorty I looked up to the dope man
Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke man
Flickin' Starter coats man, man you don't know man
We don't care what people say
This is for my niggas outside all winter
'Cuz this summer they ain't finna say next summer I'm finna
Sittin' in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is lil Tre's scholarship
'Cuz ain't no tuition for havin' no ambition
And ain't no loans for sittin' your ass at home
So we forced to sell crack rap and get a job
You gotta do somethin' man your ass is grown
Drug dealin' just to get by stack your money till it gets sky high
Kids sing, kids sing
We weren't suppose to make it past 25, jokes on you we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
"We don't care what people say"
The second verse is for my dawgs working 9 to 5
That still hustle 'cuz a nigga can't shine off 6:55
And everybody sellin' make up, Jacob's and bootleg tapes
Just to get they cake up we put shit on layaway then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money, cop work then push packs
To get paid and we don't care what people say
Momma say she wanna move south
Scratching lottery tickets eyes on a new house
Around the same time Doe ran up in Dude's house couldn't get a job
So since he couldn't get work, he figured he take work the drug
Game bolemic it's hard to get weight
So niggas money is homo it's hard to get straight
But we gonna keep bakin' to the day we get cake
And we don't care what people say, my niggas
Drug dealin' just to get by stack your money till it gets sky high
Kids sing, kids sing
We weren't suppose to make it past 25 but jokes on you we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
"We don't care what people say"
You know the kids gonna act a fool
When you stop the programs for after school and they DCF's
Some of them dyslexic they favorite 50 cent song is 12 questions
We scream rocks blow weed, park see now we smart we ain't retards
The way teachers thought hold up hold fast we make mo cash
Now, tell my momma I belong in that slow class
It's bad enough, we on welfare
You tryin' to put me on the school bus with the space for the wheel chair
I'm tryin' to get the car with the chromy wheels here
You tryin' to cut our lights out like we don't live here
Look at what's handed us, father's abandon us
When we get the hammers go and call the ambulance
Sometimes I feel no one in this world understands us
But we don't care what people say, my niggas
Drug dealin' just to get by stack your money till it gets sky high
Kids sing, kids sing
We weren't suppose to make it past 25 but jokes on you we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
"We don't care what people say"
