Yeah, can you please motherfuckin' rise?
For the national motherfuckin' trapstar anthem
Let's go
'Cause bitch I'm amazin', look what I'm blazin'
Eyes so low, yeah I look like an Asian
Forever clubbin', forever thuggin'
Haters run they mouth, they ain't talkin' 'bout nothin'
'Cause bitch I'm amazin', look what I'm blazin'
Eyes so low yeah, I look like an Asian
Forever clubbin', forever thuggin'
Haters run they mouth, they ain't talkin' 'bout nothin'
'Cause bitch I'm amazin'
Closed door armor, lookin' like it's miller times
Sixty Seven diamond chain, who he think he Busta Rhymes
Bitch, I bust a lot of rhymes, could've done a lot of time
And I ain't never snorted shit, put it all up on the line
Got a lot up on my mind, got a lot up on my plate
Gotta feed my hood, so I'm up and down the interstate
The streets need a nigga so I'm in and out that vocal booth
Hoes love a nigga 'cause I'm in and out they yellow coupe
But nuttin' but banana split, say that I'm her favorite
If you can take a lot of dick I can talk a lot of shit
Go on baby swag it up, show them haters who you're with
Bring your Wu-gang gangsta shit, who you niggas fuckin' with
'Cause bitch I'm amazin', look what I'm blazin'
Eyes so low, yeah I look like an Asian
Forever clubbin', forever thuggin'
Haters run they mouth, they ain't talkin' 'bout nothin'

Eyes so low, yeah I look like an Asian
Forever clubbin', forever thuggin'
Haters run they mouth, they ain't talkin' 'bout nothin'
'Cause bitch I'm amazin'
First I sold two mill' then I sold another one
Told them if you pay for three, that I will front another one
Told them if they give me this, then I'll record another one
But if you cannot give me that ain't no sense in callin' back
Fuck you think they sell me for, fuck you think they find me at
Damn right American, I'm gonna need a bigger hat
Close your eyes imagine this, gonna need a bigger safe
I got bills up in that bitch, that bitch stacked up since '98
Let 'em talk, let 'em hate, watch the Lincoln navigate
If you touch 'em, wipe 'em off, fingerprints they take 'em all
I can make an avalanche and I ain't talkin' Chevy trucks
Call me Georgia lottery 'cause I'll be talkin' mega bucks
'Cause bitch I'm amazin', look what I'm blazin'
Eyes so low, yeah I look like an Asian
Forever clubbin', forever thuggin'
Haters run they mouth, they ain't talkin' 'bout nothin'
'Cause bitch I'm amazin', look what I'm blazin'
Eyes so low, yeah I look like an Asian
Forever clubbin', forever thuggin'
Haters run they mouth, they ain't talkin' 'bout nothin'
'Cause bitch I'm amazin'
Must've spent ten grand to make they coupe stand taller
First 'round draft pick, yeah I'm motherfuckin' baller
Just write your number down, baby girl I might call ya
If she give it to me now she won't live to see tomorrow
And if she playin' with it she won't make it through the night
Before the song with Kanye, I had my money right
Used to call me vice grips, yeah I keep my money tight
Now, it's time to re-up and then I make my money white
You can catch me at my jewel, yeah I like my money bright
You can find me at the lot, yeah I like my money fast
Two hundred on the gas, two hundred on the dash
Yeah, I'm spendin' all money, yeah I'm livin' in the past
'Cause bitch I'm amazin', look what I'm blazin'
Eyes so low, yeah I look like an Asian
Forever clubbin', forever thuggin'
Haters run they mouth, they ain't talkin' 'bout nothin'
'Cause bitch I'm amazin', look what I'm blazin'
Eyes so low, yeah I look like an Asian
Forever clubbin', forever thuggin'
Haters run they mouth, they ain't talkin' 'bout nothin'
'Cause bitch I'm amazin'
