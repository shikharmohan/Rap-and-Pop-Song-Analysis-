Straight off tha streets of muthafuckin' Compton
It's the downest nigga I know
Eazy muthafuckin' me
Bout to kick your ass in ninety-three
I creep and I crawl and I creep and I crawl
And I creep and I crawl creep creep
I said I creep and I crawl and I creep and I crawl
And I creep and I crawl creep creep
I got my niggas from gravestreet watts
I got my niggas from the CPT
I got my niggas all across the motherfuckin' land
Thats down with the Eazy-E
Now, early in the mornin' I awake
Thinkin' about these dead fool's life that I had to take
Frontin' on a true name I peep game at point blank range
Fuck 'em
(Muthafuckin' right y'all )
Back to the set as I jet
Not givin' a fuck about the nigga that I went
Thats what he gotta shout for actin' like a trick
Now he's 6 feet and I'm deep in his bitch
Creepin' creepin' creepin' on the marks that be sleepin'
Catch you slippin' slap the clip in buck 'em every weekend
A scandalous lil' nigga with the heart to feel remorse
Dick the niggas corps leave it on his momma's porch
Don't give a fuck about shit that's why I mellow
Or maybe it's the fact that I'm kin to the devil
A psychopathic nigga thats always quick to fill a
Nigga for a [unverified] 'cause I'm a muthafuckin' killer
Thriller from Manilla though I'm shown as the average
Try to test your luck and get bucked by a muthafuckin' savage
I creep and I crawl and I creep and I crawl
And I creep and I crawl creep creep
I said I creep and I crawl and I creep and I crawl
And I creep and I crawl creep creep
I got my niggas from gravestreet watts
I got my niggas from the CPT
I got my niggas all across the muthafuckin' land
Thats down with the Eazy-E
Now , later on that night as I'm rollin'
Lookin' for a nigga I can gat and pack a hole in
Stoppin' at a light on the latenight
Fire up a Phillie Blunt to get my head right
See some niggas slippin' at a burger stand
And in my mind all I'm thinkin' is a murder plan
Creepin' through the drive through kinda slow
I got my hot beams on the back of the 4
Yo, smokin' on chronic with the rag down
Not knowin' I'm about to lay their ass down
Reach for them fools make my move
Leaned out my jeep and I creep kinda smooth
With the gat to the nigga's dome now he's sleeps
One shot to the top body flopped on the seat
Peep , I dumped on the lil' skinny passenger
A bitch is screamin' in a rage so I blasted her
Smashed and I got about 5 blocks
Before I got stopped by punk ass cops
(Shit , fuck 'em )
Fuck you, muthafucka
Ha, ha, ha
