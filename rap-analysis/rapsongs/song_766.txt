Now who comin' with that hot shit?
  (Once again Brand Nubian)
Who about to rock shit?
  (Once again Brand Nubian)
Super splashy with that head knot
  (Once again Brand Nubian)
Seal it down 'cause it don't stop
  (Once again Brand Nubian)
Now as I blast off with my curricula, comin' perpendicular
Watch me kill it when I spill it, top bill it, shine like acrylic
Actions manifest with the strategy of chess
Hit you with more retardedness than the seed born from incest
Since the scrotum I was that brother ripped a hole in my daddy's rubber
Swan dived into my mother left behind a thousand others
Caught one cat sittin' in the egg, tossed him out he slid down the leg
Born months later, I come ridin' down the escalator
Doctor tried to smack me but I caught him with a two piece
My pops said, "Son you did it right, aww man my shorty tight"
Then he passed the brother a mic and ever since my flow been tight
Come on, you gotta be kidding me if you think Brand Nu' lost a step
And if you do go get a late pass 'cause you cats done overslept
Over two thousand emcees attend school at Haji Prep
Brand Nubian brothers, A alike, B alike, plus we see alike
'Cause ain't nuthin' but that blazeness when these brothers touch the mic
Now who comin' with that hot shit?
  (Once again Brand Nubian)
Who about to rock shit?
  (Once again Brand Nubian)
Super splashy with that head knot
  (Once again Brand Nubian)
Seal it down 'cause it don't stop

The rap legend, never pushed a Legend, gripped the mic
With my bredderns, like Kryptonite we steal your powers
Like Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos we come back
To reveal the seventh seal, the drum track's the soundtrack for war
Hardcore righteous, the nicest
Comin' with advice that's priceless, to help the crisis
It was felt by some, you wouldn't like this
Now we got you strung like you sniffin' that white bitch
Flippin' the tongue, even at a high pitch, we run
Shit like diarrhea, we burn that ass like gonorrhea
You learn your past through the eyes of the overseer
Me, I earn my cash tellin' the truth
They wanna make a felon out of every black youth
My nigga Stick Man got the cracked tooth
Steady yellin' in the booth, we got big plans to make loot
Waitin' for the seeds we plant to take root
Who comin' with that hot shit?
  (Once again Brand Nubian)
Who about to rock shit?
  (Once again Brand Nubian)
Super splashy with that head knot
  (Once again Brand Nubian)

I'm here seven nights a week, no charge
And for two drink minimum, the Wild Cowboy number one
With them C-Town and Manhattan street pose
To they dancers on Thursday's for all the lost souls
Laid out in bed she offering, don't want the pussy
Fell for the hype but now I wanna stretch her
'Cause her convo is slow, there's a lot of shit she don't know
But she young and firm, she'll learn
We hit them niggaz in the middle of the month, check day
And in a future life I will probably pay
But who's to say, 'cause I'm right here today, and death to spray
You wanna get some smoke see my man Jose
You want somethin' stronger got to wait a little longer
From the Harley Houses to the Brasley Houses
To my City Park youth throwin' rocks off the roofs
And my sons downtown, they don't give a fuck
Let the flames off from inside of the truck
My OT pipeline will stop your lifeline
Make your wife blind and best in your lifetime
No doubt
Once again, once again
Once again, once again
Once again, once again
Once again, once again
