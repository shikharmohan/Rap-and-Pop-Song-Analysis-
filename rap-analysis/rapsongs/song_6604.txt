Watch it, watch it, Daz is comin'
And there'll be no more waitin'
Watch it, watch it, Kurupt is comin'
And there'll be no more waitin'
Watch it, watch it, Doggystyle is comin'
And there'll be no more waitin'
You might be shootin', inna de place
If eedyot ever disrespectin', now
Now follow me deep in the depths of my mind
Think how many plots blossoms to how many times
I'm sedatin' my asphyxiated from beginnin' broke
And the bombast weed smoke that'll make a nigga choke
To my loc's way down in the Valley deep
To my homies in the Pound from L.A. and the Beach
To my bulls out in Philly, 'cause all they smoke is Phillies
With these silly-ass bitches out for a niggaz riches
Now really, will he ever slip or trip
A big shout out, to my niggaz in Darby Twip
I spits the vocabulary to sinks MC's like ships
With my nocturnal vibes and editorial clips
I got a click, that'll hit you like a thousand volts
The homies catchin' cases robberies and assaults
It ain't my fault that my shit might hit like that
Listen and get elevated off the verbal contact
When a nigga gotta strive for his he can't stop
Gotta get somewhere
Now when a nigga gotta mash for his he can't stop
Gotta get somewhere
My mind-state these days make the average nigga afraid
Hurt 'em in the worst way, put it down for myself
Put 'em to rest, confess, nevertheless
Snatch 'em a cap and destroy 'em at my best
For the simple fact with contact, we the block entourage
We drop bombs and we known to calm down the savage beast
And the rest of the jungle I'll mistreat
Any MC tryin' to fuck with D-A-Z
I represent it to the fullest, it could be a verbal massacre
In ninety-six, with a different approach on shit
I got the flavor, and I'm major
Busta-ass niggaz can't stop us, and can't fade us
Shady-ass niggaz can't stand next to ya
When the Tek connects to ya
Swift as a cheetah when I'm catchin' ya
I betcha I won't let ya escape, face the real on point
They're trained to kill, beyond the violated area
When the smoke clears the area whether I'm toast or at home
I blaze the zag or the bone once again another zone is gone
MC's try to step they get lit and blown
At the end the lights go out so before they do
I'm a L B C on through, stayin' true
Demandin' my respect, respect is what I've given
So respect is what I expect
The money got me driven to the point of no return
So the streets I roam don't catch chrome to the dome
Of this flack black 45 caliber glock gat, gun, or pistol
Whistle, and watch all my homeboys come
Run, or hear the click, damn that shit that you get hit with
When we bust, I let loose this is pre-meditated dick-up
To all the busters that jealous and hate it, but can't fade it
With they every attempt they fail, oh well consequences get suffered
I put pressure on sucker motherfuckers the bill is crisp
The deal is this, I gotta plot 'em on a mash for my chips
Get in my way and get stepped on
I'm stompin', steppin', with my projectile weapon
With subjects all subject to harm, when I swarm through
Who knew about the real deal I conceal?
And still, can you feel, the topic of the whole situation is trust
No hoe is a must
If I bust my brain constructs to form knowledge to the max
Defeatin' and deletin' elevation set backs
We wax tracks and smack up MC's who compose the violence
Bringin' drama, with no parental guidance
Eyes went deceived, somethin' up my sleeve to intrigue
And these MC's will be G's also D P G's and, L B C's
When we do the do to you so go call your crew
And who, wants to compete with Techniec
Conflict will be verbal
So watch how you speak
And what you say when I display
Sleepless acts that's bomb to ya, suffer from insomnia
And I'ma, gonna be comin' for you
So please be on the lookout for the Doggystyle Crew
Watch out nigga
It's a sucker MC barbecue cookout
Look out, watch out now
Yeah, witcha bad self, watch out
