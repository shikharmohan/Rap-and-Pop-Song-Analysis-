You know what time it is
You know who the this is
Danger, danger, get on the floor
The right here, sing it
Been so long since he's been on
So please show me what it is that you want to see
Go tell the DJ to put my on, I'm keepin' you and in jump
From the minute I get on, taking they shit off, showing they tattoos
Screamin, and hollerin' and all, got the gift to come up with it
Put it together, deliver, make them feel it, I been on
Sharp! Pulled me out the pencil sharpener
Bad! Like that student in the principal's office
Put rappers in coffins, they dive like dolphins
I'm the [Incomprehensible] lyrical marvel [Incomprehensible] officer
Watch yourself around, get beside yourself, I know
Go ahead though, bounce them, shake that, drop that, stay in line
A think, 'cuz you can can, cocked up, head down
Poppin' on a handstand, leave that smoking
If you gonna lose something then bend over, and bust that open
Been so long since he's been on
So please show me what it is that you want to see
Been so long since he's been on
So please show me what it is that you want to see
My concert line around the corner, parking cars, lookin', nothing on her
You lookin' good momma, Why? Pshh, what's up homie?
Sirens, Limousines, and the club owner, ya you
If you late, ain't no getting in this 'cuz it's filling up
Inside packed from the floor to the ceiling up
The building ain't big enough, I'm backstage bouncing
Adrenalin building up, the cutter, did I stutter? The heart flooder
Make your woman drawers melt like butter
Down like Nelly, hype like Belly, the rhyme seller, kick like Jim Kelly
Stand up, round out, boot up and frown, tell a if he wanna try it
Then come on down, no sweat, no blood, no tears
And if I tell you it's the then that's what it is
Been so long since he's been on
So please show me what it is that you want to see
Been so long since he's been on
So please show me what it is that you want to see
Danger, talkin 'bout, danger, mother look
Get on the floor, the right here
Danger, watch your back, danger, look, look what!
Get on the floor, the right here, get 'em up
Been so long since he's been on
So please show me what it is that you want to see
Been so long since he's been on
So please show me what it is that you want to see
Danger, danger
Get on the floor, the right here
Sing it, danger, danger
Get on the floor, the right here
This is my mother floor
