Hook:
Well I think I'm going out of my head
Yes, I think I'm going out of my head,
I think I'm, think I'm, think I'm....
Life's a bitch then you never come back...
Yo! peep the realness...
Verse One:
I'm a shadow of my former self
So when the sun sets west,
I rock and slap box with hip-hop;
'cause its much harder to get props than it is to fall off and flop
I payed dues til I paid do nots.
And will never will what you say affect the outcome --
See, momma always told me opinions are like assholes;
'cause everyone has got one.
But you couldn't tell me shit if I stepped in it.
Once I enter psychosis, paranormal, focus I perplex niggas and niggettes,
I play this rap shit closer than gilettes against the neck and juglar vien
Blowing out my own fucking brain without lead projectiles,
Bled when I project styles and meanwhile, existence is a life sentence
And since I'm broke I take the risk, forced to hustle
''cause raw power moves, require muscle knowing I'm going out trife
Already got one strike, two more and that's life without possibility of
paroll
Having to stroll in my shoes ain't easy
Lookin' forward to 3 hots from a cell block fuckin' my fifi nigga feel me?
''cause if it ain't the cancer sticks I hit this hypertension's gonna kill me
And fuck a platinum plaque, all I want is a niggas dap
And enough snaps to put clothes on my daughters back Steph.
See this without an optometrist I'm stuck in the middle of this bitch -
Like ya momma's gynacologist.
Make a radio hit - headz criticize it;
Underground classic - nobody buys it:
So, rap is fucked
And everything blowing up sounds redundant
But money talks and bullshit does 9 flat in the hundred
And goddamn if I don't slam my wallets in danger
So I'm coming out like unborn baby's with hangers
And chronic stress is comtemplated so fuck being high Ras Kass is elevated
Chorus:
Well I think I'm going out of my head, reelishymn, reelishymn
Yes, I think I'm going out of my head, reelishymn, reelishymn
Well I think I'm going out of my head
Yes, I think I'm going out of my head
Verse Two:
Who can I blame 'cause my skull can't contain these thought waves
My syntax hydroplanes as though my brain
Slides over liquidated grains of asphault caught cranial calluses
Over analysis leads to paralysis, mediocrity my nemesis
Try to fuck every radical feminist I meet, call it engage and defeat
That's the reason why black men hide in the womb, homes
'cause life is all taxes and tombstones
So as flesh and bone I zone my thoughts explode with rap shranel syntax;
That'll wax to the past, and present the future of Ras Kass lies in the
skull
Like the coronal suture
So I write truly fat shit for the core audience
But sometimes I wonder does it really exist?
'cause true lyricists in hip-hop Joe Public be dissin
Niggas don't relate
Elevate and its treated like elevator music
'cause' nigga don't listen
But ridicle is the burden of genius
Have you ever seen this socioeconomic gullitine rip?
A nigga's hopes and dreams
And now I'm lead to believe that life is all about CREAM
I'm living a life idealistically principle over profit
But realistically good intentions are micropic to fat pockets
Exploitation is world's oldest occupation
And it's the task of Jamaican chicken when a nigga gets jerked
Causing me to revert to verses -
Versus snapping like your neighborhood post office worker
(Before the Source and Rappages)
Niggas said my rhyme wasn't fly now I have the juice like Omar Epps
And crooked I
Fools be on my dick like foreskin
But what before then, so now when niggas prop me I'm skeptical
Be'cause this rap shit is extremely unethical
And with slight notoriety comes anxiety
Now I'm supposed to play celebrity when nobody celebrated me at my D.O.B
And label reps wanna play me;
But I'm familar with record company rule #4080:
Fuck Luther and Sadie for talking food out my babies mouth denying sample
clearance
I'm losing my mind
Outter body experience it's paranormal
I say it ain't all good though
So fuck the world with an AIDS infected dildo (doggy style)
Life's a bitch named monogamy -- you only get one --
I'm trapped in this path of pathology
Chorus:
And I think I'm going out of my head, check it, reelishymn, reelishymn
Yes, I think I'm going out of my head, check it out, reelishymn,
reelishymn
Well I think I'm going out of my head, reelishymn, reelishymn
Yes, I think I'm going out of my head, it's the reelishymn
Well, I think I'm x 7, Yes, I think I'm x 7... 
Here come the remaining beautiful people
And for all of you who survive, we hope you enjoyed the ride
2002 will see some new added features
Such as the Spinal Spinning Spiral Splitter
And the Corkscrew Cock Cruncher
Plus, the Fat Fuckin' Bitch Backslapper
And not forgetting The One Finger Ringer
So, until next time boys and girls, goodbye
Cunters journey home, toodaloo, ta, ta and fuck off
From the 'Rollercoaster Malpractice'
(Redman)
They done let me out
(Redman)
They done called my name
(Redman)
They done read the four chapters
Now I'm back, Brick City, I've been born again
Master, hit the switch, Igor, he's alive
Yo, set it off, set it off, yo, yo, yo
Let's start ridin', my flows bring the tide in
While John Cochran break your pride in
I shagged her before you married her
Took the ring, pawned it for an Acura
DOC, breakin' the sound barrier
Hardcore bullet, fo'-fo' pull it
Got your camp runnin', used it for footage
Brick City suspects couldn't [unverified]
Yo, watch me leap through trees
Attackin' sharks in the Deep Blue Sea
Aim lock on, Goldeneye
War in the snow storm, with double, oh on
U.K. blow your horns
Put you in, I.C.U., gettin' blood drawn
Doc did it off an Adam F bomb
I move like Robotron, turn the lights off
Girl she had a big fat ass, we smokin' weed tonight
We smokin' weed tonight, c'mon
What I want everybody to do right now
Is blow your motherfuckin' horns, louder, louder
Yo, if you want that shit
(That shit)
That hardcore rough shit
(Rough shit)
Motherfuckers, blow your horns
Then smash sumthin', crash sumthin'
If you want that shit
(That shit)
That smoke and fuck a bitch shit
Motherfuckers, blow your horns
Then smash sumthin, crash sumthin'
Yo, yo yo, from hunger, to hungry, to hungriest
Pack two cannons by the pancreas
Your whole camp enlists, abandon ship
Push your knuckles up and dance with it
I'll shut down cops, steal they badges
Off of 'Operation Kill Da Wabbit'
PPP niggaz be jackin' cabbage
Looked in the camera and pull the mask up
Laughin' at ya, yeah I x'd you out
Somebody help him out with mouth to mouth
You to me son, what you talkin' 'bout?
If your third eye look then I gorge it out
Bitches fuck me barely walkin' out
For a thievin' ass hoe fo' mark it out
It's one mo' body in the hall for now
Verbal assault killer, calm him down
I open fire, made you retire
Hung your shoes from a telephone wire
So when I ride by, I brag on it
Paragraphs fly wit toe tags on it
I plant a bomb where you pick your mail up
It's bricks, so y'all hit the fallout shelter
Doc, niggaz, bitches, jump up
Criminals, hustlers, hoes, jump up
Yo, if you want that shit
(That shit)
That hardcore rough shit
(Rough shit)
Motherfuckers, blow your horns
Then smash sumthin, crash sumthin'
If you want that shit
(That shit)
That smoke and fuck a bitch shit
Motherfuckers, blow your horns
Then smash sumthin, crash sumthin'
