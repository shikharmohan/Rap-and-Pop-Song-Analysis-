Ziggi, ziggi, ziggi
Ha ha ha, yo
Ya'll, y'all, y'all
Yo, I walk through brick walls
Fuck around hijack your whole shopping malls
I be rippin' shit, that's my word bond
Scream then I watch the whole planet earth respond
Do just what ya told the remote control
Crash cars and shit ya know how we role
When I tumble and drive then you reply
My my my my my my
Yo I execute all plans
Run up in two bitches for me and my mans
Ha, breakin' flows, ha for my fans
In my turn, they just give me the sound
Strike matches, golden egg hatches
Request line is open send all your faxes
Freaks the flows with no rehersan
Pull the skate back which when the beat start reversin'
Just so wak you make people start cursin'
Flows contradict worser than the King James version
Turn on the mic but your shit will stop workin'
Beats brudlized your whole rhyme, your head hurtin'
Broom sticks and britches from rags to riches
Forget mad love want y'all niggas to burn bitches
Amateur, why won't you look right at the calender
A matter of time before I start to damage ya
So starting to just bust my rhyme calbo
Consecutive wounds like a nigga stamager
Ya, my whole team get wild cream
Poloticin' every move to the extreme
So hardcore like Gwackjaw McGraw
Fuck what you heard you ain't heard this before
So hardcore like Gwackjaw McGraw
Fuck what you heard you ain't heard this before
Hardcore like Gwackjaw McGraw
Fuck what you heard you ain't heard this before
So hardcore like Gwackjaw McGraw
Fuck what you heard you ain't heard this before
Ha, yo I come right through the door
With rhymes galore Busta Rhymes be the imbasator
Explore my metaphor you beg for more
Hardcore serious surely insurcure
I said my whole squad of niggas come through and break the law
My family tight more than collect four
I come through and create the master pieces
Bend your mind with rhyme colictalictist
Ya'll, I will break shit down
Lost or found floor will blast like a four pound
Right before I hit you off with my vaccine
Starch, cobohidrates lots of protein
Vaccine baby girl yo I hope your ass clean
Magazine frontine fly lips is lime green
Ya'll, every time ya'll, I'm on the scene
High beam the lights and watch will remain supreme, ha
Don't ya know when I keep it comin'
Blow the fort, make ya wrist hard to hand cuffin'
Bounce on the beat and watch how a nigga work it
Buck wild makin' ya speaker short curcit
This heavy weight tip the scale on the triple beam
Busta Rhymes blast and still bang the main screen, blow
I had ta make ya all mad
Hit ya off, interlude, bounce to Trinidad
Know I see a bitch nigga soft
Make a nigga cough, breakin' and turn ya ass off
Extra raw l lay on your back and on the floor
Busta rhymes got to headline the whole ball
'Cause we so hardcore like Gwackjaw McGraw
Fuck what you heard we ain't heard this before
So hardcore like Gwackjaw McGraw
Fuck what you heard you ain't heard this before
Hardcore like Gwackjaw McGraw
Fuck what you heard you ain't heard this before
So hardcore like Gwackjaw McGraw
Fuck what you heard you ain't heard this before
Y'all
