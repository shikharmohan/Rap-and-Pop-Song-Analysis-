Ooh, ooh, close the door
I'ma goin' in and that fo' sure
Gonna lay ya out, out, out
And I know you luv a nigga breakin' it down
Every time I'm with her
I get her hoo, I get her hoo, luv drunk
Every time she's with
She in me, luv drunk
You know who I am, I'm the mothafuckin' dogg
The sheets fucked up and you know it was me
You hit a bedspreak all way down the street
It sounds like a song we fuckin' to the beat
I put ma rat-tat-tat in her boom boom pow
Then she put her tit-tit-tit all up in my mouth
I told you before I don't luv them ho's
But she got that good, good, can't let her go
And I gotta let her know
Every time I'm with her
I get her hoo, I get her hoo, luv drunk
Every time she's with
She in me, luv drunk
She make me say good luv that's what she's feelin' fo'
And I got that fire luvin, the more you need the more ooh
Lemme say ooh, ooh, aah, aah
Every time she's with me, me I'm dizzy
Shoot to the spot 'cause the spot is the lick
Pull your lunch break, lemme hit it real quick
Back to your job before they know what is
Luvin' so good, we already made three kids
I don't know what it is but I luv what I did
Huggin' and touchin' and all that shit
Drink to your drunk, see my luv is a fill
Yea, this for you boo it's a gift
Every time I'm with her
I get her hoo, I get her hoo, luv drunk
Every time she's with
She in me, luv drunk
She make me say good luv that's what she's feelin' for
And i got that fire luvin', the more you need the more ooh
Lemme say ooh, ooh, aah, aah, oh yeah
Every time she's with me, me I'm dizzy
