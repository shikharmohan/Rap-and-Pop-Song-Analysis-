These things just took over me
Just took over my whole body
So I can't even see no more
I'm calling my black woman a bitch
I'm calling my peoples all kinds of thing that they not
I'm lost brother, can you help me?
Can you help me brother, please?
You see what we did, we lost the love
I'm talking 'bout the love, the love of your own
But brother, but brother, but brother, check this out
I still don't understand, man, I'm all high off this shit, man
Well, what I'm trying to say my brother
Why, why do we kill each other?
Look at our children, what kind of a future?
This is the training that's gonna be given to you
By the Wu, brothers and sisters, the revolution, the revolution
It's time to rise and take our place
Will be televised, televised, so we can inherit the universe
The planet earth belongs to God, this is ninety, ninety, ninety-seven
Every square inch of it that he chose for himself is the best part
Yeah, the revolution should be, televised
By every strong woman to the highest power
You'll find a strong man and by every strong man
You'll find a strong woman, won't you agree?
The universe is not completed without the sun, moon, and stars
Won't you be for real? That's man, woman, and child
To the highest power, to all you fake ass niggas
Who think you gonna survive out here
Without your black woman, you're wrong
They have attraction powers on the planet, I wanna be free
We are original man, the Asiatic black man
The maker, the Arthur, the cream of the planet earth
Wanna be free, yeah
Father of civilization and daughter of the universe
Want to be free, oh yeah
The population was seventeen men with the two man Indians
Making a total of nineteen men for all
Being, for all men, all over the planet earth
Magneta, magneta, magneta, Wu revolution king, yeah
Arise you God's 'cuz the time for the revolutional war
That's the mental war
Malcolm X, Malcolm X, Malcolm X
That's the battle between God and devil, gonna be free
Take the devil off your plane, take him off your mental mentality
Take him off your brain, make a change from my mind
Leave all the cigarettes and guns, the alcohol and everything
That's the mental devil that exists within your body
Take this pain that's destroying and decaying your mind
Take these chains off my mind, the mind controls the body
Everything within must come out, want to be free
Don't look towards the sky 'cuz there's no heaven above
Don't look down beneath your feet, there's no hell below
Want to be free but heaven and hell exist within
Heaven is what you make it and hell is what you're going through
There is only one God, there is a whole new one, faith
There is a holy one world, revolution, yeah
At one time it was told to me, yeah
That man came from monkeys, ha ha ha
That we were swingin' from trees
I hardly can believe that unless I'm dumb deaf and blind
Save the children, you ever heard about, the ape man?
Gonna be free and the ape woman?
Hey, want to be free
You have a mankind, that has a beginning to him
And his ending is about to come, ooh, yeah
If you take one step I will take one with you
Through the stormy vein swim the deepest sea, with you my brother
I know, you got to be strong, gotta hold on
Now the story is about to close, it was a hundred percent of us
Save the children that came on the slave ships
Eighty five percent of our people, they're our future
Was uncivilized, poison animal eaters
They're slaves of the mental powers, save the children
They don't know who the true and living God is
And all the orchards in the world, save the children
So they worship what they know not
And they're easily lead in the wrong direction
And hard to be lead in the right
And now you got the ten percent
Who are rich slave makers of the poor
Who teach the poor lies that make the people believe
That the all mighty true and living God is a spook in the sky
Save the children and you can't see him with the physical eyes
They're also known as blood suckers of the poor
Save the children and then you got the five percent
Who are the poor righteous teachers
Who do not believe in the teachings of the ten percent
Save the children
Who is all wise and know who the true and living God is
And teach that the true and living God is
Supreme being black man from Asian
Otherwise known as civilized people
Also Muslims, and Muslims sons, peace we out
I have given it much thought
It seems, disaster must come
At best, only postponed, Shaolin Kung-Fu
To survive must now be taught, to more young men
We must expand, get more pupils
So that the knowledge will spread
