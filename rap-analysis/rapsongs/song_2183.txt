Testing testing, Bosko where they at
Tonight swinger what we getting into
If you wanna dance we can do it tonight
If you wanna smoke, c'mon it's alright
If you wanna drink, c'mon we popping Don Perion
Doing the damn thang 'til the dawn
If you wanna dance we can do it tonight
If you wanna smoke, c'mon it's alright
If you wanna drink, c'mon we popping Don Perion
Doing the damn thang 'til the dawn
Love me tender, love me sweet, I'm a thug, pack my heat
All I do is spit these ki's, L-I-P's, overseas
Get your feddy, stack your bread
Make them duck heads give you head
If it's money, 'bout them dollas
Jack your stacks and pop your collars
Ooh, fa shiggedel
So slick, so sly, so slal
Ghost pick, those thighs, those gals
Came prepared, to my last show
Fire it up, wire it up off of the a sal
Hide in the birds trying to throw it at me now
Let me breathe on you for a minute as I snatch up
This fine ass little brusslesprout and I have to apprehend her
If you wanna dance we can do it tonight
If you wanna smoke, c'mon it's alright
If you wanna drink, c'mon we popping Don Perion
Doing the damn thang 'til the dawn
Now guess what, what, chicken butt
Bitch goody goody, wait a minute
It wouldn't be cracking if my cousin
4-Tre wasn't in it, goody goody
Now if you wanna dance, smoke, drink
We got the party cracking like all for you baby
Goody goody, god, make a pimp wanna jump back
Goody goody, don't stop, the beat rock
'Cause we hot, the heat rock, and don't stop
Believing, just get your money where you're breathing
This is for the thugs set butts in they laps, goody goody
And this is for E-40 and The Click in the land, goody goody
If you wanna dance we can do it tonight
If you wanna smoke, c'mon it's alright
If you wanna drink, c'mon we popping Don Perion
Doing the damn thang 'til the dawn
I prosaic, chemically imbalanced
Black folks, lactose and talerance
Red cup, strictly riding gut
Hard licking tricking, bitch playa banked up
Love the baby with the big butt
Walking up, to my F5-50 truck
What's your name, Sandra
Like that, where you from, Atlanta
Love me tender, love me sweet, I'm a thug, pack my heat
All I do is spit these ki's, L-I-P's, overseas
Get your feddy, stack your bread
Make them duck heads give you head
If it's money, 'bout them dollas
Jack your stacks and pop your collars
If you wanna dance we can do it tonight
If you wanna smoke, c'mon it's alright
If you wanna drink, c'mon we popping Don Perion
Doing the damn thang 'til the dawn
If you wanna dance we can do it tonight
If you wanna smoke, c'mon it's alright
If you wanna drink, c'mon we popping Don Perion
Doing the damn thang 'til the dawn
'Til the dawn
