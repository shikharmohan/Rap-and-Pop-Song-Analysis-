(Lil' Lay tell 'em) Look, my flow style is ridiculous, like E-40 I'm sick with it/ Done stacked up my benjamins, I'm caked up with dividends/ I wake up my presidents, I ball out, that's evident/ My money don't RIP, we hit streets and stay relevant/ You can tell how I'm bailin' in, glistenin' and shinin'/ If a lick call, I'm hittin' it/ Thirty Mil and still grindin'/ It's all about perfect timin' yup, nigga don't need no fuckin' help/ It's all about bread till I'm dead, I'm goin' for self/ Now give me good wealth and give me good health and longevity/ Pride is kept only where the cheddar be/ Nobody beggin' me, can't get ahead of me/ Translate the music to dollars, check out my melody/ I hustle to get it, I gotta go get it, I'm about expansion/ I live it and breathe it, nigga from Cleveland, I got mansions/ Upgradin' to castles, life with no hastles/ Regals, the Madebach shit, everything I ask for 
-Chorus-AK (Layzie)- 
Hey, I got my money-money-money right (Dollar bills) I got my money-money-money right (Dollar bills) I got my money-money-money right (Dollar bills/ Hundred dollar bills, we got hundred bills)

Layzie Bone 
(That's right. Lil' Lay tell 'em.) I just bought a '09 Denali on some brand new rims/ 26 inches tell 'em that I'm worth what I spend/ I got it, I'm a flaunt it/ I'm a make these niggas want it like I did since I was a kid, I'm a grown man, shit/ Square bids up and down, why you pressin' your luck? I'm a Bone, Do Or Die with AK in the trunk/ I mean AK in his lap, that means we heavily strapped/ And if we roll on you niggas that means we rat-tat-tat-tat-tat/ "Pap, pap, pap" when it comes to the money/ You coward mother fuckers ain't gon' take nothin' from me/ I'm a bet I'm a G these niggas want to be/ Midwest to overseas, my niggas about the cheese/ Niggas please, freeze, drop it down/ You roll money by the pound, oh, you a hero? Belo Zero, nigga, lay it down/ You don't make what you want, I'm a take what you got, got, got/ Better shit or get off the pot 
-Chorus-AK (Layzie)- 
Hey, I got my money-money-money right (Dollar bills) I got my money-money-money right (Dollar bills) I got my money-money-money right (Dollar bills/ Hundred dollar bills, we got hundred bills)
