I'm a chicken hawk, huntin' for a chicken
Get paranoid when you hear my Glock clickin'
Speakin' to the punk-ass victim
With the bitch-ass styles I hit you like Deacon
Jones house, cough without the bones
I rolled ya up and smoked you like bones
Split the seed and grow you like clones
Don't start-me-up, 'cause I'm not the Rolling Stones
But I get stoned with a little help from my friends
With the gubla, then I passed it round back to me again
I can make you famous like Amos
Same as the last punk, when I stuck the gatt up his anus
Hear me growl grrra, howl
I got the night vision just like the wise old owl
I'm comin' ta fetch ya, yeah homes I'll wet ya
Bury them bones under my home and
Cock the hammer
Cock the hammer, it's time for action
Cock the hammer
Cock the hammer, it's time for action
Take my weapon, step into a whole new realm
And step back as I take up the helm
On the pirate ship I'm steerin'
Jump into gear and just realize what you're hearin'
The cannon's soundin'
That's my companions surroundin'
As my crew comes pounding
It's the captain, Afro-America
Whole lotta gattin' with the loc'ed out Latin
Bust that
You're a red beard with a musket
Better duck quick 'cause ya might get dusted
Your gatt looks rusted, disgusted
Oh look away, look away boy as I rush it
Yes, I know that you can't withstand it
Watch that ass 'cause punk I'll brand it
With a steel-toe, how you feel now
When my boot stuck in that ass like a dildo
Cry on a pillow, weeper that's willow
The Hill got the skill for the static like Brillo
Hmmm, what you talkin' `bout punk
Gimme room as I light up the boom
Cock the hammer, wave the white banner
Ever heard a glock go click like a camera?
Cock the hammer
Cock the hammer, it's time for action
Cock the hammer
Cock the hammer, it's time for action
Cock the hammer
Cock the hammer, it's time for action
Cock the hammer
Cock the hammer, it's time for action
