Yo-ho
Chorus:
Gitty up baby (gitty up, gitty up)
Say what? gimmie all that you got
Baby don't stop
Keep it comin' strong, make it hot, say what? 
(chorus)
Gitty up baby, i'm-a take you for a ride
It makes your soul wild when I release vibes
Freak ya down till your asthma hit ya
Salt, non-stop styles, lift ya
Make you wanna get your stash
Blowin' like the wind, no need, got my own ends
Player-haters never win 'cause I'm a ball to the end
Send chill up your skin poppie
Who the fake? not me
Can't take what I got, can't stop me
Feel the vibe, ride bass slide
Yo, can't fight it ho
Let it flow and move, show and prove
We can do this, shake your groove thing
Hold tight, ain't nothin' to this
Wanna get down with skills
Romance and no frills? 
Uh, it feels ill, don't it? 
Yo-ho
(chorus x2)
I keep it hot like a block full of hustlers
Who can make it blaze like us? 
Bless you to death, wanna freak me from the back? 
(girl, don't even play like that)
Keep it comin' strong, give me all that you got
(chi-co, true baller don't stop)
I throw it like a pitcher, let my sex appeal hit ya
Game so sharp that it split ya
Playa what, keep your style in order
(I ain't been hooked since ewing was a hoya)
I'm-a party till I see the sunrise
S 'n p keep the party live
Keep it comin' baby
(chorus)
Gitty up baby
Gimmie that s and p, that sweet and funky stuff
(say what? )
Gimmie that s and p, that sweet and funky stuff
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
Give me the funk, that sweet... yo-ho
Yo-ho
(chorus x2)
Gitty up baby
You can buy that
Feel the bass and hi-hat
You can buy that
Feel the bass and hi-hat
