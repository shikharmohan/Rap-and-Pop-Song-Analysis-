Lil Cease 
(Mr.Bristal) 
Sipping Hansun 
Got dough like the Hansons 
Bitches come fast and out like Helly Hansen 
Mister Bristal you will neva catch me dancing 
Off the prancing 
Only in a mansion 
In a party high and drunk 
I see you glancing 
Never blow my cool even if its jammin 
Is the bitch is a feed I got a cannon 
Cock, Lick shots, Leave them where they standing 
You can call the cops I never get ran in 
Call Blake C. yall get the understanding 
Who my man is, who the fam is 
All that bullshit you talk, can it 
We own the planet 
Its a definite 
Niggas go for money reppin it 
Armagedding it 
Everything we on we setting it 
You delicate 
Farr away in the country where you better get 
Yall need to get with some veterans 
Chorus: (Harve Pierre) 
You don't wanna play around

You don't wanna play around...with me 
No more.....I'll kill you 
(Lil Cease) 
Yo Yo Yo 
Niggas wanna start shit

Me and Brist about to lock down the market 
Gats they spark it

Got crips and bloods that pop ??? 
B.Rock I'm a die for you 
Til this day I'm a ride for you 
God forbid I die too 
When you pull that gack 
I'll be right besides you 
To guide you 
On who to hit and not to 
If a niggas guilty he got to die to 
Thats the reala 
They talking to the roach killa 
The most illa 
About to upset New York like Reggie Miller 
Plus they say you turn thug you turn killa 
Its hard to turn back when a nigga feel ya 
That's why they say don't nobody know you til sombody kill ya 
That's why I say stay back, don't get to familiar 
Cause if you get to close my niggas might fucking kill ya

(Lil Kim) 
Fuck all yall hoes I blows like suits 
Bitches don't shake my hand 
They salute, the leutinent 
Rich men kiss the back of the hand of the royal heiness..pocanhantas..mafia behind this 
Balling like Utah 
Didn't think a ghetto bitch could come this far 
From pushing buicks to candle apple red jaguars 
Niggas think I'm rich 
I could rock a fubu suit...a furry kangol and some cowboy boots 
And still be the shit of the night 
When I come through 
You be on the side holding your cups like the bums do 
Waiting for the queen to put some change in it 
I pull out a g and drop it 
With a hundred grand left in my pocket 
I promoted this shit 
So I got to make a profit 
And all the ends I sends to my mens down in Scarfett 
Me and Lil Cease in partuni partners 
Laying niggas down like carpenters 
So pardon us 
Like Nikes, we just do it 
We aint ameteurs to this shit 
We used to it 
And all the bodies I killed 
I keep them on file 
So when there anniversaries come 
We pop Cristal 
Ask Chrystal, the golden child Tow dow! 
Take it how I give it 
You talk shit 
We live it 
Don't forget it 
(Puff) 
Stop trying to sound like her too 
Chrous plus ad libs from Lil Kim and Puff till fade
