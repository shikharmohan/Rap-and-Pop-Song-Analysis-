[Intro: Krayzie]
That's right Bone Thugs-N-Harmony back up in this muthaf**ka
Nigga, duce double 0 duce
Lay, B, Wish Flesh
(Bone Thug Bone Thug Bone Thug)
I think its time we take these niggas back to the god-damn
streets (swattin nigga)
And gave these niggas some of that original (original cleveland
heat) heat
Thuggish ruggish bone see
Gun stack off
[Verse 1: Layzie]
See a nigga got fully automatics and I let them loose
Tha 12 gauge two grenades nigga got them too
Ya damn right I shoot
If a nigga run up on you I'ma get him and I spill like I s'posed
to do
And If I roll wit you
Ima be that little nigga off the hook man
Talk about look man
If I see anigga disrespect one mo time
Put out my foot on his line and leave him burnt up cookin
Yeah I break off off my heat 'cause when I'm in the streets
And I hit these streets
I'ma keep my peace until a nigga want beef
But If he f**kin wit me then Ima turn raw meat 'cause
I'm just a Bone Thug little bitty nigga wit strong nutz
Platinum eva since E put us down
You know the talk of the town them long bud
Now you f**kin wit a lion strugglin tryin to see these thugs
Tryna get rid of us like the war on drugs
But a nigga keep comin like I told you he was
So lemme close the door
Don't be comin to this muthaf**ka knockin
Lookin for some action

Nigga it's our time and hell yeah we blastin
[Hook: Krayzie]

You ain't gotta listen but I'ma let you hear it
Pump, Pump, Buck buck buck buck buck

[Verse 2: Krayzie]
Leathaface in the place and I'm warned you niggas

Movin and huntin, steady winnin out a nigga
With penetration equivalent to muthaf**kin pistols
I get up in ya system cripple a nigga quick
I'm rippin a nigga shit like grippin a nigga bitch and sell this
You see I shoot fo the temple
I'ma try to bust a nigga mental in the middle of his dome
Back up in this muthaf**ka wait a minute nigga we neva left
Ain't even got started yet (yeah)
We kickin in the muthaf**kin door
Once again for war so nigga get ya army ready
I got a nation of niggas ready to f**k up the enemy
If i give em the order them nigga show me they warriors
All ova we victorious takin ova ya territory
Notorious and devil-alition and we know a level
All you feel it when I kill it hit it spit it
Get it crackin in this muthaf**ka right when we the illest
Same muthaf**kas got the f**k up outta Cleveland
Nigga we came up but we still creepin
And we still put it down nigga even though we four strong
Flesh gone come home, Bone gone stay Bone
When the 5th Dawg gets loose it gone be on
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Bizzy]
It's the original bang bang and I don't give a f**k about none
of these muthaf**kas
Still get down foe my damn thang
Tell a nigga that I concentrate come on down to the land let us

People lookin at me like he's too nasty to date
Gimme my dick back we in the last days every second got a
muthaf**ka passin away
Fast to the bass that we fell wit the jazz and ah [buck buck
buck buck buck buck buck buck]
In a mask at my home with no men in a mansion to get a little
piece of this American dream
I spit venom thru the pipes as I smoke in em
I shit rhythm and I'm nice ain't no competition [fart
sound] (Ewwww)
It smell good and the weed still sell good for the lay bits
Talkin bad like you ready to blaze nigga you ain't mad
(What the f**k you think you doing..........)
I give a f**k who you ridin with or that nigga that you slidin
with
He ain't a killa he just somebody to vibe with
Somebody tell this nigga motha who he died with
So silly!! [So silly silly silly silly ]
Pumped up Big Willy I don't really think he really
I don't really think he really, I don't think he know!
Hit him with the crossbow monto-mental little lost soul

[Hook]
[Verse 4: Wish Bone]
