Aha, what a beautiful day in the concrete jungle
I think I'll go down to Goliath and just be a fuckin' dickhead
Damn, I feel good today
I look forward to coming on and just beating the shit out of someone
And taking their money
What a fucking great job I have
I wonder why I feel so good
Could it be the music? Could it be my breakfast?
Or could it just be the fact that I just hate everybody, dammit it had to be
Life is grand, life is great, I need myself a real cheap date
Some woman I can take to McDonalds, spend a dollar twenty-five
On and have like, the best time of your life with afterwards
Life is too good to believe sometimes
But we all can't have it the way I do, so to all you suckers out there
Kiss off, alright? Bye bye
