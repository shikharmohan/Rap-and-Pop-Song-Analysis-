Step to it, know what I'm sayin'

We 'gone see about your motherfuckin' ass, nigga
If I do somethin' you don't like, come and see about it
You wanna box, get'cha dukes up, I'ma be 'bout it
And ride off into the sunset
With the windows down, feet out it
I got a foul mouth, I blow weed out it
Seperate these thighs, get the price and eat out it
Ain't no other bitch rowdy like me
S O, S O, D E F, you see cay
Y'all bitch ass niggas disbehave me since the first day
Worst way to kill 'em is hit the top of the charts
First week at number one, R and B be a war
Leave ya fake ass manager home
And if you eager nigga, to see about me, come along
I keep my enemies a far, don't need a friendly to leave
I make at least twenty five just to breathe on the beat
Tell me, how many niggas wanna fuck this bitch named Brat

You don't see 'em when I walk past
All smokin' in Hell, the so so, Da Brat brought

Known for breakin' the law, just came home
Get it on 'bout this damn microphone
Who the best? Who said this and who said that?
Here go three of the best on this goddamn track
And you can believe that, willing to bet my jive check
If you don't rewind this back somethin' wrong with deck

We gon' kill 'em in New Orleans like killa's from Georgia
As cold as Artic recorded in Georgia ninety proof thru the roof
Y'all niggas pink lemonade I hit the booth yo hold group bes' ventilated
Such a bunch of fuckin' cowards ain't worth the dirt
That come off my ass and go down the drain when I take my shower

I come from out that Cajun, I'm stayin ragin', keep it blazin'
Bitch I'm crazy, half man, half amazin'
Half way up the charts, and bitch I'm halfway in your ass
I'm only halfway with this rhyme, and got half y'all mad
Soon as I come in this bitch, you know I'm comin' to spit you somthin'
Then Michael Parker said, "That's a bad rappin' motherfucker"
I'll bust your ass up like a, mutherfuckin' bug stuck
On the windshield wiper, walkin'
Catch a temper tantrum from Mr. Shit Talker the vulgar
The champion'll knock you' show off
I'll cut 'cha like a Newport, with no gauze, oh don't
Bitch I'm stupid like I lost a few marbles
Still balkin', still tossin' 'em, still holdin' MC's hand
Takin' they ass across the street walkin'
So let me know when you ready to bust
With your head on the pavement
Bring your ass, you don't need no fuckin' invitation
Come and see about me
