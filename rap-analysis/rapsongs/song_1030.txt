*scratches*
In-Inhale (x6)
(Verse 1)
I breathe deep
Like an old man in a deep sleep
Or an Indian peace pipe in a tipi
The beginning, the end
The first, the last
Breath into eternity
The verse will last
Got a chick in the south that be cursin' fast
When it was she tried a nigga nurse it last (?)
Hunger of the homeless
Microphon-us
Played the game - it got a bonus
Man cuz the plan is the master like Tiger
So much drive
I am the definition of a rider
Daughter's name means survivor
From a tribe-a
Colliders
Just one word can't describe her
A scribe of the streets
And a good life that we all wanna reach
I'm hotter than a beach
Flow is so deep
Even underwater
I can inhale and put the world in order
*scratches* 
In-Inhale(x4)
(Verse 2)
Gaspin for air
Air everlasting
Raps that are rare
I write with christ
Passionate stare
Way to heaven is to stay in step
Rap this deep like my man Johnny Depp
You never know the next one god coulda kept
Soft as (
