Very forceful yeah, here we go now
Niggaz, bitches, where you at talk
Thug niggaz let me see y'all, yeah
Hah, before we slap niggaz silly with somethin'
And put you out your misery and your sufferin'
Oh oh, yeah, and just for frontin'
You got me bustin' two nines
With one hand tied together or somethin'
Ain't no mistakin' we takin' your trap
In case you niggaz didn't know
You fuckin' with the gladiators of rap
On some John Reno shit in professional
How we accurate and precise when we bust
And every move is intentional
Violate and I will get at yo' ass
And if I can't catch you track star
We'll start throwin' shit at yo' ass
Wait a minute nigga, hold up a second
See you'se a bitch and while we bust yo' ass
Yo' faggot peoples ain't even checkin'
Yo y'all need to send the coroner, shit
Leave you lookin' out a place
Like you'se a tourist on some foreigner shit
(Yea)
I be that nigga and I love to experiment
With specific high explosives
Just to take y'all niggaz out of this element, now
'Cause we got new shit for y'all
All my niggaz in the spots
Y'all know we tear the shit down and how we hold it nigga
And we come to take shit over y'all
Yes we here to regulate
And put our foot down, the shop is closin' nigga
Always rep the street for all y'all
Constantly hittin' y'all off with street shit
And keep y'all niggaz open, yeah
All my niggaz, all my bitches
Whatcha'all gon' do now
(Hah)
Every time we come with that street shit
  (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, we move like stone faced cold hearted niggaz
Baldfaced straight retarded niggaz
Aiyyo the shit we do be so off the hook
Fuck around and get yo' leg broken
Beat all in yo' face with ya foot
We here to stay, fuck payin' a visit
I only fuck with certain live niggaz
Like my niggaz Tash and Xzibit
Ever since I vowed to keep the shit raw
I stay hittin' niggaz with shit
That'll leave they fuckin' face on the floor
Every time niggaz know when we black
Smack a nigga so fuckin' hard
He'll fall and probably spin on his back
Funny how niggaz'll always shit talk
The very next day they will notice the difference
In the way they bitch walk
My street niggaz need to come for the ride
Cause when we step up in the place
You funny niggaz need to slide to the side
I love to watch these funny niggaz diminish
And while we slowly murder them niggaz
They prayin' on the moment we finish
I take you back to the very beginnin'
And beat you in yo' head from birth
And watch you grow lovin' the shit we be bringin'
Street niggaz keep they mind on they dream
Focus the most on gettin' they paper
And be thoroughly reppin' they team
You know we quick to mash it down for some hours
Quick to leave some of these niggaz shook
Runnin' with the rest of them cowards
(Yea)
And leave the rest of niggaz ready to dumb
And rep the street until we all die
Could give a fuck wherever you from, now
'Cause we got new shit for y'all
All my niggaz in the spots
Y'all know we tear the shit down and how we hold it nigga
And we come to take shit over y'all
Just because you regulate
And put our foot down, the shop is closin' nigga
Always rep the street for all y'all
Constantly hittin' y'all off with street shit
And keep y'all niggaz open, now
All my niggaz, all my bitches
Whatcha'all gon' do now
(Hah)
Every time we come with that street shit
  (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
For all my motherfuckers
That live in the urban city areas
Only the urban city areas
The ghettos
The neighborhoods where they got, delis, liquor stores
And churches right across the streets from alla that
Yea
Motherfuckers sellin' weed, crack, and all of that shit
On the corner, it ain't the right thing to do
But niggaz is put in the motherfuckin', livin' conditions
They have to do that shit
The street motherfuckers
All y'all survival of the fittest motherfuckers, survive
This is dedicated to y'all
Street shit
