Chorus (Krayzie) 
Aint nuthin changed, everyday 
Aint nuthin changed....(3x) 
Its an everyday thing when you hear tha bucks bang 
Mo thuggstaz always claim 
Stay thug up in this game 
N remain tha same 
So follow me now see (now see) 
Up to tha double glock n 
Hear pistols poppin(poppin) 
buckin them bodies with shots see (shots see)
Everybody get up, get down(4x)  
Aint life a fucked up game without the green  
Gotta have tha dolla bill ya'll 
Dawg i need all my change

Thats why we choose this thugsta music use it smoothly dont abuse it do it
Oh So lovley

Mo money, thuggin 
Foreva we keepin it real and im ready to shoot when i let niggaz know what mo thug is that shit that we roll with tha murda we told ya

Than get stopped, we all thug(yeah) 
Ready to bust on anything 
Shoot em up, shoot em up 
Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
Layzie 
Im wonderin really how many more niggas'll be in a coffin 
Before its my time, imma die right here 
Take losses, not a dime 
Everyday its tha same, n i gotta get mine for tha crime 
My mental be blessin my pistol 
My only utensil for cheddar 
Its on tha level, war 
Whateva my mind is my judge 
Imma kiss or my pleasure with ya 
Like kid come parlay with lay 
All through my hood 
Be back, everything gonna be all good 
Niggas ridin real 
Like i would 
Goin against tha grind 
Its all tha same, its all tha same 
Smokin alotta weed ????? 
No pain, no gain 
You straight up hate, n thats a shame 
How long we'll arrange 
Bang, bang gotta get down for my thang 
Aint nothin ta do ta get out of this game (out of this game) 
You'll try, but you still will see 
You could be 
N roll tham greens of tha earth 
Were religious baby 
Baby tell me whut do you wanna do 
Tell me whut you wanna do 
You wanna ride n smoke with me 
Or i can ride n smoke with you 
Its all cool, its all cool, its all cool
