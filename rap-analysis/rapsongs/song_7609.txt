Speedy, you a fool for this one, nigga
CTE nigga, you already know what it is
21 gun salute, I 22's on my coupe
The Chevy standin' so tall, I'm lookin' down on y'all
That's all I gotta tell you niggas, I do this shit
The ice shine so bright, the kush burn just right
My last time tellin' you niggas, I do this shit
26's inches, honey dew outside, watermelon inside
Boy, that's a sweet ride
She diggi'n me checkin' out my paint job
And I'm diggin' her, tryna get a blow job
And my job's hard, I keep hard work
Yeah it's hard now but it's soft works
You know off white, flacked up, just pale
China white, oil base, talkin' fish scales
S550, yeah, the brand new Benz, bought two the same color
I call 'em Siamese twins, you can't out shine me
Can't out class me, my wrist so shine but my neck so flashy
The Chevy standin' so tall, I'm lookin' down on y'all
That's all I gotta tell you niggas, I do this shit
The ice shine so bright, the kush burn just right
My last time tellin' you niggas, I do this shit
My paper standin' so tall, you know the boy gon' ball
That's all I gotta tell you niggas, I do this shit
The ice shine so bright, the kush burn just right
My last time tellin' you niggas, I do this shit
I'm with a ganga hoes, yeah papa dose
Chevy sittin' on them large pies, call it Dominoes
Or maybe Pizza Hut or even Papi Johns
They was outta Chris, so ordered none
I was like what, call me Lil John
Keep it so clear, I'm fuckin' don
I'm the shit bitch, thats right the fuckin' bomb
200 carats, now that's a fuckin' charm
And this my lucky charm and I ain't talkin' corn flakes
I know Philly niggas and they ain't sellin' cheese stakes
But if yo bread straight, you can get the whole 8
You don't acttin' right, they coming for your whole safe
The Chevy standin' so tall, I'm lookin' down on y'all
That's all I gotta tell you niggas, I do this shit
The ice shine so bright, the kush burn just right
My last time tellin' you niggas, I do this shit
My paper standin' so tall, you know the boy gon' ball
That's all I gotta tell you niggas, I do this shit
The ice shine so bright, the kush burn just right
My last time tellin' you niggas, I do this shit
The brick's rapped up and I'm strapped up
Nigga act up, get capped up
See this big toy, play if you wanna, nigga
Head over here, you just 'round the corner, nigga
I'm a heavy weight, never boxed one round
In and outta state and never lost one pound
Nigga I'm crazy straight, I flip crazy weight
Now I flip the mic and that's crazy
Trap or die, nigga, that's my favorite tune
I'm always in the kitchen, that's my favorite room
And I'm baking mines, call me Duncan Hines
Ran threw a 100 grand, call it a waste of time
The Chevy standin' so tall, I'm lookin' down on y'all
That's all I gotta tell you niggas, I do this shit
The ice shine so bright, the kush burn just right
My last time tellin' you niggas, I do this shit
My paper standin' so tall, you know the boy gon' ball
That's all I gotta tell you niggas, I do this shit
The ice shine so bright, the kush burn just right
My last time tellin' you niggas, I do this shit
