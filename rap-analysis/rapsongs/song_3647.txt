Yeah, word up
Yeah, yo
Bling blung, bling blung
First you see the bling, then you feel the blung
This is the way that the world is run, can't you tell?
Bling blung, rock the bells
Move along, move along, along
This is a newa song, KRS-One the supa strong
Move along before you lose your tongue
Before you lose ya lung, be sure MCs get done
Detour or move along, we teach the young
How many young men hung so we could sing a song?
You need to move along, along, along
The string of injustice stung those that bling 'cause now they blung
Materialism stings and now they stung
You need to move along
Life is like ding, dong, ying, yang
Bing, bang, ping, pong, or ping pong
Any lyrical battle we won
Yes, this a master flow, this how life go on
First you got it then you're gone
So don't get stung 'cause after the bling it's blung
No material thing stays with you long
Bling blung, bling blung
First you see the bling, then you feel the blung
This is the way that the world is run, can't you tell?
Bling blung, rock the bells
Move along, along, we can't get stung
We the one, my melanin stuns right up in the sun
I go and I come, don't mind me, son
I'm just a teacher, them cats shouldn't try me, son
I'm that lively one, I roll with them grimy ones
At the temple you can find me, son
What I bring and sing reflects what I brung
I be rolling, aling off the tongue
You can check them other ones, maybe them younger ones
But I be that eye witness just like Connie Chung
Some burn the paper, some burn the bong
I'm burning rappers, I think you need to move along
Bling blung, bling blung
First you see the bling, then you feel the blung
This is the way that the world is run, can't you tell?
Bling blung, rock the bells
Bling blung, bling blung
First you see the bling, then you feel the blung
This is the way that the world is run, can't you tell?
Bling blung, rock the bells
Move along you little singers
Never linger 'round a rhyme bringer, these rap blingers
I break you off a middle finger
Bell ringa, in your mind a dong dinga
Yo, that's what's wrong with these singas
When they sing all they bring is bling, they dummies
But after the bling aling, aling is blung
Post bling is blung, a new ting, son
I'm rockin' these bells like ding dong
As you can see I got no rings on
'Cause it got nothing to with what springs song
So ding dong, open the door to freedom
Any of my books you should read dum and be strong
Or else you need to move along, along, along
Your lyrics are cow dung
There use to be a TV talent show with a gong
And when the gong gonged you were gone
Yes, I am the lyrical Don, beats for art um
But I am unattched to all of thum
The message of the song is bling blung
Don't get caught up in watcha bought up, be strong
Bling blung, bling blung
First you see the bling, then you feel the blung
This is the way that the world is run, can't you tell?
Bling blung, rock the bells
Bling blung, bling blung
First you see the bling, then you feel the blung
This is the way that the world is run, can't you tell?
Bling blung, rock the bells
