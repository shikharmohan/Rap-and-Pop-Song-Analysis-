Yo Hav' where you was at last night

I came thru nigga, ask P, Yo P!
Watch he'll tell you (Yea Aiight)
Bad bad bitch fought me nigga, i fix all these hollywood bitches you heard me
(ok ok ok man ok)
Chorus-50 Cent]
If you want, you kiss it girl, i wont tell
If you want, we can do it right here, or at the hotel
If you want, at the red light we can start things off right
If you want, hey girl i want what you want
[Verse-Havoc]
Ma i wanna splash on ya Mac lip glass
I wont tell, cant ya kiss it real fast
You got me feenin, you see me feenin
Creamin in my jean thats a good enough reason
Little filatio dont equal to cheatin
Some bitches bite it like they teethin
Probably better off beatin, but for some reason you got me
Breathin all hard and my legs all knocky
Cant eat it right now, promise if you spot me
Give it to you good hardbody
I wanna feel groggy, get these windows foggy girl
G-Unit, I'll write that ass a good refferal
Nah im just playin, pardon the dry humor
If you try it some say it'll even taste like calua
Yea, you got me creamin thats a good enough reason
Not to mention yo ass bleedin
Chorus-50 Cent]
If you want, you kiss it girl, i wont tell
If you want, we can do it right here, or at the hotel
If you want, at the red light we can start things off right
If you want, hey girl i want what you want
[Verse-Prodigy]
Ay girl do you remember me, the same boots and jeans
