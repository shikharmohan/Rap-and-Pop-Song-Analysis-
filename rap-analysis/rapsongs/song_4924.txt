Yeah, one, two, c'mon, yeah, yeah, what?
Nasty Nas, Virgo, L-L-Ludacris, Virgo
Doug Fresh, as we go, somethin' like this
Nas here
Baby girl, won't you come an' hold my hand
Won't you come an' chill out with the Virgo
Hey, girl, just come an' hold my hand
Won't you come an' just chill with the Virgo
We sippin' on Merlot, you ain't got be my girl though
I drop you off at Willoughby an' Myrtle
Smash with the Virgo, ain't got to take your shirt off
You seen me convince your homegirl though
Plus she says her life is too hard
She says that she wanna come an' build with the God
Promise me that she gon' play her part
'Cause what I spit gets straight to her heart
An' she's damn fine, feet hammer time, damn if I mind
Love is the bu-bubblin' back of your waistline
I don't waste time, I gotta get, get on it
Just you an' me, two glasses, sip on patron an'
In the club scene where I met Ms. 'Green Eyes'
She walked by askin' me, "Are you Nas?"
Why? "If you was I'd be totally twi"
What's that? "Totally with it, T.W.I."
Ha, ha, well, here I am, yep, I'm the man
Bartender put a Cosmo in that girl hand
So, here we standin' before I begin
Homegirl made a knot out of the cherry stem
Tongue skills, yeah, I like that, now we on the right track
Straight to my phantom, call Africa Black
Ever since then, she been yappin' a track
Told her friends, now they hollerin' behind her back
Sing
Baby girl, won't you come an' hold my hand
Won't you come an' just chill with the Virgo
Hey, girl, just come an' hold my hand
Won't you come an' chill out with the Virgo
We sippin' on Merlot, you ain't gon be my girl though
I drop you off at Peachtree and Myrtle
Smash with the Virgo, you ain't got to take your shirt off
You seen me convince your homegirl though
Now I was so fresh an' so fly in diamonds
When I stepped up in the club even my eyes was shinin'
Bling, a little cute thing said, "What's yo' name?"
I put my necklace in her face an' told her, "Read the chain"
Ooh ooh, so stuck up, told me, "Shut the fuck up"
Blaow, Ludacris in the house
The needle hit the record, they was playin' this song
All the ladies hit the floor an' it was, eh eh, on
Live forever like fame, let the Leroys dance
While I'm laid back, chillin' in my b-boy stance
Could be a little pop lockin' if your girl's top droppin'
But watch for cockblockin' on my coochie stock options
But later for the ASSDAQ, throw 'em on the fast track
Make 'em swip swap, Nasty NAS pass that
Honey in the black 'cause I'm feelin' her curves
He looked down at what I had an' said, "W-w-word"
Why only serve one when we can serve up two?
Then at the bachelor's pad, doin' what the Virgos do
And these women, so shy but get loud undercover
So we can have sex but I can't be your lover
Sing
Baby girl, won't you come an' hold my hand
Won't you come an' just chill with the Virgo
Baby girl, won't you come an' hold my hand
Won't you come an' chill out the Virgo
We sippin' on Merlot, you ain't gon be my girl though
I drop you off at Two-fifth an' Lexo
Smash with the Virgo, you ain't got to take your shirt off
Seen you convince your homegirl though
They got my voice for the record an' my voice for the beat
Virgo proof, baby, run the streets, so let's go, let's go for the beat
Let's go, it's the Virgo, let's go, Nasty Nas, let's go, Ludacris
And if you don't know, now, you know, Doug Fresh
