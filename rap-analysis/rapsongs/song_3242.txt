Whassup, Whassup?!
Westside !!
Here we go,
Another one, Iceberg, Gangsta Rap 
2006, 8t album, SMG ! 
Time to take you back to the days of old
Six-fo Chevys, big fat go
Out throw the West with the Gangstas rollin'
South Central L.A. : my home
We was out the feeling that hiphop be
We couldn't connect to the New York streets
So we took the bandanas and we tied 'em up
Roll up in the studio and laid it rough !
Ice Cube and them niggaz with the tooth
Shown to motherfucker how to blast a deuce (come on) BLAH !!
Dr Dre, NWA, Eazy-E and Ren fuck what you say
**** * *** for them niggaz up north
ghettoboys we was like "Fuck the law!
Dubcee nigga **** *** we thought you how to gangbang and the Crip dance
HOOK :
This ain't RNB, this is Gangsta Rap,
Bitches get smacked, bustas get jacked,
Front if you want you get lay on your back
It's about guns and drugs and hoes and club
x2
Cypress Hill made a nigga understand
How I could just kill a man?
Long Beach out of the dark came Snoop
Skinny little nigga not scared to shoot
Dogg Pound gangstas Kurrupt and Daz
Sure have the whole Death Row unblast
Kane Tea muthafucka Warren G
Nate Dogg rapping that 213
Don't front muthafucka, don't hate
Compton's Most Wanted, MC Eiht
Throw your sets up niggas like you dont give a damn
Inglewood Mac-10 watch who's kane
HOOK :
x2
So you wanna really know what's real on the mik'
My little homie Pac lost his life
East Coast, West Coast, gun talk rules
Cocaine, big wheels, hoes and juice
Down South Gotti nigga is real (Dirty South)
Gangsta Rap got mass appeal
Little white boys in the 'burbs got heat
A ghetto is a ghetto, and a street is strict !
Eliminate the poverty disease
And we'll start rapping 'bout birds and trees
you can get shot no matter how much fucking cash you got
you can never get away the streets they HOT !
And gangstas ain't the ones to push
They kill ya in a second, ask President Bush!
HOOK
