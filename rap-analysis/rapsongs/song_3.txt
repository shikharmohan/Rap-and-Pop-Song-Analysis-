I know Boo Boo I mean 50 he a grimy nigga
Think he shot my brother I'ma find that nigga
We don't see his punk ass unless he on TV
Yeah, he did my brother dirty but he don't wanna see me
Member Rydell from KP thought he was his man
Put him on the table to bag up he beat him for grams

Yeah, I know Curtis, he used to fuck with my friend
Used to come through my projects pick her up in his Benz
Niggaz from my buildin' always used to ask about him
Like she in and out of town right, that niggaz get down right
I used to say, all I know is the nigga get money
And you standin' in my way, excuse me dummy
Ronda she told me that nigga a freak
And McDonald's ain't the only thing that he eat
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
Everybody runnin' they mouth

I love 50 Cent, that's my dad
But even my mom talks about him bad
She says since he blew up, he changed for sure
He's really fascinated with these fancy hoes
I don't know why but there personalities collide
And my dad will swallow blood before he swallow his pride
You know the kids in my class they be sayin' he crazy
They just like him 'cause he roll with Dr. Dre and Shady
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear niggaz runnin' they mouth
You should hear how they talk about me
Man 50 fucked up, I mean real fucked up
He left us in the hood, we fucked up
I can't believe this nigga gettin' all this money
Still actin' like he in the street tellin' niggaz they can't eat
You know this motherfucker went and bought Tyson's crib
Got Bentley's, Ferrari's and all that shit
He don't even come through to try and help niggaz out
That's the bullshit, see what I'm talkin' about
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
Everybody runnin' they mouth
You should hear how they talk about me
That's my Grand baby, I love him I raised that boy right
He ran to me cryin', I sent him back out to fight
Put a battery in his sock, go pick up a rock
You ain't a chump, you want your Grandma to think you a punk
Look at my first Grand baby, he is a big rap star
Bought me a house, diamonds and a brand new car
I taught him what it takes to go this far
Boy I'm the reason you are what you are
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
Everybody runnin' they mouth
You should hear how they talk about me
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
Everybody runnin' they mouth
