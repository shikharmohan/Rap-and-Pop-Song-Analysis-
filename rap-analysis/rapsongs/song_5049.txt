Where my ladies at? I say where my ladies at?
Let's find somewhere we can go crazy at
And for you baby, I'll be your maniac
Hey, hey, hey, hey
And you don't have to worry about nothin'
'Cause every time I see you, baby you'll be rollin' with me
Oh I'll be on the side lines rootin' for my dime
Holdin' up my sign and it say
Go baby, go baby, go baby, go baby
Go baby, go baby, go baby, go baby
Go baby, go baby, go baby, go baby
Go baby, go baby, go baby, go baby
There my lady at, I say there my lady at
That's my honey, if I giver her money
She ain't gotta pay me back
No you ain't gotta pay me back
Hey, hey, hey, hey
I'll forever give my love
'Cause when I'm down you always put a smile on me
And when all my strengths up and I'm about to give up
And I need a lift up, I'll hear you say
Go baby, go baby, go baby, go baby
Go baby, go baby, go baby, go baby
Go baby, go baby, go baby, go baby
Go baby, go baby, go baby, go baby
She loves me, she loves me more
A more means she's a shore, she adores me
Even when it's up and down like sea-saw
Surely we can start from scratch like default
When they say your not my baby like Maury
You can tell 'em that they tellin' a story
Testify like you're tellin' a jury
And I'll repeat like it you said it before me
We undefeated like a veteran army
And we as heavy as an elephant aren't we?
Let's take 'em to a zoo or better yet a safari
Women let me ding like the fella from Masai
Now we go back like a set of Atari
From baby fat to skeletons darlin'
Me starin' you what it says in the marque
So let's go give 'em a show all my honkers say
Go baby, go baby, go baby, go baby
Go baby, go baby, go baby, go baby
Go baby, go baby, go baby, go baby
Go baby, go baby, go baby, go baby
You're my sure fire, superstar, sure shy
Firecracker, extravaganza, fantastic
Super size, extra cheese, you best believe
You're my sure fire, superstar, sure shy
Firecracker, extravaganza, fantastic
Super size, extra cheese, yes indeed
Where my ladies at? I say where my ladies at?
Let's find somewhere we can go crazy at
And for you baby, I'll be your maniac
Hey, hey, hey, hey
And you don't have to worry about nothin'
'Cause every time I see you, baby you'll be rollin' with me
Oh I'll be on the side lines, rootin' for my dime
Holdin' up my sign and it say
Go baby, go baby, go baby, go baby
Go baby, go baby, go baby, go baby
Go baby, go baby, go baby, go baby
Go baby, go baby, go baby, go baby
