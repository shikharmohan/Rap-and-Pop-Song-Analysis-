Lil Wayne: 
What you feel like doing girl?
(Chorus:)
I feel like fucking too (remix)
I feel like fucking too (remix)
I feel like (ladies) fucking you (I got you)
I feel like (It's your baby) fucking something too 
(Verse 1:)
Well I'm lookin' in my Jacob can't tell the time
I got plenty stones and aint none of them rhine
And I'm looking in her face and I can smell shes mine because she back her apple bottom up on my prime and then the pineapple juice come out fine
She drink it like its kush grape
Say it taste like wine
I could set a fruit plate on her behind
I could get a new date on her behalf
Got a size 2 waste 
with a perfect ass
Baby dog cute face like a cabbage patch
and I smash that ass like Randy savage
wish I could pass that ass to my man in tha parish
Now slam that ass on tha campus 
damn this girl ain't even wearin' no panties
That's grown up
and i'm grown up too
and we could get together do what grown-ups do
Now what you talking bout?
(Chorus:)
I feel like fucking too (It's so good)
I feel like fucking too (damn it's so great)
I feel like fucking you (so don't wait)
I feel like fucking something too 
(x2)
(Verse 2)
So cold I rose my city 
pretty women say I hope he feelin' us (oh)
Boy you killing us so long
My dick is so long
Continuous dope dick
Then I'm so gone 
remember it memories 
kick my feet up and fall back
big back seat my nigga I need all that
Big dog status baby I got necks
I don't even cash my checks I'm a mess
I invest match my neck
Thats a house with a pool in the back
How cool is that? 
Damn baby what move is that?
Damn do that bet Ciara can't do that
Got my Blue era fitted low she raised my hat
You can't do that, you can't stop my fresh
can't handle that 
if you can baby let me know somethin'
I be waitin' over right after show for her
what you talkin' bout?
(Chorus:)
I feel like fucking too (It's so good)
I feel like fucking too (damn it's so great)
I feel like fucking you (so don't wait)
I feel like fucking something too 
(x2)
(Verse 3:)
Enough with the games
hop up in this truck 
we can fuck 
switching lanes
But I'm parking
slap on a rubber
grab her on ya but softly
Push the seat back
look at that let's party
ya, I make ya bust like a baloon
I'm stuck inside of ya womb
From the night to the noon, shit.
But I'm likely to move
And rush right in the room
And fuck like it's a zoo
Yeah, yeah
And I'm a animal 
stroke like clearance do
No I won't handle bulls
You, now raise it up come close
and let me sandwich you
then slow motion and ram it (Oooh)
Yeah, you like the way I murder that shit
On the ride to ya die swing a curv on that dick
Got me hard as a brick
When you do what you do
And now I feel like fucking you
(Chorus:)
I feel like fucking too (It's so good)
I feel like fucking too (damn it's so great)
I feel like fucking you (so don't wait)
I feel like fucking something too 
(x2)
