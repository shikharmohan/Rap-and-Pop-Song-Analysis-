[Intro: Ice-T Talking]
ooohh, that's what I'm talkin' about
Ice Berg, 2006, remember this
[Chorus:]
Go Ice man
Walking in the rain with the people that I love, feels so fine "uha"
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind "yeah"
Walking in the rain with the people that I love, feels so fine "uha"
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind
[Verse 1: Ice-T]
Damn, this record takes me way back, to day that
I said the words I love you, I'm not that kind to say that
I spent my lights in the streets with beef crooks
shook cats get lifted off thier feet with heat
nobody loves, you can feel the cold in thier hugs
at each man checks his weapon that protects his life
and last thing on my mind was ever having a wife
no, I'm not the type to do that, I can't commit to that
but then you stepped to me "Damn"
blew my whole spot up
dropped me to my knees, and I still don't think I got up
ugh, you made me revaluate my G
now I'm gangster for you baby, and you gangster for me
and we're walking......
[Chorus:]
Go Ice man "ugh"
Walking in the rain with the people that I love, feels so fine "you know"
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind "uha"
Walking in the rain with the people that I love, feels so fine "come on girl"
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind
[Verse 2: Ice-T]
the truth is, it ain't easy for a brother from the streets
to ever show an affection or an aim at direction
when we roll, you're by my side, I feel pride
and my partners got no problems cause they know that you're true
and if anything just jumps off I taught just what to do
get low, get the bail money, call up the crew
you take a bullet for me, I'll take a bullet for you
we'll do old, strollin' girl
you know how we do, we're just walking....
[Chorus:]
Go Ice man "ugh"
Walking in the rain with the people that I love, feels so fine "uha"
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind "yeah girl"
Walking in the rain with the people that I love, feels so fine "ugh"
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind
[Break: Ice-T Talking]
Break it down, yeah, you know
it comes in time in every man's life
player hustler or whatever, that he realizes
that he needs that companionship of the women
strong women to hold him down
through them cold nights
through them hard chips, pains and struggles in the streets
stress "go Ice man"
[Verse 3: Ice-T]
realize I've grown in life I had to get shot before I understood
that you come in this world and die alone
don't wanna spend my life chasin' flash and cash
I'd rather whip through the hood with your feet on my dash
the homies understand and they lookin' for girl to thier own
so they can't get out these streets and stay home
it's cold when you got no one, but I've found mine
as long as we together girl I know we'll be fine
cause we're walking.......
[Outro:]
Go Ice man "ugh"
Walking in the rain with the people that I love, feels so fine "come on"
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind "yeah girl"
Walking in the rain with the people that I love, feels so fine "ugh"
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind "we're just"
Walking in the rain with the people that I love, feels so fine "holdin' hands"
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind "holdin' our pistols"
Walking in the rain with the people that I love, feels so fine "grabin' your booty"
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind "yeah baby"
Walking in the rain with the people that I love, feels so fine "come on"
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind
