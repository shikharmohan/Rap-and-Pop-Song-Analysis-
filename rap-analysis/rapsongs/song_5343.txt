My best friend say
She sick of me
Cryin' on the phone
Tellin' how the men are doggin' me
My best friend say
Don't tell her nothin' bout me can you girl
She ain't showin' me no sympathy
My best friend say
If she was me she'd let you
Go long, long time ago
My best friend say, my best friend say
I'll be there
I'll still be there for you
In your time of need
You can lean on me
Come on
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
In your time of need
You can lean on me
Come on
I'll be there for you
My best friend say
I can stay with her
At her house no doubt
Any time I like
My best friend say
Don't let you ruin my life
'Cuz you don't do for me
And you don't act right
My best friend say
If she was me she would let you
Go long long time ago
My best friend say, my best friend say
I'll still be there for you
In your time of need
You can lean on me
Come on
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
In your time of need
You can lean on me
Come on
I'll be there for you
