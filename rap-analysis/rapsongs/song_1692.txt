Spaces and places we fly
Kicks are for places and spaces we fly
Space and all the fat places we fly
Butter, baby to the jet in the cut, dig it
Boogie jive and rap is life where I'm from
Where I'm from, I might play with Izzy where I'm from
Where I'm from, it be like, "Run your coat black"
Jupiter, keeps her fat beats by the pack
Where I'm from, nappy hair is life
We be reading Marx where I'm from
The kids be rockin' Clarks, where I'm from
You turn around your cap, you talk over a beat
And dig some sounds boomin' out a jeep
Where I'm from, cocoons hide the youth, swoon units 100 proof
You want some beef, they will cut you some
Where I'm form, the beats is infinite where I'm from
Voodoo, ashubani, gangsta, lean where I'm from
I'm interplanetary, my insect movements vary
It's kinky if it's hair, G, where I'm from
The fire hoses blow, it's purple wind and snow
I do a hit and go, split
It's hip, what's hip? When hip is just the norm
'Cause Planets pledge allegiance to the funk in all it's forms
The kinks, the dance, the prints in all the shirts
My grandmother told my mother it's Africa at work
On vibes, we freak, them universal beats
You find it at the spot, you hit at ends of every week
We twist, exist to spin the maddest hits
Up here funk is our neighbor, so we paid her a visit
The lip we sip, can't house the nine zips
For rock we can't do nothin', for this we come equipped
Off disc, off tape, rap blastin' till from 8
The really, truly, fat the fly on the flip
Cocoa gotta know, how Planets, gotta roll
Speak the mega cool, get funky as a goal
It's calm, relax, we're only some new jacks
That acts from the funk
But don't play the role
Where you from?
Spaces and places we fly
Pop it to places and spaces we fly
Space and all the hit places we fly, yeah
Money was the haps, underneath my naps, come
Weekend 'Dig Plans', got T's where I'm from
Where I'm from, it's Collins 13 where I'm from
Where I'm from, brothers took the beat and got fly
Why? That's most asked by 85, where I'm from
Fakin' the funk you get did
Projects, tenements, pyramids
Where I'm from, we're livin' off the boom, boom crack
It's that hip hop rockers jazz when I max
Peace be the greeting of the insect tribe
Pestilent forces can't catch the vibe
We live to love and we love to rock mics
We speak in ghetto tongue 'cause ghetto's the life
Food for thought, so get a buffet plate
The lyrics are so fat you might gain weight
So just watch me step alone, into the sunset
Left foot, right foot, 1, 2 mic check
Brewin' funk inside my soul kitchen
So pull up a chair here's a bit have a listen
Of hardhead intervene, damn, I know you're fluent
Yeah, 'cause Doodle ain't havin' it and Butterfly knew it
Where you from?
Spaces and places we fly
Lay it on places and spaces we fly
Space and all the smooth places we fly
Junk for the G rise, Mecca, yeah, you know it's like
Venus acts a fool at the square, right? Yeah
Doctors engineer in apparel, right? Yeah
Hip-Hop made a point last year, right? Yeah
But Planets is the joint this year, right? Yeah
Planets got the dubs and live to grass-hop
Duck out from the fuzz, that sweat the hip-hop
Risin' like we foam, get it from the dome
I'm from where the fat beats stretch for mad blocks
We can get a kit, without no thread
Feelin' funky beats go straight, to the head
Fall into a club, dig on what we love
It be past six, before we reach bed
Butter freaks on relics we say, those are fat
Doodle makin' silk, LaQuan, where it's at?
We need to stack a sack, for rap to take us dap
So we treat our clips, just like, bustin' caps
Rip it 'til dawn, kick it 'til dawn
Hip-Hop is the fix or else we be gone
People thought they canned it, rap is not by bandits
Digable Planets got it, goin' on
Everywhere, every, every where, yeah
Everywhere, every, every where, yeah
Everywhere, every, every where, yeah
Everywhere, every, every where, yeah
Everywhere, every, every where, yeah
Everywhere, every, every where, yeah
Everywhere, every, every where, yeah
Everywhere, every, every where, yeah
