Nigga was born and brought up in Cleveland
Cool quiet just like my daddy
When I was thuggin' out in the alley
With my boys in a stolen caddie
I was shootin' the breeze, blowin' some weed
And every now and then I sip some Hennessey
And after my niggas was bustin' we probably was lookin' for trouble
Uh, oh, here come the po po
Y'all better toss that yayo quick and tuck ya bank roll
Don't think I forgot where I come from dog, 'cuz I know
Cleveland, Ohio fo' sho' where we slung dope in the snow
I'm from the streets the streets of Cleveland
It's mandatory you need it
'Cuz niggas'll catch ya slippin'
And niggas'll leave ya bleedin'
Fuck what they said about Bone catch us anywhere
Grab a couple of my St. Claire niggas take us anywhere
We don't care, handle that and take care of that
If it goes like that then it goes like that  it's Cleveland
Its mandatory to leave these niggas bleedin'
And you could neva hate against Bone
You wrong, you know we brung it on so strong
We get 'em, split 'em, we hit 'em
And Bone been the shit since I could remember
Before most of these niggas even thought about rap
We was screamin' out no surrender
With a gat in the hand runnin' wild in the land
With a pocket full of boulders
Po po, know they can't hold us
When they east dog comin' from the shoulders
And the older niggas they told us
You gotta get down fo' yo hustle
Got glocks to show you this muscle
Get the money, little nigga, don't struggle
That's no bitch nigga that's the rules
All my Cleveland niggas said to me
They're the ones that gave this game to me
I'ma push this shed to the head ya see
Ya better believe Syann, I be scared when I was there
Nigga you know I ain't goin' nowhere
Your mother was my mother
Ya brotha is right here
In the Columbus but they loved me not
When I went to Cleveland they said where you been
When I'm unconditional with my loving
And at the C L E V E L A N D
And we get bucked on the block, block, block, block
And nigga remember I said weed this for we
And all them niggas that love me down in Columbus
Nigga Cleveland Rocks
