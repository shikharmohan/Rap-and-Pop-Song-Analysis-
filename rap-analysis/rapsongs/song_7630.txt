And you know, chea, and you know
Chea, get the money, get the money
And you know, and you know, and you know
Young, yeah, I see you, nigga, let's go
I hear y'all talk that work shit, that's cool
That don't mean shit, I don't know you
I don't know you, I don't know you
I don't know you, I don't know you
I hear y'all talk that work shit, that's cool
That don't mean shit, I don't know you
I don't know you, I don't know you
I don't know you, I don't know you
Feelin' is in this shit, that's right I'm in this bitch
Y'all niggas acting like Young ain't never did this shit
Nigga, five hundred grams, rock solid, no shake
Call them thangs Chappelles, he wants his other half baked
You know I like to scramble mine, Waffle House style
Or leave 'em sunny side up and let 'em chill for a while
Not only have I done it, I did it, I lived it
Delivered it myself, yeah, I'm making house visits
I'm praying while I'm driving, it's making me religious
In the headlights behind me, it's making me suspicious
And maybe I'm trippin' and maybe I'm not
Maybe it's nothing, just hope it ain't the cops, okay
I hear y'all talk that work shit, that's cool
That don't mean shit, I don't know you
I don't know you, I don't know you
I don't know you, I don't know you
I hear y'all talk that work shit, that's cool
That don't mean shit, I don't know you
I don't know you, I don't know you
I don't know you, I don't know you
I go there, get that and go back with that
And then I flip that, then send that right back
If it got two bags, it must be five stacks
So you owe five stacks, bring that right back
If it take too long, must be rerock
Two in the shoe box, nah, these ain't Reeboks
I don't live there, I just cook there
Ain't nothing in there but fish and cookware
Can't drop our shit, work that fork though
Lock up like woah, Young like fo' sho'
This shit right here, call that, come back
Drop this nine off and I'll be right back
I hear y'all talk that work shit, that's cool
That don't mean shit, I don't know you
I don't know you, I don't know you
I don't know you, I don't know you
I hear y'all talk that work shit, that's cool
That don't mean shit, I don't know you
I don't know you, I don't know you
I don't know you, I don't know you
I don't know why these niggas tell lies
Y'all know damn well he ain't flippin' no pies
All this bird talk make me want some Popeyes
Y'all getting no play off in my rides
Fake ass niggas, how dare you compare Young?
Black Crown Vic, yeah that used to scare Young
My six-two's come back like Frisbees
All these smoke fumes got me dizzy
They talk bricks see, I'm just listening
Say I'm just listening
Hook might be tight but that don't sound right
I sold Snow White and he sold no white
I hear y'all talk that work shit, that's cool
But that don't mean shit, I don't know you
I don't know you, I don't know you
I don't know you, I don't know you
I hear y'all talk that work shit, that's cool
That don't mean shit, I don't know you
I don't know you, I don't know you
I don't know you, I don't know you
Chea, and you know
I ain't bouncing for none of you, niggas, nigga
And you know
I ain't cosigning none of you fake ass, niggas
Realest nigga in the BS nigga, Jezzy
And you know, and you know

And you know

I hear y'all talk that work shit, that's cool
That don't mean shit, I don't know you
I don't know you, I don't know you
I don't know you, I don't know you
