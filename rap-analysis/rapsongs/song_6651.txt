Now this side, gangsta walk
(Say what?)
And this is how gangsta's talk
(Like that?)
Tell 'em how we do, tell 'em what we do
This is what we do nigga, gangsta's talk
Tell 'em one more time, gangsta talk
All the homies in the hood, gangsta talk
To my nigga Eastwood, gangsta talk
Kurupt and Daz, gangsta talk
Gangsta's ride, uhh, do what gangsta's do
Bandanna hangin' from the rear view
Too smart, know them up, hold 'em up
(Though)
We could go head up and I'll fold 'em up slow
There's a gangsta loose, callin' all cars
Just left the house in some blue Allstars
Passin' by on them thang, it's a brown MC
Niggaz goin' buffin' DPG
(Dogg Pound, Dogg Pound)
Niggaz mad Dogg bumpin' a bank account
(Wood)
But I don't recognize the busta
So I hit up the hood, wit one hand on the heater
The other in the air, Dogg Pound gangsta's yo, we don't care
I gots to watch myself especially my health, before anything else
My life, my wealth, I'ma G and I do what gangsta's do
And they do it like me and my G, Tray Deee
Bitch talkin' shit, huffin' a dip
Call up my niggaz and say, "Yo, don't even trip"
DAZ and my nigga Kurupt
Came through and a MC scooped me up
Aiiyo, I got the [unverified] I usually does
Young Gotti in the back seat fucked up cous'
Man it's ashame how my gang, gang bang
No disrespect but, hey, we want thangs
In the [unverified]  let's see what quest [unverified] seas
Eightball slippin', Dogg Pound trippin'
Back in the mo', where we don't give a fuck
My baby, brother NYA, and just he got stuck
By them same motherfuckers who supposed to be killin' me
Peelin' me, and ya niggaz ain't feelin' me
Bad news, seem to travel fast
When you on the mask, and all about'cha cash
All my niggaz in the [unverified] gangsta talk
And all my homies sippin' Hen', gangsta talk
If ya can't get out, and you mad as hell
Say, "Biatch," that'll make ya sound for real
Ha ha, fuck wit' us we, gon' hurt somebody
Fuck wit' us we, gon' hurt somebody
Only gone, Dillinger, Young Gotti
Fuck wit' us we, gon' hurt somebody
Cha-pow, layin' all these wack niggaz down
Churned out, blowned out, work high, hell
Whattup [unverified] I see my niggaz all in the cut
Layed back, actin' a nut, waitin' 'till we 'rupt
No remorse, as we bust, let her feel the dust
Let 'em do what we gotta do, fuckin' shit up
Let it be known, Daz Dillinger, rough to the bone
And all alone through ya neighborhood at high exhaust
High stylin' and profilin', niggaz comin' after me
In actuality they face the technicality
Let 'em feel the battle, it was a tragedy
Everywhere a nigga die for the salary
Pray to God, pray to Lord, watch after me
Prepare the back sniff streets mentality
It's the gang and we mad and we walk and we stalk
And we do what we do after dark
Niggaz keep doin' what the fuck they gotta do
And we do what we do when we mash wit our crew bitch
(Ssh)
Dillinger, willin' ya and killin' ya
Doin' what I gotta do, it's blood that I'm spillin' ya
(Yeah)
All over your floor, tell the fat guy, "Ignore"
Break down your door and let kick ya one more
Gangsta, strait out
(Bitch)
To the flat like that like what, like this, like what
(Like this, like that)
Now this is how gangsta's walk
And this is how gangsta's talk
