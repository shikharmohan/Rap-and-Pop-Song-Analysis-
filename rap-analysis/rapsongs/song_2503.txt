Mm-hmm, hold me down, hold me down, hold me down
Ah yeah yeah hold me down, yeah, hold me down
Word up, ye-yeah, a-yeh, to hold me down, hold me down
Word to, everybody that, hold me down, yo, what?
Aiyyo P back me up now, hold me down
While I go around this town, snatchin' crowns
From those supposed, wannabe rap vocalists
If you nice get your rope and dosey-do in this
Let me know somethin' you wanna fight?  Let's go somethin'
If not, close your mouth and say nothing
Y'all imitations, fuckin' up the whole situation
With sucker MC infiltration
Aiyyo straight up, you light MC's better get your weight up
I'm benchin' three hundred and change, starvin cats get ate up
Ain't that ill?  How I can just stare and watch the blood spill
From an unknown rapper but now the rapper's no thrill
Now how real is that?  Burnin' gats, knifes and bats
Hot rhyme, status, with the hot wax
Mixed with the street slang is where it's at
Perhaps, you should close your mouth kid and slide back
Yo E, hold me down
I'm holdin' you down
Yo P, hold me down
I'm holdin' you down
Yo E, hold me down
I'm holdin' you down
PMD, hold me down
I'm holdin' you down
Yo E, hold me down
I'm holdin' you down
PMD, hold me down
I'm holdin' you down
Yo E, hold me down
I'm holdin' you down
PMD, hold me down
I'm holdin' you down
You got shit harder than this, Erick Serm' and Parrish Smith?
What's this?  Piped out five, with the kit?
And millions to back it, keep it rugged never wack kid
This ain't just rhymin', God's on the way and he's askin'
Who's been followin' the rules, two noided, so we strap tools
And can't cool, this go out to the cats in school
It's not the norm, word bond, so get ready for the rainstorm
Too hot, fuck lukewarm, when we swarm
Yeah we swarm Mc's with the bee effect, zzzzz, sting 'em
Like Muhammad, set the scene I'm bombin' on CEO's, A&R;'s
Street team to a manager for the cream, we damage ya
On light-skinned, dark-skinned, albino, from a crackhead
Dopefiend , or wino, bring the Ultra-ment, stick you with the Magnetic
Give a shout, to them sweet cats, rap diabetics
Yo P, hold me down
I'm holdin' you down
Yo E, hold me down
I'm holdin' you down
Yo PMD, hold me down
I'm holdin' you down
Yo E, hold me down
I'm holdin' you down
Yo PMD, hold me down
I'm holdin' you down
E-Dub, hold me down
I'm holdin' you down
Mic Doc, hold me down
I'm holdin' you down
Green Eyed Bandit, holdin' it down
Yeah, I'm holdin' you down
Niggaz tryin' to jam the frequency, when on the low
They be peepin' me and the E, DJ Scratch, EPMD
The Dream Team, who fiend for the cream since sixteen
Dodgin' po-nine and marks, with the high beams
God-body, rap style, Mazerrati catchin' bodies
E Double holdin' shit down with the sawed off shotty
What you thought?  We takin' more than nickels and shorts?
Get the fuck out of here, nothin' sweet here, you get your shit torched
I spit flames at Oklahoma when done, you can smell the Sermon aroma
In a coma, burned to death, man listen, did he deserve
The kicked to the curb, ass whippin'? Believe you me, it was his destiny
For the child to end for fuckin' with men
P and I got somethin' for all y'all who stand tall
And dose dat like to ball, so we ball like Spalding
In the time of need who you calling when your career is falling?
Way down, you've been hit, lay down, hit the ground
Don't get up, stay down, relax a minute, you shouldn'ta
Put your two cents in it now you up a creek
In the back of a car that's rented
