I be that nigga named ludi
A K A  L O V A  L O V A
Fuck that shit
Nigga what you wan say one time
Southside let's ride
And if you love what you do, do what you feel
Then I know you gonna mark my words
Y'all drop shit like birds
Then it's about the time for yo ass to get served
Just lay it on down, just lay it on down
While we relax to the tight raps
And the phat tracks
That that nigga Timbaland put down
Oh yes, let's get it on down to the nitty grit
Don't have no time for the patient
'Cuz I got more dick than a lil' bit
And time flies, when I'm havin' fun
I can make a hoe get like Forest Gump and just run baby run
I guess that they can't handle this
The brothers just too scandalous
If you don't wanna get freaked
Get up out my way just like an ambulance
Gitty up gitty, up ride up on the real, let death to the fake
And tell your boyfriend just to chill, don't playa hate
Kick back relax and just take off yo shoes
'Cuz I gotta tell you what I wants to do, yea
Let me touch it
Let me feel it
Let me grab it
That fat rabbit
Let me touch it
Let me feel it
Let me grab it
That fat rabbit
Let me touch it
Let me feel it
Let me grab it
Fat rabbit
Let me touch it
Let me feel it
Let me grab it
That that fat rabbit
Fatter than fat facts like a dove sack
Showin' them where that love's at
So open up your eyes
And get a surprise like in crackerjacks
Punan' Don happy
Givin' up that nappy dug out
Get the cut up, then I cut out
Why you standin' there wit yo' butt out
And it's always in the back of my mind
Whatever the place, whatever the time
Even in College Park, after dark, I'ma get my sunshine
Closer than close, closer than most, then I'm all up in ya
The beginners, give me a thigh, breast, and wing like Ms. Winner
And let dinner be served
Can I get it on a platter? Shatter your bladder
And put so much light in yo' life
I'll make the roaches scatter
The wetta the betta, I'm ready to get ya
Gotta have rabbit like that cheddar
So I can freak you like I just met ya
Hot like a sauna, get comfy like in a Cadillac
Nick nack paddy wack give a dog a bone Jack
Kick back relax and just take off yo' shoes
'Cuz I gotta tell you what I wants to do, yea
Let me touch it
Let me feel it
Let me grab it
That fat rabbit
Let me touch it
Let me feel it
Let me grab it
That fat rabbit
Let me touch it
Let me feel it girl
Let me grab it girl
Fat rabbit girl
Let me touch it
Let me feel it girl
Let me grab it
That fat rabbit girl
Yo' love is supa-cala-fragalistic
You don't know how bad I missed it
If it broke then don't fix it, yo' stuff is butta like a biscuit
Reminisce like Mary, I gotta pop that cherry
Kinda like that coochie, you wanna be my hoochie
Better than my adversary
Don't be so scary, I never thought that you could act up
Make a nigga wanna back up
Keep it tight through the night while I wet this track up
So we can slip and slide make you wanna dip and dive
Trippin' while we rip and ride
'Til I get to the coming side got you where I want yo' ass
In the case of an emergency, break the glass
Keep yo' eyes on the President, erase the past
And be happy if we had more blunts to pass
Get done up and run up
And the guts of yo' butt don't shake like they used to
I wake 'em up like a rooster
Take it slow, not faster than a turbo rooster
No worry, no hurry, no pain, no gain
You better keep yo' eyes on strain
'Cuz ain't a damn thing changed, may
Kick back, relax and take off yo' shoes
'Cuz I gotta tell you what I wants to do, yea
Let me touch it
Let me feel it
Let me grab it
That fat rabbit girl
Let me touch it
Let me feel it girl
Let me grab it
That that rabbit girl
Let me touch it
Let me feel it girl
Let me grab it
That fat rabbit girl
Let me touch it
Let me feel it girl
Let me grab it
That
Let me touch it, let me touch it
Let me feel it, let me feel it
Let me grab it, let me grab it
Fat rabbit, fat rabbit
Let me touch it, let me touch it
Let me feel it, let me feel it
Let me grab it, let me grab it
Fat rabbit, fat rabbit
Let me touch it, let me touch it
Let me feel it, let me feel it
Let me grab it, let me grab it
Fat rabbit, fat rabbit
Let me touch it, let me touch it
Let me feel it, let me feel it
Let me grab it, let me grab it
Fat rabbit, fat rabbit
