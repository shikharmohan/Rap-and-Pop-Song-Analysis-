That's right, want time for your mind?
It sad for you all my niggaz who think they hard
Ok nigga, I'll tell you what's hard up yo, whats hard up yo?
Goin' about your day nigga losin' your life at the end of it
Nigga that's what's hard, minding my motherfuckin' business
Let me tell ya'll 'bout the last day I lived in my life
I'm in the 96 Impala with the gat in my lap
Annihilating any nigga tryin' to work in my trap
I have the Feds got me tapped so to keep em' off of my back
I got a crib in the trap and a crib to relax
Now my indictment was a secret
And that's the way that they keep it
If I ain't have a hoe givin' head to the feds
Comin' back tellin' me exactly what they said
I'm a dead man walkin', waitin' on time in jail
But I'll die before I let 'em stop my mail
Long as I got another ounce to sell
What the hell I'm a bail, a grab my scale
Get another key and I'm a slang my ya
Every day I feel like he on my trail
Look 'em in the face and say fuck their jail
Niggaz on the west side cant re-up because it's a drought
So I check the crack house, damn it sold out
Now back to the crib so I can check this stash
Ain't sure about how much dope I had
Got a couple keys in the safe right now
Weigh it up, cook it up, then chop it down
Now I'm ready to go and pick up my fetti
But before I leave the house I can't dip without grabbin' my G'z
And my keys to my brand new V
Put 'em in pocket so I'm a get blue jeans
[Incomprehensible] nigga you had 'bout three
Put this red dot to your ass an' squeeze
Now I'm dippin' back to the swats, with the 4-4 and a plastic glock
Turned around and I had to stop, couldn't trap sworn it was cops
Sittin' white but I still ain't scared, Mac Boney 'em must have fled
Only cops is I fear is the feds on my car flashin' blue an' red
Damn there they go now it's time to deal
Got the 4-4 right by my heal
9 millimeter with a extra clip
That's what ya'll niggaz get fuckin' 'round with TIP
Bustin' at 'em an' cursin' at 'em but ain't no shakin' 'em
Them bullets that they was bustin' at me my vest was takin'
Makin' them pigs fall in pain, turned around 'cause one call my name
Took a hot one to the brain, yeah I died but long live the game
