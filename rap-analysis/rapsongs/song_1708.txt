Yeah well, we're back with another one
Comin' hard and got suckers on the run
You say, you guys are known for havin' fun
Yeah well, we'll do what has to be done for us to be number one
And you ain't never heard nuthin' this funky, son
You ain't never heard nuthin' this funky ever, it's too clever
Rhyme goes through your mind
Like a guillotine severs the head, my friend
And you will never hear nobody rap like this again
You ain't heard nuttin' this funky, brother, it's like no other
You feel the bass bouncin' off the walls like rubber
The Real McCoy, this ain't no toy or another
How do we do it? Yo, go ask your mother
The freak need us, beat leaders
Let me tell you somethin'
You ain't heard nuttin this funky, Peter
So listen up as we begin, aiyyo Fuze, rub the record in
'Cause you ain't heard nuttin' this funky
'Cause you ain't heard nuttin' this funky
'Cause you ain't heard nuttin' this funky
'Cause you ain't heard nuttin' this funky
The definition of a rhyme breeder, beat needer
We're the cold party heaters
Comin' through the woofers and the tweeters
Funky dope MC leaders rhyme hungry hip-hop listener feeders
The definition of a rhyme sayer, beat layer
Mothersucker perpetrator slayer, layin' down the law like the Mayor
You're out of luck, Hucklebuck, I'll suck you up like a now or later
You say that you're a trooper, then I'm Darth Vader
You're a Cowboy then I'm a Raider
You can't compete 'cause you're incomplete, need to be completed
You're style is weak, you're obsolete, need to be deleted
Short on the things that you needed
So what you got a top ten song 'cause you cheated
If you worked in a kitchen, it'd be sweeter
From the rappin' that I hear, you'd make a better egg beater
A teeter totter or should I say, totter teeter
You're through, you're a court and we're leaders
We got the style you admire, the rhymes you desire
Well, you ain't heard nuttin' this slick you trick
'Cause you're a flick from a Bic and we're a bonfire
'Cause you ain't heard nuttin' this funky, yeah
'Cause you ain't heard nuttin' this funky
'Cause you ain't heard nuttin' this funky
You ain't heard nuttin' this funky
'Cause I roll up fast like a cheetah, get out the two-seater
Walk up on a girl named Anita or Rita
Ask her for change to put money in the meter
Didn't really need it just a smooth way to meet her
Or a fly way to treat her
She said, "I'm hungry" so I took her out to feed her
She was a pocket feeder chicken, fajita pita eater
I said, "Yo, eat how ya like" then took her home and G'd her
The definition of a funky rhyme master
Cleverly put together but not necessarily sayin' it faster
Ya see, that style isn't hard at all
The object of the game is to have a ball y'all
And to see who can come the funkiest
Lot of MC's think it's just a speed contest
They wanna brag about the neighborhood, oh you wanna boast?
We come from different cities and we're coast to coast, ya see
But right now we're based in Oakland
(Oakland)
Everywhere we go we leave the microphone smokin'
Yo bro I'm not jokin'
Leave MC's standin' still with their mouths hangin' open
Walk offstage and leave the next act
Scratchin' his head like a monkey
'Cause you ain't heard nuttin' this funky
'Cause you ain't heard nuttin' this funky
'Cause you ain't heard nuttin' this funky
'Cause you ain't heard nuttin' this funky
Leave a sucker standin' still confused
'Cause he never heard nuttin' this funky
You ain't heard nuttin' this funky
Ah, yeah
Why don't you tell 'em Hump
'Cause you ain't heard nuttin' this funky
Whassup y'all, Humpty Hump in the house
'Cause you ain't heard nuttin' this funky
Yeah
You know what?
You ain't heard nuttin' this funky
Let me bust a rhyme, c'mon
Get in
You ain't heard nuttin' this funky son, we're number one
Humpty Hump in the house, gonna show you how it's done
With professional rhymes, I gotta question for your mind
Have you ever heard anythin' this funky, son?
Yeah man, I was out on the street
These guys came on by in this, car man playin' some beat
You ain't heard nuttin' this funky nigga, how ya figure?
My mouth's on the mic like a finger on a trigger nigga
And when I squeeze I'ma getcha
You never heard nuthin' this funky now didja
And if you're large, we're bigger
You bust a weak ass rhyme and then expect me to dig ya
Humpty Hump's in the house with the locals
Yo, Schmoove kick the vocals
