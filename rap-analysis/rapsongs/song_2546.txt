Real thug hide his money in his mattress

Freaks out, baby mother sneaking out

Thorough chick tell a nigga pile it on 
Bitches what they call us?

Nigga look good, nigga got it all 
Can help but to speak ("Damn daddy how ya doing?") 
Babygirl grew up, mommy ain't around 
Searchin' for a thug in the club to hold me down, ughh

Shit yes I did, moving right along 
Gotta get back before they play the last song 
(Last call for alcohol) 
Damn I knew it 
Thirty minutes till it's over, better do it 
One more drink, one more dance 
Papi staring at me in the corner you got one more chance 
Gotta eat, head to the diner

(Try and find her) 
Repeat 1 (2x)
