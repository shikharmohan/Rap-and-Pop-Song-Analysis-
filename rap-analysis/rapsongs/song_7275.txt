Y'all niggaz really thought we wasn't goin' to do it again
Come on man, grand Hustle nigga, you know what it is
T.I.P, DJ the fuck Drama, Young Dro, Young Buck
I said P and C what's happenin' nigga
I'ma pimp type, nigga ridin' clean after midnight
Ready for the gun play, prepared for a fist fight
Roll up on yo bitch and ask her what that pussy hit like
First she acting funny, in a minute she gon' get right
Get down, got her fuckin' with another bitch now
I'm king of all that I survey, remember this is T.I.P. town
Hey, you ain't ready pussy nigga better sit it down
We Mac-90, rock steady nigga spit rounds
Turn yo stomach to spaghetti when it hit the ground
Toss the choppers in the Chevy than we mashing down
Camelton counting all yo Benjamin's and Hamilton's
As far I'm concerned you just a job for the janitors
Don't disregard I'ma God you a amateur
Hide behind ya bodyguards and ya manager
I pimp hard throughout all the pages and calendar
Bitch it's Pimp Squad all action no cameras
You know what it is, you know what it do
And you know what it is, and you know what it do
You know what it is, you know what it do
And you know what it is, and you know what it do
Shorty we bury niggaz, shorty we bury niggaz
Shorty we bury niggaz, shorty we bury niggaz
The undertaker
You know what it is, you know what it do
And you know what it is, and you know what it do
You know what it is, you know what it do
And you know what it is, and you know what it do
Shorty we bury niggaz, shorty we bury niggaz
Shorty we bury niggaz, shorty we bury niggaz
The undertaker
Hey, stand in on the trap with me
Mashin' me is blasphemy, 1000 round magazine
My partnas say no attackin' me
I'm aged to the average beef, respiratory flamin' beats
Fruit Chevy H.I.C, my lyrics hit like HIV
Spray by me, Sniper Dro, murder come today by me
Bullet chip yo L I P and dirty all yo H I Ps
Shot both of yo homies, now they feedin' them through a I.V.
The tray I be from the west side, where they say I be
May I be the ruler over all that I survey I be
Laid back, yaze black, triple kiwi Maybach
Weed match the Benz, kush triple kiwi 80 pack
Old school baby crack I'm tryin' to bring the 80's back
Haitians get me Haiti crack, plus my momma hated crack
'Til we got a evicted and I came through with them 80 stacks
Play it back, rewind where I live, I'ma zone three hustla
Niggaz know what it is
You know what it is, you know what it do
And you know what it is, and you know what it do
You know what it is, you know what it do
And you know what it is, and you know what it do
Shorty we bury niggaz, shorty we bury niggaz
Shorty we bury niggaz, shorty we bury niggaz
The undertaker
You know what it is, you know what it do
And you know what it is, and you know what it do
You know what it is, you know what it do
And you know what it is, and you know what it do
Shorty we bury niggaz, shorty we bury niggaz
Shorty we bury niggaz, shorty we bury niggaz
The undertaker
May we all bow our heads and pray for this nigga
The undertaker's comin' any day for this nigga
They hate him in the hood, for the dreams he been sellin'
I read the paperwork and it seems you was tellin'
You know what it is and you know who I'm talkin' bout
When the feds came, I didn't open up my mouth
What you scared fo', niggaz know you been a ho
It's like, homies shit was all good just a week ago
Get the goons ready, start up your vehicle
And shoot at any fuckin' car you ain't seen before
Pick up the shells and then use a automatic
They gave 50 years to my nigga Lil' Travis
Set a boobie-trap, let him trip over the wire
Then he gon' be laying, right by the preacher and the choir
And before I do, T.I. go and handle yo biz
When you see me holla at me homie, you know what it is
You know what it is, you know what it do
And you know what it is, and you know what it do
You know what it is, you know what it do
And you know what it is, and you know what it do
Shorty we bury niggaz, shorty we bury niggaz
Shorty we bury niggaz, shorty we bury niggaz
The undertaker
You know what it is, you know what it do
And you know what it is, and you know what it do
You know what it is, you know what it do
And you know what it is, and you know what it do
Shorty we bury niggaz, shorty we bury niggaz
Shorty we bury niggaz, shorty we bury niggaz
The undertaker, oh
