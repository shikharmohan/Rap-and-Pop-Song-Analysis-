Hey wassup Cube?
Man, I'm glad I caught you at your momma' house homey
Wassup man? You still got your pager right or you lost it?
  (It's the curse, the curse)
Y'know my code right? I been pagin' you for about a week man
  (The curse, the curse)
I heard about the deal ya got
(The curse, the curse)
Greed, Khop
(The curse, the curse)
Check this out, you owe a nigga somethin' man
Do the math baby, do the math, Ch-ching
Do the math baby, do the math, Ch-ching
Do the math baby
(The curse, the curse)
Do the math baby
(The curse, the curse)
It's the curse of money, once you get it, fool you got it
Buy a new pair of drawers and motherfuckers spot it
(The curse, the curse)
Niggas plotted, to have me knotted up in basements
Till these cocksuckers see what they're faced with
(The curse, the curse)
Their fantasies of a life stress-free
Full of orgies, in the Florida Keys
(The curse, the curse)
But this bullshit is so thick, it's like mountains
Sick of threatenin' all my lawyers and accountants
(The curse, the curse)
The decibels, gold diggers goin' for the testicles
Soon they realize, I don't invest in hoes
(The curse, the curse)
Sometimes it's like hell on earth
When everybody tryin' to get your ass for all your worth
It's the curse
The curse, the curse
(Do the math baby)
The curse, the curse
(Do the math baby)
The curse, the curse
(Do the math baby)
The curse, the curse
(Do the math )
When you hot, they think you got more than you got
(The curse, the curse)
When you not, motherfuckers callin' you a flop
(The curse, the curse)
I just laugh, the curse everybody wanna have
Before you sell your soul better do the math
I start to scream shit like, "Mayday, Mayday"
'Cause motherfuckers think it's all grav-ay wit my pay day
(The curse, the curse)
And like I said, it's the curse of money
They start laughin' at your jokes when they ain't that funny
(The curse, the curse)
See this ass kissin' yes man
Shakin' hands with the left hand, get my weap-an, get to stepp-an
(The curse, the curse)
Fuck every phony ass nigga round me
Stick a shaft up your ass like Richie Roundtree
(The curse, the curse)
Got to have some gas money if you goin'
If not who you fuckin'? Who you flowin'? Who you owin'?
(The curse, the curse)
In '98 don't shit come free
Not even hard rhymes that's describin' these hard times
The curse, the curse
(Do the math baby, do it)
The curse, the curse
(Do the math baby)
The curse, the curse
(Do the math baby)
The curse, the curse
(Do the math baby)
When you hot, they think you got more than you got
(The curse, the curse)
When you not, motherfuckers callin' you a flop
(The curse, the curse)
I just laugh, the curse everybody wanna have
Before you sell your soul better do the math
To relax I smoke a stick, the shit make me sick
Gotta gang of new homies and relatives on my dick
(The curse, the curse)
No time for drama, busters get sprayed
Bitches wanna get layed and everybody need their bills paid, everybody
(The curse, the curse)
Motherfuckers, sweat me like a spy
They wanna kick it 'cause I, got the curse of Mulah
(The curse, the curse)
Make me wanna start scrappin' and look at me to make it happen
What the fuck was they doin' before Mack 10 was rappin', tell me?
(The curse, the curse)
What the fuck? How can I remain a man of seven figures
When I'm rushed by gold diggers every time I get bigger? Ch-ching
(The curse, the curse)
Like David Banner, when I tweak I turn green
And every time I'm seen it's like people start to fiend
It's the curse
The curse, the curse
(Do the math baby)
The curse, the curse
(Do the math baby, 1 million, 2 million)
The curse, the curse
(Do the math baby, 3 million)
The curse, the curse
(Do the math)
When you hot, they think you got more than you got, yeah they do
(The curse)
When you not, motherfuckers callin' you a flop, motherfuckers
(The curse, the curse)
I just laugh, the curse everybody wanna have
Before you sell your soul better do the math, better do it
The curse, the curse
(Do the math baby, get the fuck outta here)
The curse, the curse
(Do the math baby, with dollar signs in your eyes)
The curse, the curse
(Do the math baby, ha ha, sheeit)
The curse, the curse
(Do the math)
Leave your ass broke
Rabbit ears, nigga for pockets
I'm cursed but I love it
