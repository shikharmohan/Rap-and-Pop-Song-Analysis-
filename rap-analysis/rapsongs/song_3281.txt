Oh yeah
I'm back motherfucker, Ice-T 1991 fool
Told you, you should've killed me last year
Once again I'm back in the place to be
The I, the C, the E, the T
I'll never get a Grammy, so fuck the G
All I need is crowd, and my M I C
Got a gangster ass D.J. named Evil E
My record label's called Warner B
William Morris is my agency
I'll never go broke, I got property
Got a dope Pitbull named Felony
Got four gold albums,  so what you tell'n me?
Power was two, Iceberg was three
This one here shipped five hundred G
Now when I roll, I roll stupid deep
Benz's, Beamers, and boomin' Jeeps
I'm always strapped, 'cause my money I keep
You move on the Ice, and you're goin' to sleep
So when you see me, walkin' down the street
You say, "What's up Ice?" And I say, "Peace!"
You give me a dap, I give you one back
'Cause I ain't souped, so forget about that
We might take a pictures, sign a autograph
Kick a little flavor, have some fun and laugh
But step to me wrong, you might get shot
And wind up lookin' outta ziplock
