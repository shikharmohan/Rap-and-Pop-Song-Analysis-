Oh, I don't know
And it makes me scared
Because I'm falling in love
And I don't know if you feel the same
I'm taking this time to write you this letter
'Cause what we got is good but want to make it better, yo boo
I'm digging you, you got all of the equipment
Now I'm ready for a commitment
I'm not trying to rush things not looking for an engagement ring
But the queen needs a king
And I choose you, 'cause what we got is in tune
Since you promised me the moon I hope to see it soon
I want make this official man, I miss you
I feel for your touch and your kiss too
Listen I hope I'm not being to blunt
Don't wanna scare you away, it's a game I want to play but
Oh, I don't know
And it makes me scared
Because I'm falling in love
And I don't know if you feel the same
Oh, I don't know
(I don't know)
And it makes me scared
(So scared)
Because I'm falling in love
(Falling in love)
And I don't know if you feel the same
(Falling in love, hey)
I know you love it when I call you big poppa  my thoughts are pure
I heard you left your last 'cause she was insecure
I'm not trying to compare myself but I got health and wealth
And now you dealing with the top shelf
My orgasmic thoughts need support
Thinking of positions you taught while I stare at the gifts you bought
The things you do for me make you my number one
When you're around I have a lot of fun check me now
Like the time we went to six flags boosting, tearing off tags
And sticking souvenirs into our bags
Slipped up, almost got caught then tried again
You're more than a lover your my best friend
Do you remember the first time I letcha get it
I was nervous you were too but wouldn't admit it
You were the best I had that's why I want all of you
Now tell them hookers to stop calling you
I'm dead up I want to wear your name
So I pray and ask God to make you feel the same
Oh, I don't know
(Don't know)
And it makes me scared
(It makes me so scared)
Because I'm falling in love
(I'm falling in love again, again)
And I don't know if you feel the same
(Baby baby baby baby)
Oh, I don't know
(I don't know)
And it makes me scared
(I'm makes me scared)
Because I'm falling in love
(I'm falling in love again)
And I don't know if you feel the same
(Oh yeah)
Is there a place to ease my mind
(Place to ease my mind)
Think about you all the time, yeah
Show me a sign and wish that you would
Offer me a sign, relax my mind
Let me close by saying stop delaying our fate
Let go your fear I'm here come hold your soul make
I want more but I don't want push
It's never to late so be straight don't beat around the bush
I'm all woman if you don't feel like I feel that's fine
Let's stay friends but I want you to be mine now check it
But I'll take what I can take it can't get no plainer
With love sincerely yours your boo Dana
Oh P.S. guess who's back around
My ex he called me said he bought a house up town
But I told him that my love for you was too strong
Write back and don't make me wait to long
Oh, I don't know
(I don't know)
And it makes me scared
(Makes me so scared)
Because I'm falling in love
(I'm falling in love)
And I don't know if you feel the same
(I want to know, I wanna know)
Oh, I don't know
(I don't know)
And it makes me scared
(I'm so scared)
Because I'm falling in love
(I'm falling in love)
And I don't know if you feel the same
(Just me and my queen do you know what I mean)
Oh, I don't know
(Hey, hey)
And it makes me scared
(Hey, hey)
Because I'm falling in love
(Falling in love)
And I don't know if you feel the same
(Tell me if it's good enough for you)
