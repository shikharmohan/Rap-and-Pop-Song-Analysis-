Yeah, what's happenin'?
This one is dedicated to my niggaz
All my niggaz, out there, Gz up, hoes down
Yeah
Ladies and gents, playas and pimps listen
Snoop Doggy doggs on the mic pay attention
1, 2, or what shall I do ? I'm slippin' on my khaki suit
Which one? The blue one
Gun by my side, as I mob to the beach
On a mission and I'm fishin'
For my DJ Warren G, now I look for the bud's sack
And see where my loves at, on the lake where the doves at
Cognac is the drink that's drank by G's
Saggin' like a motherfucker khakis to they knees
Bitch please, you know how we do the undercover
I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg not your average motherfucker see
Some of you don't know about the G thang baby
It's the smooth gangsta shit that be drivin' ya crazy
Now as ya groove to the beat and ya move to the sound
I'm gonna hit ya with the Pound, Gz up, hoes down
Well, all the real Gz, please stand up
And let all be accounted for
And if you don't give a fuck about a bitch
Then you're rolling with the row
Back with the 1, 2, 3, and to the fo'
It's the S-N-O and to the O, P
Why am I so fly? I don't know, but
Why am I so high?
It's the indo, I don't fuck with the pocus, everybody knows this
Fuckin' with the Chronic, 'cuz the Chronic gives me dopeness
Now focus your eyes on these
Follow me, as I take ya rollin' with the Real OG's
East side, is the motherfuckin' place known as home
Doggy Dogg with my bone in my hand, and 20 grand
And some of you don't know about the G thang baby
It's the smooth gangsta shit that be drivin' ya crazy
Now as ya groove to the G-Funk, and move to the sound
I'm gonna hit ya with the Pound, Gz up, hoes down
Well, all the real Gz, please stand up
And let all be accounted for
And if you don't give a fuck about a bitch
Then you're rolling with the row
Hell yeah, ya know what I'm sayin'?
This is strictly for the Gz, yeah
Fuck that bitch, niggaz always be handcuffin' that hoe
When a nigga like me steps in the place
I don't want that hoe, I don't love that hoe
I'm caught up with my greens
Collard greens, indo and the cash flow
Ya know what I'm sayin'? Peace
Gz up, hoes down
