Umm, uh what the fuck, what time is it?
I swear I parked my car, shit
Aye, light hit my face sun brought the heat
Open my eyes, see my car parked across the street
And then it hit, I ain't really slept that long in a week
Matter fact I don't even remember falling asleep
Atlantic office claimin' J just keep calling the heat
Is it an emergency or something you need to talk to me?
J said, "I thought you needed to talk to me
If it's a change made aware I think I outta be
You making ultimatums now you don't talk to me
You make shit way worse then it outta be"
I ain't arguin' on the phone, come talk to me
I'll be waitin' on you, dawg at the office, peace
Now I'm thinkin' hard as I walk to my house
The fuck have I done now, what could he be talkin' 'bout?
I been stayin' outta trouble, shit I bin on the couch
You were workin' on the album, I was listenin' now
Then Doug called, "Ay you spoke to J?"
Yeah, is it something I don't know that I was supposed to say?
All I know before the hour I awoke today
Nigga commin' wit' the realist and he chose today
I'm real close to J, I seen ups and downs hit
But I ain't never heard him sound the way that he sounded
Really caught a nigga by surprise, I was astounded
He a real cool dude but why he call me clownin'?
You say'n you don't know bout it? Know bout what?
Atlantic records said you called the office and went nuts
Makin' death threats, talkin' loud, gettin' buck
Man, they said I did what? Folks I'm just gettin' up
Say you waitin' out your deal till you hear it's up
Planin' to make away with 20 million bucks
You bullshitin' me, right? Is you serious brugh?
Yeah, they said you found out the rapper T.I.P wit' us
I talked to Craig, Jewels and Kais a long time
Long story short they said you don lost ya damn mind
And I runnin' off deep and across ya damn mind
You crossed the thin line, I'm hearin' 'em tell Atlantic
It's so much shit about cha, they don't give a shit about cha
Say'n you ain't doin' nothing they couldn't have done without cha
You ain't never been hotta, worked a whole lotta years
And came up to go way back to the bottom, what?
Man, what the hell is y'all talkin' 'bout?
I been in the house all night
I don't know nothing 'bout that shit, man
I got the album right here, man, send this to 'em
