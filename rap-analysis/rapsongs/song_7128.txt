Uh uh, come on, S P in the
Up north into the NYC and the out West
And to niggas in Cali and the down south type dynamite
What, yo yo come on dynamite dynamite
Uh check it out, uh uh
Yo yo yo yo yo check it out
Everybody, touch this illa-fifth dynamite
C'mon, touch this illa-fifth dynamite
C'mon, touch this illa-fifth dynamite
Check it out, everybody
Touch this illa-fifth dynamite
C'mon, touch this illa-fifth dynamite
C'mon, touch this illa-fith dynamite
Yo, check it out, in in tro tro duc ducing
The sole missin' link, what could MC's who listen think
It's black thought, open your eyes and don't blink
Yo, to rock this mic is like a basic instinct
But yo in in tro tro duc ducing
Behind thee, the mic champion
More than a stepion
Mothafuckers sweatin' me, beggin' me just to get me on
Macro-cosmic, micro-master
Aiyyo I'm all the way way, phil phil lay lay
People wanna see the way the illadel play
Yo, look in the mirror, watch what yourself say
I'm from S P, no mortal man can test me
Thought, I keep a line in, upper eschulonein
Heineken, hold the rhymin' in, flows remindin' them
Cats that hear me up, some shit from back in the past
Your half-steppin' ass, could never fathom a grasp because
Yo we got a doctrine, in cold-rockin' it
Bringin' this apocalype, nigga you mad topical
Bitch my raps trick your optical
Mister superficial, I'm rippin apart your heart tissue
This is your official, dismissal
I don't study the artificial, who fuckin' wit the dark crystal
Yo where are is you? I'm movin like a smart missle
Aimed and guaranteed to hit you
Word up, but when the fifth do get on and perform, you in for it
It ain't no way to censor it, my style metaphoric
To bricks and ten tons stacks hard to lift
The artist, comin out the fifth darkness
We go back like ancients, while you ain't shit
Sub-terrainean, never against the grainean
Afro-American slash half bladean
In your universe, my star's the most radiant
Everybody, touch this illa-fifth dynamite
C'mon, touch this illa-fifth dynamite
C'mon, touch this illa-fifth dynamite
Check it out, everybody
Touch this illa-fifth dynamite
C'mon, touch this illa-fifth dynamite
C'mon, touch this illa-fith dynamite
Aiyyo it's all the way live, from 2 1 5
Plus admission is denied so just wait outside
Two extremes collide like Jekyl and Hyde
And I provide you wit the swerve you need, but take heed
You travelin' like speed
Iller than adventures you might read
Official original breed, the Justice League, yo it's the P 5 D
Style fashionist, other MC's they actresses
Yo it's the high-opposed, you bout to get shot down
Tryin to fly above this illa-fifth compound
You've known since the get-go, I rock your disco
Ain't nobody badder, but yo you get my gist so
I represent so you gotta squint
As far as how I do it you ain't compensate
We causin nuisance and get indecent so save your two cents
Don't come in my district, kickin' that bullshit
Yo it's all simplistic, limited click get
Lyrically lifted, touchin' the fifth shit
Trenches of the mentally twisted, you enlisted
5 was the emblem on the mic you got hit wit
And I stomp ya, 'til you call me conqueror
Back-slappin' all the niggas that slept
Thinkin that Elo could ever disappear
I'm strippin' they even near
Wit this non ether reefer, quiet frequent premiere
Everybody, touch this illa-fifth dynamite
C'mon, touch this illa-fifth dynamite
C'mon, touch this illa-fifth dynamite
Check it out, everybody
Touch this illa-fifth dynamite
C'mon, touch this illa-fifth dynamite
C'mon, touch this illa-fith dynamite
Everybody, touch this illa-fifth dynamite
C'mon, touch this illa-fifth dynamite
C'mon, touch this illa-fifth dynamite
Check it out, everybody
Touch this illa-fifth dynamite
C'mon, touch this illa-fifth dynamite
C'mon, touch this illa-fith dynamite
