(Lil Wayne & Nurse)
Where's my coffee?
Good Morning Dr. Carter (Hey Sweetie)
Looks like its going to be a long day. (Ahh. Another one huh? What we got?)
Your first patient (Yeah)
Is suffering from a lack of concepts: (Uh-Huh)
Originality, (Ugh)
His flow is weak, (Another one)
And he has no style. (Ugh)
What cha' got for 'em?
Verse 1 
(Lil Wayne)
TsÃ¢Â¦Okay, let me put my gloves on and my scrubs on.
Dr. Carter to the rescue. Excuse me if I'm late,
But like a thief it takes time to be this great,
Ha, so just wait. 
Your style is a disgrace,
Your rhymes are fifth place,
And I'mÃ¢Â¦ just grace.
One, Uno, Ace 
And I'm tryin' to make your heart beat like bass, (heh-heh)
But your sweet like cake and I come to fix,
Whatever you shall break. Where is your originality?
You are so fake so picture me like a gallery.
Capture what I say. All I need is one mic. All I need is one take.
Like hey, brighter then the sun's rays got a pistol on the playground.
Watch the gunplay like. No kidding. No kids in the way,
But the kids do watch. Gotta watch what we say. 
Gotta work everyday.
Gotta not be Cliche.
Gotta stand out like Andre 3-K,
Gotta kick it-kick it like a sensei.
You gotta have faith you gotta, gotta, wait, waitÃ¢Â¦I think IÃ¢Â¦I think I lost 'emÃ¢Â¦
Conversation 2:
(Lil Wayne & Nurse)
Good Afternoon Dr. Carter (Worst?)
I don't know about this one,
His confidence is down, 
Vocab and metaphors needs work, 
And he lost respect for the game. (UghÃ¢Â¦Lemme see)
You think you can save 'em?
Verse 2 (Lil Wayne)
Okay.
Respect is in the heart.
So thats where I'ma start.
And a lot of heart patients don't make it.
Now hey kids-plural I graduated
'Cause you could get through anything if Magic made it.
And that was called recycling
Or re-reciting
Something 'cause you just like it, so you say it just like it.
Some say its biting, but I say its enlightening
Besides Dr. Kanye West is one of the brightest,
And Dr. Swizz can stitch your track up the tightest,
And Dr. Jeezy can fix your back up the nicest,
Arthritis in my hand from writing.
But I'ma Doctor they don't understand my writing, so I stop writing.
Now I'm like lightingÃ¢Â¦
And you ain't Vince Young so don't clash with the Titans.
Fast and exciting.
My passion is freighting.
Now let me put some more Vocab in your I.V.
Here take this Vicodin 
Like it and love itÃ¢Â¦
And confidence has no budget
So pay me no mind I don't walk-like I talk it 'cause I'm running-I don't do it 'Cause I done it-and I'm in the emergency on itÃ¢Â¦
(God Darnet I've lost another oneÃ¢Â¦)
Conversation 3:
(Lil Wayne & Nurse)
Good Evening Dr. Carter.
It's been a long day, but this one looks better than the others,
His respect is back up,
Concepts sound good, 
His style is showing strong signs of improvement,
All he needs now is his swagger. (Okay, let me take off my gloves thenÃ¢Â¦)
Verse 3 (Lil Wayne)
Swagger tighter than a yeast infection,
Fly go hard like geese erection,
Fashion patrol police detection,
I stay tight like Chinese connection,
I stay tight like pussy at night,
Baby don't get me wrong I could do that pussy right,
But I'm to wrong to write,
To fresh to fight,
To paid to freestyle,
To paid to freestyle,
I had to say it twice,
Swagger so nice,
And don't ask me **** unless it concerns a price,
And I don't rap fast I rap slow,
Cause I mean every letter in the words in the sentence of my quotes,
Swagger just flow sweeter than honey oats,
That swagger I got it I wear it like a coat,
Wait, as I put the light down his throat,
I can only see flow,
His blood starting to flow,
His lungs starting to grow,
This one starting to show,
Strong signs of life,
Where's the stitches here's the knife,
Smack his face his eyes open,
I reply "What a Night!"
Welcome back Hip-Hop I saved your Life!
Outro:
(Nurse)
He looks good,
His vitals are up,
He's looking good,
He's looking good,

Yup. Yup! We got one,
We saved him, he's good,
He's good,
We got one,
He's good...
He's good
We got 'em
We saved 'em, he's a go!
