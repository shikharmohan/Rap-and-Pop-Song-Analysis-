Yo, yo, what?
I heard he sang a good song, yeah
Yo, I heard he had a style
And so, I came to see him and listen for awhile
What? And there he was, this young bra
Stranger to my eyes
Strummin' my pain with his fingers, yo
Singing my life with his words, two times
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life, with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Strummin' my pain
Yes, he was singing my life with his words, two times
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life, with his words
Killing me softly with his song
