They ass from here to El Segundo, lets get ready to rumble
Spit sparks, spit flames the coldest thing up under the sun though
Spending your money on them suckers your wastin' you time
'Cause I'm the one hoe, smokin' that blunt smoke
Stay out of my front though, swung with the blast,
I've never been matched, I hop on the track like a jump rope
I come with the guillotine to cut throat
Holdin' it down messin ya'll up with the rest of them suckers be umcho
Me?  Yeah, blessed if you don't know, packin' big bone heavy struture And hung low, wreckin' ball nuts it touch the flo'
If it's on yo' chest then just let me know
I hope you don't think I'm runnin' I know you don't think I'm scared
You must of forgot who the hell that I am
The man with the braids beware

Bats and pipes  broken bottles, glass, and knives
Jump in the mix and don't handle yo' business
Somebody turn out yo' lights!
You'll be gettin' yo' stupid self up
Askin' the people "Which one of ya'll hit?"
I don't know the way you went down look like the ground was slippery
Attack'em with sawed-offs, suckas get throwed off
The party get called off, when suckas get sawed-offs
I go give her my meat to meet and give it to her raw dog
You, go get the nasty, givin' that stuff, get bought off
I come with the real I be with them brothers with booted up grills
We don't do promotions and shows that stuff don't pay my bills
Keep it in the ballin' ballin', promoters callin'
Videos jumpin' off sucka this the real New Orleans
My neck of the woods, my side of the hood my part of town
Thugs, drugs, and violence y'alls is watered down
When I perform I'm that calm and I'm the boom rec'
I hit the studio show
All right yeah you right start fightin'
Get it right keep in right we be hype
Knockin' 'em down, throwin' 'em away, hittin' 'em hard
Takin' 'em out, bustin' there head breakin' 'em off
