Double to the G, G
Double to the G
Snoop D O, double to the G
Hey you, out there
Fat ass, good hair
Hell with my homies
I wanna kick it with you
'Cuz I got my swilla
Packed to the ceilla
For what you heard, don't be scared
Tell me what's the deal-a
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Ay, what's yo' name and who you with?
Have a seat, baby girl, come and limp with a pimp
Relax, you know I got this shit
Split that squishy while I pop this Cris
Yeah, girl, it's the D O dub
How you feel on the real? I wanna be yo' thug
Now I wanna treat it like it's never been treated
Mix it up, fix it up, beat it and eat it
Psst! Baby, let me holla at you
Psst! I'm tryna throw these dollas at you
Psst! Boy, what you want?
Psst! Tell me what you want
Psst! Baby, let me holla at you
Psst! I'm tryna throw these dollas at you
Psst! Boy, what you want?
Psst! Tell me what you want
Your love so bold
And so cold like a fridgerator
You work that ass up and down
Like an elevator
Don't you wish your boyfriend
Was a gangsta like me?
But he ain't and don't drink slow and think so
'Coz hey, I crack a bitch every motherfuckin' day
And I'm likin' it, lovin' it, twerkin' it
And now you dippin' it, diggin' in, workin' it
Why you wanna go an do that? It's not T.I.
The boss with the horse, Snoopy D O double G Y
And I'm settin' the tone
You know, me and you, we need to be gettin' it on
In a real way, it's so major
Me and J. Fox wanna fly y'all to Asia
So what's stoppin' y'all? Let's get it poppin', y'all
A little somethin' for the head Like a Tylenol
Groove and do yo' doo
And don't play with it, go and make yo' move
Boy, what you want?
Tell me what you want
Psst! Baby, let me holla at you
Psst! I'm tryna throw these dollas at you
Psst! Boy, what you want?
Psst! Tell me what you want
Psst! Baby, let me holla at you
Psst! I'm tryna throw these dollas at you
Psst! Boy, what you want?
Psst! Tell me what you want
Girl, you know you're show stoppin'
When you get that body rockin'
Let's roll these trees on ya
[Incomprehensible] and get that dose up on ya
Yeah, Snoop Dogg and J. Foxx
We're lookin' for some dream girls
Close your eyes baby
And dream on this, yeah, respect
