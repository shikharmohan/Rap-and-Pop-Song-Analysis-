Fresh out this bitch pussy
Hay in the middle of the barn don
Super hoe puttin on the freak show
Inside the mini mansion had bitches dancin 
and the naked bitch you aint ready
My dick is 2 percent head
98 percent shaft heavy
Steadily long strokin shit
P stands for penetration
While y'all parlaying
I'm in the back 
Diggin her back while shorty hollerin
Candy girl
Took a blast of the shit
I got her in the pretzel
Pushin her legs back she wet too
Perverted niggas do this type of shit all day
Sodomize modernize em
Up to my standards
1996 bitches got ran through
1997 cancel that hoe
She blessed the God well though
Word Up son you know what Im sayin
You know how that go though
Caligula style young love
Model actress
Superstar porno star on the mattress
Lookin like Jada Pinkett
I stabbed it
The vultures grabbed it 
Money No date raped it
Videotaped it
Handy Cam Record
The bitch is blowin me
My dick went soft 
Young Luv
Scrubbin that crotch with Dove
Potpourri bitches get fucked and mouth plugged
So lady cop, secretaries and librarians
Midtown high class hoe with pearl earrings
Bump into a true to life vulture like me
Beat you over the head with G
Drag you back to the cage 
And let this mobb nigga coach boo
Train that ass
Put it on curfew
Hey Young Luv
Young Luv Young Luv
Left it in the hotel
Must have been we don't love em
Before you consider it foul
Let me put you on cousin
88 had a vision on some rap shit
Not knowin it would happen
Down the road gold status
But back then
There was this one little chick
That I wanted to hit get with
The whole shit
14 layin my G
Little me
I had to have her 
Had a nigga like me losin Zs
No Sleep
Fucked up in the head over her physique
Even thought about goin downtown
I know there's niggas out there that would have felt the same way
It was the freak in me
Actually crossed my mind frequently
Finally and once again
We bumped heads
A stank gesture
Suggested that I was dead like a crackhead
Didn't even give a nigga real
But fuck it
What can I say
I tried to put my little bid and kept livin
Nigga move on 
You a man
No matter what it take we're gonna hold the upper hand
Shufflin beats
Six years later son it was done
The Infamous Mobb Deep
Left you stuck off the Shook Ones
And then funniest thing after a show backstage
I peeped chick 
Who didn't give me play back in the day
It was all love
Hold no grudge gave her a hug
Whats the drilly baby
She was like you 
nah whats up
You know me
Doin my thing tryin to live
Asked if I was busy could I chill with her in her crib
No days
But we can chill up in the Ramada
Payback is a bitch
Once I get it there I got her in the telly
E&J; dick popped the cherry
Left the little hoe with no dough and got jetty
Bless the God boo
You know how we do
It's self explainable
Undomesticatable 
But highly we capable
The turntables beat you in your own game
Enough said
Another victim caught up in fame's web
Young Luv Young Luv
