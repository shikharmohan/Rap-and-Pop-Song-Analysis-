Yo, hehe
Tell him, ho, it's like uhh, you know, uhh
Sweet, sweet
Tell him, uhh, mmm
Let me be patient, let me be kind
Make me unselfish without bein' blind
Though I may suffer, I'll envy it not
And endure what comes, 'cause he's all that I got and tell him
Tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
And it'll be alright
And tell him
Tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
It'll be alright
Now I may have faith, to make mountains fall
But if I lack love, then I am nothin' at all
I can give away, everything I possess
But I'm without love then I have no happiness
I know I'm imperfect and not without sin
But now that I'm older all childish things end and tell him
Tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
It'll be alright
Tell him
Tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
It'll be alright
I'll never be jealous
And I won't be too proud
'Cause love is not boastful
Ooh and love is not loud
Tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
Everything is gonna, is gonna be alright
Ooh, ooh, yeah yeah, oh yeah
Now I may have wisdom and knowledge on earth
But if I speak wrong, ooh, then what is it worth?
See what we now know is nothing compared
To the love that was shown when our lives were spared and tell him
Tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
It'll be alright
Tell him
Tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
It'll be alright
