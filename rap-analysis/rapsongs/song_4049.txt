Hahahaaaha
That's right baby!
[VERSE 1]
Uh, slick dick and you're my one and two
So sweet what I did what a honeydew 
No point attended, no one offended
You just better not leave your girlfriend unattended 
I holla at her, holla but don't scream,
I ask her "why sleep if we don't dream?"
So lets stay awake besides dreams are fake
She say "ooh you deep" 
I ask "how deep can you take?"
Hehe, my love boat in your lake
Baby can I stick my love note in your gate?
Hehe, read it and weep
Sincerely fuckin yours weezy F.B
[CHORUS]
and my name is weezy baby!! 
And I'm
Young mula baby!! 
[VERSE 2]

shawty soul gold, and so is my crown
baby callin me bad, 
shawty toes red, and so is my flag
purple in my bag black pearls like that!
And she don't wanna she don't wanna let wayne go!
She just wanna wanna follow the Waynebow 
And im gonna let her
Cuz me and her colors create art together
[CHORUS]
and my name is weezy baby!! 
And I'm
Young mula baby!!
[VERSE 3]
I'd prefer that you would just call me Weezy
Eastside gangsta, and I be runnin this shit
Like the flanker
Black car banker
Hanker in the back pocket and I wear them skinny jeans
So you see my fat wallet That's right I'm a big shot
Call me little cannonball, Mr. Gets up in your girl mouth
Like some amber salt,
Hip hop president 
Aint my girl eloquent? 
Don't she got more junk in her trunk
Then an elephant?
Nigga im a animal! 
Watch me I examine you!
And my trucks are ohÃ¢Â¦ But I swear to you my flammable 
Man I get money manual 
Then I just man you 
Bitch that nigga! 
Im gonna light my land roof young money!
