(Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello)
Hey, what's happenin'?
It's been a minute
(Hello)
Huh? I'm just hollerin'
(Hello)
How you doin?
It's been a minute since I seen ya, I fell off for the scene
'Cuz it seem like you wanted other things than da king
Why you fightin', fussin', cussin', and disagreein' wit da king?
When you got cribs, cars, bling, and a king wit da king?
Is the grass as green as it seemed in ya dreams
Are you gettin' all the things that you needed and I ain't bring
Does it satisfy your self-esteem bein' seen on da screen
Is this new nigga the real thing or is just a lil' fling?
Did he buy a nice bracelet and get ya a lil' ring?
Or give you all the attention and the lil' things?
He know what to do with the stuff you stuff in them lil' jeans?
Do he stand up and lean in it 'til you start screamin'?
Or smack your ass and kiss your G-string to start eatin'?
You get how you need it, not only when it's convenient
I just pick up the phone and call you every week or two
To let you know I miss you, to see how that other nigga treatin' you
I remember morning, noon and night
I used to hold you tight
I know we used to fuss and fight
But I'm just calling to say
(Hello)
Hello
(Hello)
Hello, oh baby
See time has its own funny way of keeping us close
Even though we never stayed, together
I just wanted to say
(Hello)
Hello
Hello, baby
Ay, it's me, hey, what's happenin? How ya doin'?
I know plenty of niggas pursuin' them panties, all for the screwin'
Fly you down to Miami
Let you walk the red carpet when I'm out at da Grammys
But I'm what he can never be, a boss, understand me?
He pose and take pictures an' things he buy for ya
He got you a rose, but that don't mean he'd die for ya
Hey, maybe I got too much pride to cry for ya
But not too much to call you and tell you that I adore ya
And tell you how I'm missin you, lovin' you, and kissin' you
And think about the good old days and wanna visit you
This song I'd like to listen to whenever reminisicin' you
You, stay on my mind nevermind how I picture you
Think about the past and all the time that I spent witchu
Rubbin' on that ass from behind as I dig in you
Never been a doubt in my mind that I was diggin' you
How I love you shorty, you'll never find another nigga to
I remember morning, noon and night
I used to hold you tight
I know we used to fuss and fight
But I'm just calling to say
(Hello)
Hello
(Hello)
Hello, oh baby
See time has its own funny way of keeping us close
Even though we never stayed, together
I just wanted to say
(Hello)
Hello
Hello, baby
Every now and then I think of you
And I can't lie I be wantin' you
But I understand that I'm not your man
And I also know that the future's not in your hands
So every now and then I'd call you to say how you doin'
And baby I miss you
Girl, this is just to say hello, hello baby
I remember morning, noon and night
I used to hold you tight
I know we used to fuss and fight
But I'm just calling to say
(Hello)
Hello
(Hello)
Hello, oh baby
See time has its own funny way of keeping us close
Even though we never stayed, together
I just wanted to say
(Hello)
Hello
Hello, baby
Hello, hello, hello, hello
