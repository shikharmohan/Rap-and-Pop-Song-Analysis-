Boogie man, boogie man, boogie man
Boogie man, my whole life is real
My life my life my life my life
A-ha, Brooklyn you know
My life my life my life my life, it's a real thang
Listen, my whole life is real, morning news and nights is real
What I spit and I write is real, 'cuz my life is real
My own life is ill filled with magic's strife to scale
Sun bright, no time to chill, got all type of bills
I got seeds I gotta feed with this they be needin' shit
I got ex-wife beef and shit that's how deep it get
My whole life is real, my whole life is ill a fantastic
A beautiful mess and life nigga in America, the usual stress
I do it to the up, low, the east and the west
I do it to most, I do it to death, I do so it good
They don't know what to do with they selves well do this
Move, back, forward, mo' life is real, let's move on
My whole life is real, morning news and nights is real
What I spit and I write is real, 'cuz my life is ill
Filled with magic's strife to scale sun bright, no time to chill
Got all type of bills I got seeds I gotta feed with this
I got streets I gotta reach with this that's how deep it get
My whole life is ill, my whole life is real mornings
Noon's, nights, birthdays, workdays, holidays
Funerals, the usual life is real, Sunday to Monday
School, your gun play, politics, bullshit, life is real
Shootings, stabbing, free tray, arrest crush, kill
Destroy, cheques death, rebirth reach the world
But touch the street first life goin' in every direction
But rewind niggaz is waiting for the light to dive down
On a park a hustler plays the hide out, somebody's
Gotta notice it's a matter of time before the world fine out
The earth dry out and push the hintin' to high ground
Life style hostile, real, life real real, so real, too real
News real edited the close up block out the rest of
It true evident, false measurement crunk superstar
Thug president tricks allegiance, M-Def payment ship
Scribe lively, so timely,that is timeless and is lovely
And is ugly, as it must be
My whole life is real, morning news and nights is real
What I spit and I write is real, 'cuz my life is ill
Filled with magic's strife to scale sun bright, no time to chill
Got all type of bills I got seeds I gotta feed with this
I got streets I gotta reach with this that's how deep it get
My whole life is real, Brooklyn know
My life my life my life my life
B.X. know
My life my life my life my life
Real niggaz all over the world
My life my life my life my life, it's a real thang
Boogie man!
