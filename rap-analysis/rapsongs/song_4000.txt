People with jobs, people without jobs
Middle class, upper class, high class, all that
Cats, snakes, chickens, ducks, elderly people and twerkers

Y'all Betty Crocker balla blockas, I'm too heavy
Meatball, Lamborghini, top spaghetti
Seats, Ragu, up 20 inch shoes
Oh, me and you got plenty to do
I don't need no pool, I'm swimmin' in you
And I sleep with the sharks, shorty on the water, water

We don't breed them kind but they bleed just fine

Ya betta get the army, y'all gone need them for me
And ya head is a bleepin' target
Y'all want me to see you with my peekin' tourmis
Wizzle fizzle, I keep in New Orleans
Sleepin' with women that sleep with the Hornets
A country boy is sumthin' foreign
'Bout a hundred thousand more than what you're in
You're not 'bout it, you freeze up like popsicles
Pop up on bicycles, pop y'all like spot pimples
Yup, wizzle fizzle, original hot bizzle
Still Lil' Wayne but da dividend's not little
