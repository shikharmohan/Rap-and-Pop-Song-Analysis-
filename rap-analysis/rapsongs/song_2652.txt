Yo foxy, shorty yo
Don't let that pretty shit fool you yo
I ain't pay that bitch phone bill
This is for all my ballin' ass bitches
All over worldwide
Shake them thighs for them pies
For all my niggas on every street corner
That's right, love you all niggas
This is for the baller bitch
The waller bitch
My niggas never call a bitch
You all be rich
So Short, what you mean?
I bet I be a poor girl's dream
More money than she ever seen
This is for the baller cats
All the cats
That want a bitch to lay on their back
To hell with that
So Fox what you mean?
Bet I be a poor nigga's dream
More money than he ever seen
Kiss the projects goodbye
I'm a change you bitch
I'm a have niggas thinkin' you a famous bitch
Here's the keys to the Benz but don't start the car
If you good I'm a let you park the car
From a straight broke ass to a baller bitch
They got no other choice but to call you rich
I got hella fly ladies, never cry ladies
Those cheat on they man type, tell a lie ladies
Diamond rings, platinum chains
Tell them 'Baller Bitch' when they ask your name
I say strut that strut
Walk that walk, pop that shit, talk that talk
Hold your head high, be proud of this life
Pray to God that you never fall out of this life
'Cause it's much more better than all world scenes
Bitch open up your eyes, it's a poor girls dream
This is for the baller bitch
The waller bitch
My niggas never call a bitch
Y'all be rich
So Short, what you mean?

More money than he ever seen

Here's the keys to the crib
Have you lovin' this life
And bitches ain't nothing fuckin' with a thug in your life
And you frontin' ass niggas who be courtin' the hype
Like they OT
And ain't ever sold a drug in they life
I got husslin' ass niggas
Thuggin' ass niggas
Always on some shit never trustin' ass niggas
Bust your guns niggas cop your ones
And tell them 'Big Baller' when you flash your ones
Nigga lock the bar down
Show these cats how it's done
And slide through the hood and go fuck with your Dons
This is for the baller bitch
The waller bitch
My niggas never call a bitch
You all be rich
So Short, what you mean?

And if there's Cris in this bitch
Then I'm poppin' it first
And if the 700s come, I'll be coppin' it first
So whenever you see some hot shit, I'm rockin' it first
Shit, droppin' it first
The pardon choppin' it first
Basically when I ride by I'm hurtin' them worse
So now, boo what you gonna do?
You see how quick I got you
That's how quick I will drop you
This is for the baller bitch
The waller bitch
My niggas never call a bitch
Y'all be rich
So Short, what you mean?
