Let's talk it over now 
Let's talk it over now 
[Lil' Wayne] 
Uh-Hmm 
Hey Princess 
Yeah You 
Knew I would love you like a fat kid love food 
Knew I would score like Shaq did in school 
Knew I was stupid, knew I'd look like a big fool 
I must of had the flu, I thought that she was cool 
Knew you would fall in love with me and the shit I do 
But never knew that you would murder me what did I do 
Knew you was right for me, knew I was right for you 
Knew I would help you sell, knew I would write for you 
Knew I would keep you well, knew I would fight for you 
Knew I would pull out my heart and bring it right to you 
You knew all about me baby but you wasn't about me baby 
Young Wayne prepare for change 
Cause it seems like girly don't care the same 
You had my chain, you bared my name 
Then we had champagne 
Let's take a toast 
To you and me 
Let's drink a toast to our love 
And the way it's supposed to be 
[Lil' Wayne] 
Other people telling me I fell off 
Other people telling me I felt y'all 
Mama telling me I should at least call 
My mind telling me she should at least call 
Felt like I was at the bottom of the seesaw 
Felt like I was at the bottom of the seashore 
But you gotta let her be boy 
And when you open up your eyes I hope you see more 
And when I see you, I see detour 
Don't need to be depressed anymore 
Baby girl I need more 
Now run your mouth 'til your knees sore 
Let's talk it over 
Let's talk it over 
Let's talk it over now 
Let's talk it over 
Let's talk it over 
Let's talk it over now 
Let's talk it over 
Let's talk it over 
Let's talk it over now 
[Lil' Wayne] 
Five carrots on her finger got her hands mitted 
But everybody get a ring even Scottie Pippen 
Everybody got a thing but I guess mine isn't 
What my vision 
So I just sits in my Lamborghini, let my top vibe wit me 
Kick back and get high wit me 
And if she still get me 
I hope my wife know she got a player for life and that's no bullshitting 
I push love to it's full limits 
Do 190 in the lane called memory 
And I know youin that lane with me 
And when that light change, you didn't change with it 
And I'm honkin my horn 
Gotta get the dead grass off of my lawn 
Yeah as I mows on 
The champagne's never froze-on, as it pours on the floor 
Let's take a toast 
To you and me 
Let's drink a toast to our love 
And the way it's supposed to be
