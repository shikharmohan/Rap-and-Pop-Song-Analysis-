VERSE1:
I was born into this world
Little bitty baby girl
And when I look at why looking so glad
In a racist world
Now it's a difficult process
The matter is of perception
When I look in the mirror what do I see
Is it my reflection?
CHORUS:
Seein' repercussions (talkin bout the things we do)
Ya need to know the repercussions (things can come right back to you)
Look at them repercussions (what goes around comes around)
Heyyy repercussions
VERSE2:
See I was born into this
In another space in time
Time has moved on a death has grown closer
Surely has blown my mind (blown my mind)
Aint that a b**ch...the way the world spins around (spins around, spins around, spins around)
Everything, everything, everything that I said and I did
Surely came back around
CHORUS:
See repercussions (talkin bout the things we do)
Repercussions (things sure can come back to you)
Yeah repercussions (what goes around comes around)
Yeah repercussions (they will get you down)
Repercussions (talkin' bout the things we do)
Yeah Repercussions (things sure can come back to you)
Ya need to know that repercussions (what goes around comes around)
Repercussions (they will get you down)
