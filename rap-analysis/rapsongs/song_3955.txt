uh ha ha ha,
I don't care what y'all say,
(chorus)
Oh, lets rock n' roll
This time I'm control
Right now I own the streets
I got the keys to the city 
That's cause I get down
Oh, lets rock n' roll
This time I'm control
Right now I own the streets
I got the keys to the city 
That's cause I get down
Sometimes I wonder how I made it this far
With all these people hate'n on me
Y'all know who you are
Said girls are being losers
The game won't go that far
But know I own the keys to a brand new fancy car, baby
It's my turn to burn and know I'm gonna rub it in your face
When will you learn I'm queen and I'll put you in your place,
Ah huh huh,
(chorus)
How dare you try to go against the glorious one,
I'll slaughter you son
It's over
The story is done
You can be number two
But I'm second to none
And you forgot queen bee is the notorious one
Oh
Baby baby I'm a lady
I'm the crÃÃÂ¨me de la crÃÃÂ¨me so you can never play me
See I'm more than your lady
I'll be more than a lover more than a love to you
Please try to understand me 
Gonna stay at the top cause I don't give a damn
(speak)
I don't care what y'all say 
I'm gonna keep doin me 
That can't fade me
(chorus x2)
