P.L.O. style, Buddha Monks with the owls
P.L.O. style, Buddha Monks with the owls
P.L.O. style, Buddha Monks with the owls
P.L.O. style
Here comes the ruckus, the motherfuckin' ruckus
Thousands of cut throats and purse snatchin' fuckers
Straight from the brain I'll be givin' you the pain
Anger, comin' from the thirty sixth chamber, bang
Tical, hittin' with the Buddha fist style
Shotgun slammin' in your chestpiece, plow
Brain is blown all over the terrain
Like a man without no arms you can't hang
Time for a change of the guard
You've been arrested for lyric fraud now you hard
For real, check it, I pull strings like B.B. King on guitar
I'm the true fist of the North Star
Ooh, what a tangled web we weave
When first we practice to decieve
Guns be clickin', runnin' with my clan, we be stickin'
Whatever, my street family stay together
Represent what I invent, Killa Hill
Resident, rest in peace to my nigga two cent
The street life is the only life I know
I live by the code style it's mad P.L.O.
Iranian thoughts and cover like an Arabian
Grab a nigga on the spot and put a nine to his Cranium
I can't get no satisfaction, niggas won't be lastin'
Long, unless they get protection, for real
Strong, comin' with my clan so what's happenin'
Commercial rap, hate it with a passion
The M E T H O D got me drinkin OE all night in a M.P.V
Just maxin, lookin' for hoes, you know relaxin'
Bitches know the hour it be time for some action
P.L.O., peace to that nigga Barryano
Word up, let's take him to the bridge, Verrazano
P.L.O. style, Buddha Monks with the owls
P.L.O. style, Buddha Monks with the owls
P.L.O. style, Buddha Monks with the owls
P.L.O. style
