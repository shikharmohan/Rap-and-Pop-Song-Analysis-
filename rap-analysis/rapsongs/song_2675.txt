Fox Five, let's go
See it ain't no party like a Fox Brown party
'Cuz a Fox Brown party don't stop but them bottles a pop
When Fox Five come through in the drop
But chinchilla on my back, it's the King, the rap
Catch us [Incomprehensible], up in Bungalow 8
Rollin' through in the cranberry SK8
And call the crew, tell 'em come to the crib
I did my time, it's all water under the bridge
I got knocked and it felt like a part of my life
But I'm back home, I'ma party tonight
Through the pool party since no one else is home
All my friends happy for me, tell me "Welcome home" and
Yeah, I know I got busted for a crime
Now I'm tryna have fun to make up for lost times
The world is mine, I'm so refocused
But I'm back this time and I'm back to grind, so
What you gonna do when you get out of jail?
I'm gon' have some fun
What do you consider fun?
Fun, natural fun
We drinkin' on the liquor 'til there ain't no more
Tell me if you drinkin' with me
We drinkin' on the liquor 'til there ain't no more
Tell me if you drinkin' with me
And, this is how it's 'sposed to be
No police, all night, hopefully
'Cuz we got Armadale vodka too, I got
One of my homies on the ones and twos and
The food is bangin', the hate is gone
Speakers blastin' the latest songs
And all that time they had me alone
Now I'm with my family, I'm happy I'm home and
We two steppin' 'cuz it's back in style
My friends laughin' and actin' wild
See this type of thing happens all the time
But you gotta get yours just like I'm gon' get mine
Everythin' is fine with my friends I pack a whole place in
For one day I forget the probation
I won't stop 'til the party is done
And see I'm gon' have some fun
What you gonna do when you get out of jail?
I'm gon' have some fun
What do you consider fun?
Fun, natural fun
We drinkin' on the liquor 'til there ain't no more
Tell me if you drinkin' with me
We drinkin' on the liquor 'til there ain't no more
Tell me if you drinkin' with me
Ain't no party like a Fox Five party
'Cuz a Fox Five party don't stop
Ain't no party like a Fox Five party
'Cuz a Fox Five party don't stop
Yeah, I made the crime but I paid the time
And from this day on, I'ma take my shine
You see I made the crime but I paid the time
And from this day on I'ma take my shine, so, yeah
I can't forgive 'em, I'm livin' my life different
I'm seein' just what I'm missin', I ain't tryna go to prison again
They got me on constant watch
But anythin' is better than to be on lock, so
What you gonna do when you get out of jail?
I'm gon' have some fun
What do you consider fun?
Fun, natural fun
We drinkin' on the liquor 'til there ain't no more
Tell me if you drinkin' with me
We drinkin' on the liquor 'til there ain't no more
Tell me if you drinkin' with me
What you gonna do when you get out of jail?
I'm gon' have some fun
What do you consider fun?
Fun, natural fun
We drinkin' on the liquor 'til there ain't no more
Tell me if you drinkin' with me
We drinkin' on the liquor 'til there ain't no more
Tell me if you drinkin' with me
Fox Brown, Fox Brown
Fox Brown, Fox Brown
Fox Brown, Fox Brown
