Yea, check 1,2, one time for ya mind
2 times for ya mind, pmd going braceline, bassline
Prodigy, hit squad and the mobb. 9-7, check it out
Hey, yo, six foot and change, I still do my thang
You niggaz is game, blacker skills wit the hand swing
Time to black out, you act out, blow ya back out
The p wit the no-look pass like iverson and stackhouse
(prodigy)
Hey, yo, painkiller key raps, get dope off of this here shit
Writing prescriptions for your addiction
We doing it, yo, p, this shit is off the meter
Neither him nor his man neither can top this shit hit
(chorus)(pmd)
It's the p-double e-m-d-e-e(yo, it's the p)
E-double pushing up lex bubble(3 1/2x)
Check p, the rap vet, freak the rap tech
Peep the black tech, ass bent, run, some will leave your back wet
So pmd and prodigy will hit you hard
Lace p wit the plan and let the mobb do the phucking job
(prodigy)
I kick, shit that you can feel like you're holding it
Grab a hold of this, rip tight like it's your last bit
Futuristic, hi-tech computer chip
Lyric that's beyond the year 2000
The dominant, confident niggaz is conquering
Overminding, my mom done did it again
Vertical rap, straight up and down this wolf pack
Or go at the whole globe, attack the map
Ambassador p, we strengthly strip his sleeves of his stripes
Granted for the rest of your life
Now you can sit back and cherish the time that we spent
The foul memory of ? timbos, bison less? 
(pmd)
Now who's the kid claiming death wit the s on his chest
Smoking cess, sounding like meth, I guess he need press
And yes, he must be insane wit no brain, on that cocaine
Lying on your dick, saying you hit jane
The punk doctor, I gotcha, so get the boz-ile
You little hostile, you end up missing like hoffa
My style's proper, extraordinaire, quite rare
Excellent to the ear, so kid, you never compare
Chorus
