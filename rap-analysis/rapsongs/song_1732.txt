Listen while they're comin' man hurry up
With the party dog, shh, be quiet
Enter a new dimension, can't you feel the tension
Ever heard the word prevention, well, you really need to pay attention
You only need a little bit, so you want another hit?
Call emergency on the telephone, you're in the danger zone
"Just lounge, you're in the danger zone"
"Just lounge, you're in the danger zone"
"Just lounge, you're in the danger zone"
"Just lounge, you're in the danger zone"
You're in the zone, when you need another upper
You took a slip and goin' out like a sucker
Matter of fact, you're more than just slippin'
You're way beyond control, you're on a mission
You walk right through a wall, to get a twenty, a forty or an eight ball
And once you enter this area
There ain't nothin scarier, all I wanna say to ya
Is just back the Hell up
You need to go where they let you do your thing in a cup
And you take a diagnosis, you see your boy Shock G wrote this
To open up your mind, do you know who I am, deliverer of a rhyme
My job is to verbally slay suckers, like an Uzi spray motherfuckers
The underground is gonna get ya
Now pay attention you're about to enter
Into a new dimension, can't you feel the tension
I'm sure you heard the word prevention
So like I said pay attention, you only need a little bit
Ya still want another hit? Even if it's home grown
Yo, you're in the danger zone
"Just lounge, you're in the danger zone"
"Just lounge, you're in the danger zone"
"Just lounge, you're in the danger zone"
"Just lounge, you're in the danger zone"
"Just lounge, you're in the danger zone"
"Just lounge, you're in the danger zone"
"Just lounge, you're in the danger zone"
"Just lounge, you're in the danger zone"
On the corner, I see cocaine addicts
Givin static and about to go at it
And then you hear somebody holler
Who was it K? it was Dopefiend Carla
She was waitin' on a winner
That hoe, every night she has crack for dinner
But everybody's basin
Even the suckers who are runnin' this nation
Yes, I'm pullin' no punches
The government gets drugs in bunches
Shock G get the nine
But don't shoot until I finish my rhyme
This zone, makes suckers stop breathin'
Sweat bullets drop down to their knees and
Start beggin' for your pipe cause you're all in
Sometimes you can feel yourself fallin'
Into a new dimension, can't you feel the tension?
Don't let me forget to mention
The underground is puttin' their two cents in
What's the matter, feelin' blue? Does this record bother you?
If so, you need to leave it alone, you're in the danger zone
"Just lounge, you're in the danger zone"
"Just lounge, you're in the danger zone"
"Just lounge, you're in the danger zone"
"Just lounge, you're in the danger zone"
"Just lounge, you're in the danger zone"
"Just lounge, you're in the danger zone"
"Just lounge, you're in the danger zone"
"Just lounge, you're in the danger zone"
Caught a red light downtown
Freak was on the tip, 'cause my window was down
Stuck her head in the car, it was dopefiend carla
She said "Can you spare five dollars?", I said, "Hell no"
She said "I'm not asking for much"
I said bitch, I'd rather give a crippled crab a crutch
She said "why you wanna clown me"
I said "It's simple, I don't like fiends hangin' round me
Can't you see, that you got a disease?
You weight sixty six pounds, down from a hundred and three"
The light turned green and I was gone
She was livin' in the danger zone
It's a new dimension, can't you feel the tension
You recognize this sound, go on, just put the pipe down
What's the matter, feelin' blue? Does this record bother you?
If so you need to leave it alone, punk, you're in the danger zone
"Just lounge, you're in the danger zone"
"Just lounge, you're in the danger zone"
"Just lounge, you're in the danger zone"
"Just lounge, you're in the danger zone"
"Just lounge, you're in the danger zone"
"Just lounge, you're in the danger zone"
"Just lounge, you're in the danger zone"
"Just lounge, you're in the danger zone"
"Just lounge, you're in the danger zone"
"Just lounge, you're in the danger zone"
"Just lounge, you're in the danger zone"
"Just lounge, you're in the danger zone"
