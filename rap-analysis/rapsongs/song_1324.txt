So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large, a big house five cars the rent charged
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
I remember the days when I was a young kid
Growin' up, lookin' in the mirror dreamin' about blowin' up
To rock crowds make money chill wit the honies
Sign autographs and whatever the people want from me, shits funny
How impossible cream manifest in the games that be comin' with it
Never the less you gotta go for the gusto
But you don't know about the blood sweat and tears
And losin' some of your peers and losin' some of your self
Music has past gone by hopefully you don't manifest
For the wrong guy Egomaniac, in the Brainiac
Don't know how to act, shits deep
Forty eight tracks studio gangsta mack
Sign a deal emcees wanna make a mill
But never will till he crosses over still
Feelin' no hate but fantasies come wit these
Just to sacrifice the taste of makin' cheese
You wanna be a rap superstar in the biz
And take shit from people who don't know what it is
I wish it was all fun and games
But the price of fame is high
And some can't pay to play
Trapped in what you rappin' about
Tell me what happened when you lost clout
The rout you took started collapsing
No fans, no fame, no respect
No change, no women, and everyone shits on your name
So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large, a big house five cars the rent charged
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large, a big house five cars the rent charged
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
When you sign to a record label
You don't know just signed your life over
And these whiteboys don't care about you
'Cause the minute you fall off
They'll find another Noreaga
And they'll find another Capone 'n' Noreaga
And they'll find another B Real
So you need to just keep stack your chips up
Do what you gotta do while you hot?
And mafuckin' get out the game
This isn't the drug game
It's even worse
Because in the drug game
Because if someone jerks you
You can shoot 'em and kill 'em
But in this game if someone jerks you
You gotta be humble
So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large, a big house five cars the rent charged
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large, a big house five cars the rent charged
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
My own son don't know me
Sittin' up in the hotel room lonley
But I thank god I'm wit my homies
But sometimes I wish I was back home
But only no radio or videos
'Cause they show me no love
The phony gotta hit the road slowly
So the record gets pushed by Sony
I'm in the middle like monie
And the press say that
My own people disowned me
And the best way back
Is to keep your head straight
Never inflate the cranium
Your crew worried about them honies at the paladium
Who just wanna cling on swing on
And so on and go on and fall off
The hoes fall off
To the next rap superstar
Wit no shame give him a year
And they'll be right out the game
The same as the last one
Who came before him
Gained fame started gettin' ignored
I warned him, assured him
This ain't easy take it from weezy
Sleezy people wanna be cheesey
They're fuckin' evil
So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large, a big house five cars the rent charged
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large, a big house five cars the rent charged
