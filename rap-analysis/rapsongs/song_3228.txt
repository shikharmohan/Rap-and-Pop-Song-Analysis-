With power, comes money
With money, comes greed
Now, if the greenbacks don't stack large on my side of the yard
I ain't fuckin' with it, this cake has got to be all icing, baby
Now I know, I'm taking the biggest piece but goddamn, I'm the biggest fish With the biggest mouth, bitch, you wanna be rich right?
Well, stick with me, do as I does and be as I be
We be stackin' chips, packin' clips, mackin' chicks
Laugh at tits, slappin' dick in yo' bitch
Makin' hoes, take these clothes, from these sto's
Walkin' slow, there go the po', now here we go
Parking lot to the spot, Marriott
'Cause what I got to make a knot, is very hot
Who's at the do'?, Go and check, I got the Tec
Tell him that you soakin' wet until he jet
Now lift up your fuckin' dress, where's the rest?
Bitch can hide a treasure chest in her breasts
Uh huh strip search, whip skirts
Uh huh shit hurts, but it works, bitch
You can jerk niggaz but you can't jerk me
Hoe, I only tell you once that this dick ain't free
I'm talkin' greed
Greed, give me everything that I need
How you gon' deal with the niggaz that I feed?
Greed, give me everything that I need
How you gon' deal with the niggaz that I feed?
We smokin' weed, you and me
Lookin' for that currency
We smokin' weed, you and me
Lookin' for that currency
Now bitch, niggaz don't mean shit from where I sit
Magnificent blow your back out if you act out
Eighteen deep when the plane soar
The bitch threw her tits, asked my click who we play fo'
Penetrate the clouds, loud and obnoxious
Surround the airport with feds and helicopters
Escorted, detained and deported
Scared of the lyrics and when they bitches hear us
We the clearest, you can fear us
Smile on the day of your disappearance, smoke in mirrors
Break 'em all, pull over and jump out
'Cause I can take 'em all, all bustas shake 'em all
I'm at the mall, buyin' shit like hot dog on a stick
These bitches all on the dick
Ice Cube ain't a lick make me bleed
And now you got to deal with the niggaz that I feed, greed
Uhh uhh uhh, give me more
Give me more greed, greed
When you get your hands on it, wanna fawn it
Wanna dance on it, everybody want it
When you get your hands on it, wanna fawn it
Wanna dance on it, everybody want it
You punks is petty, still we steady, countin' fetti
I'm the one closin' escrow, with the best flow
Do you wear a vest? No
Niggaz hit me I'ma turn into The Crow
And take a shit on everything counterfeit, the Don Mega
Blade Runner in a beige Hummer all summer
It'd take about twelve honkeys to convict
The nigga makin' you sick ask the 12 Monkeys
Up in Detroit holdin' Weed court, all through the South
Picked up a ounce in Shreveport
My lead give head tunnels
To any motherfucker disgruntled exit wound, look like a funnel
Worldwide, international jet set
My niggaz love fuckin' bitches that they just met
Get it wet and you can do anything
When I'm in Paris, niggaz, french-kiss the pinky ring
Greed, give me everything that I need
How you gon' deal with the niggaz that I feed?
Greed, give me everything that I need
How you gon' deal with the niggaz that I feed?
We smokin' weed, you and me
Lookin' for that currency
We smokin' weed, you and me
Lookin' for that currency
Yeah, Ice Cube, trillionaire, I own a mansion and a yacht
We do it like it should be does
Yeah, Westside niggaz is very greedy, uhh
Death Row is very greedy
Sic Wid It records is very greedy
Dangerous Music greedy, greedy, greedy
Ruthless Records greedy, Suave House, greedy
So So Def, greedy, Rap A Lot, greedy as fuck
No Limit, hella greedy

Hey, got twenties on my BM, you still fuckin' with a GM
