Emergin' to the right to the left, see three, hallucinatin'
Stoned ain't got a lick but a bra protection on my phone
Therefore that'll make it this that much easier
For anybody with a computer that got the right data information
Software to clone, clone it off the streets how much?
Bass head dis down playa price boy a hundred piece
(Hundred piece)

Before he get to askin' me and if he ask me for ID

To use some of that swindlin' ass fast-fast talkin'
Con man [Incomprehensible] in the ghetto urban reverse psychology
Niggaz got it tough out here, tough out here, it's rough
Niggaz got it rough out here, nigga out here, it's tough

Pussy fallin' all out of my Granada
Squabs in Kansas City, squabs in Colorado
Learned how to pop my collar in the city where they shot The Mack

On the dope track where the bass heads be comin' through
I see more killings and more hop than the kangaroo
My baby's momma she sick, she on that glass dick
Be crawlin' all on the rug lookin' for that shit
Hogan High School prom queen right?
On her hands and knees pickin' up lint and anything that's white
That's how you can tell that a dope fiend's gone psycho
When they get to hah lookin' all out the curtains with they high beams
On the corner, be that dice game unfoldin'
(What happened?)
One of my dudes, seriously, he rollin'
Then a couple of fools pull up and went for theirs a-course
With intentions of splittin' my wig but it wound up gettin' reversed
I left they kite flyin', down for the grind, witnesses dissolve
(Dissolve)
A prime example of bad karma, Murphy's Law
(Murphy's Law)
If you gon' be a fool then be a fool, shit
But just know when to act a fool and who to act a fool with
