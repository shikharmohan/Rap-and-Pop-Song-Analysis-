Let cho' mind not be confused
If you can walk this walk, nigga take my shoes
New fools, you fools, these fools, all y'll
Talkin' bad about me and my motherfuckin' dawg
He ain't trippin', I ain't trippin' but y'll niggaz still dissin'
To me some of these suckers'll never get it
Full clip and if I miss it I'ma tip it on the Crip
And Dogg House in your mouth, now tell me how you livin'
Who the villain, you the villain? Nigga Ren is 'The Villain'
My homey from the C-P-T, cold chillin'
Now as time flies by I see the game gettin' mo' reala
As I get mo' scrilla, can you dig it?
I always tend to come widdit
Gravy train on your brain, nigga come get it
I'm too young to retire, I'm havin' fun wit it
See when you learn what to do with it, I'll be done with it, come with it
Go, just go away, go away, niggaz can't be trusted
Just come back another day, niggaz be on bitch shit
Just go far away, niggaz get it twisted
Just go away
Now she said she don't like a G
Well listen here bitch, get the fuck from 'round me
You thought you was bout to get a drink on me?
I put hands on you bitch like Sugar Free
I always let a bitch know her boundaries
Same with a nigga, I treat him like a flea
You claim to be, you aim to be in my spot
Motherfucker, you will get popped, blaow
Not knowin' who you fuckin' wit niggaz be on bitch shit
Nigga we be fuckin' quick, nigga we ain't talkin' shit
When the heat speak, niggaz be on bitch shit
Tryin' to get somewhere, coverin' up they biscuit
And then he in the club, all up on my dilznick
But when I leave, you niggaz pullin' trick shit
But it's cool 'cause niggaz gonna miss this
'Cause I'ma keep it all business, what is this?
Go, just go away, go away, niggaz can't be trusted
Just come back another day, niggaz be on bitch shit
Just go far away, niggaz get it twisted
Just go away
I said let yo' mind not be confused
If you can walk this walk, nigga take my shoes
New fools, you fools, these fools, all y'll
Talkin' bad about me and my motherfuckin' dawg
He ain't trippin', I ain't trippin' but y'll niggaz still dissin'
To me some of these suckers'll never get it
