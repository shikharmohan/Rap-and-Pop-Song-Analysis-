Woah, stay, stay, stay
Daisy, daisy
I love daisies, I love daisies
I love pushin' up your favorite daisies
Daisy
This is Posdnuos
The president of a paragraph
Paragraph, president
President preachin' 'bout the on-tech
Known for the new step
Stop and take a bow
Amityville resident
Resident supported by the speaker view
Want to feel it in your shoe
Let me show you how
Platform, witnesses
Witnesses, show you to my show-lab
Fill you with my vocab
Hope you have a spoon
Discuss contracts
You like the way I vocalize
And bring it to a compromise
My P.A. won't set up till noon
It's a D.A.I.S.Y. age
Sun, ceilin'
Ceilin' connects to the sun
Burnin' inside everyone
On a side, plug-a-fied sire
One million
Demonstrations have been heard
My hair burns when I'm referred
Kid shouts, my roof is on fire
Go dancin'
Dancin' like a bandit
Psychics try to stand it
Keep it up until they burn a cell
Romancin'
Romancin' dialect in shows
Posdnuos creatin' flow
You say you didn't know
Oh well, it's a D.A.I.S.Y. age
Pedal, promenade
Promenade people to the providence
Dove will show dominance
Inside of every phrase
Rebel, renegade
Renegade reachin' only topflight
Can't find your new height
Think you need a raise
Dialect, ultimate
Ultimate strings from the soul stuff
Copies always stayin' rough
Before they go to plate
Try a pack, it'll stick
Stick to you but won't deflate
Keepin' all the levels straight
I tell you, mate that we're top rate
'Cause it's a D.A.I.S.Y. age
The speak, motor
Motor is the heartbeat
Sleepin' in your car seat
Kept alive to every mile discovered
Complete quota
Quota sharp at 12 noon
Risen to a new tune
Positive is greater than the others
Image, mirror
Mirror image don't contend
Vocals should be comprehended
Silver audience'll say what's said
Scrimmage, nearer
Nearer to the goal line
Forget about the Rose Wine
The Soul will let you know it's time
And it's a D.A.I.S.Y. age
La la la la, lah
This is a D.A.I.S.Y. age
La la la la, lah
This is a D.A.I.S.Y. age
La la la la, lah
This is a D.A.I.S.Y. age
La la la la, lah
This is a D.A.I.S.Y. age
This is a D.A.I.S.Y. age
This is a D.A.I.S.Y. age
This is a D.A.I.S.Y. age
This is a D.A.I.S.Y. age
La la la la, lah
This is a D.A.I.S.Y. age
La la la la, lah
This is a D.A.I.S.Y. age
Sing about the D.A.I.S.Y. age
Sing about the D.A.I.S.Y. age
Sing about the D.A.I.S.Y. age
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, rain on a daisy
Let it rain on a daisy
Let it rain on a daisy
Rain on, rain on
Oh yes, I can understand
