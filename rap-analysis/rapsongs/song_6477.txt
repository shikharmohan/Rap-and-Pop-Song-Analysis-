[verse 1]
She steady tellin' me her dude ain't the type she like
And the reason she ain't leavin' is cause he's so nice
Oh Due to special occasions like birthday shit
Unless she's just in need for some birthday dick
You can spend it with your man y'all can walk them malls
Tear that motherfucker down I just want your draws
That's why I'm laughing everytime you call
cause I know that you're in love with how I broke it off
The nigga strokes too soft and she a beast in bed
And when she fucks she talks pussy is deep and wet
And I don't need to text I don't sweat the bitch
And she don't understand but that's some Texas shit
and I won't fuck's em on the first day, I peeps they mind
So they know that what they havin be more important than mine
And when I'm deep inside with speed devine 
I moans and groans she scream and whines, which means that IÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½m...
Chrous (girl screamin in the background)
Makin you hit the high notes (she hittinÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ the high note)
Makin you hit the high notes (hey you hittinÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ the high note baby)
Makin you hit the high notes
(I can makin you hit the high note)
[Verse 2]
Fuck doing dinner and the movie going out with broads
Make it look like we a couple when it's not at all
How it is in actuality and close your mouth
We do better gettin' drinks at Davenport's and talkin
I'm just sayin since you got a man it's probably not
In the end will suck us both if someone sees us out
And even if we are just friends that don't justify
You being seeing with a boy like him
cause boy that's bad and they know before it's over
You be bent over my sofa while I bust that ass
And while that nigga takin' pictures of you buyin you clothes
Sendin roses to your office while he's crying his soul
Stuck wonderin why you left him out in the cold
Cause she was swappin with your business that somebody done told
It was probably a hoe, probably somebody you know
On your cell phone dialin while you hittin' that note
Now we squeezin her throat... 
Chorus
[verse 3]
If she a hoe in the beginning then she's a hoe for life
And I can't understand how niggaz make these hoes they wife
You got hoes that's filipino you got hoes that's white
You got hoes from Puerto Rico that's just cold as ice
And it is what it is ain't no changin' the facts
It was a shame when you only thought they came in black
Now how insane is that, had a change of heart
Though you had the world then it came apart
Then she hangs in bars you need to tame your broad
Said until she met him she never came this hard
And the sham'nest part while you at home relax
I make her eyes, tryin to brake her motherfuckin back
On the balcony bent over lookin bad as hell
Finger fuckin her and slappin on that ass as well
See then inhales that long exhale, and then you hear
The sounds of an orgasmic yells, yeah I was...
