I was swervin' thru Queens fully grown Benz
Searchin' for the butta through my Cartier lense system
Bangin' out nothin' but the blends on the digital startec
Rappin' to my mens
Then spotted the most exotic cheekiness half Rachel half Holly
My [Incompherensible]  is
The slow mo crept up nice and slow
Breathin' on my ice so it shine real nice
Crease my scar piece laid back in my seat
Right near Bazely projects on the back streets
Her name was Keisha full of street knowledge
Pumped a little trees but she planned to go to college
Starin' at my ice smellin' my cologne
She lived on the southside so bring things on
Honey got flavor and it just don't stop
Does she want me for me or me for my rocks?
You're car make me hot hot hot
You just make me just hot hot hot
I like you're rocks rocks rocks
They make me hot hot hot
Baby boy don't stop stop stop
You keep me hot hot hot
I'm a take you for all you've got
Baby girl just stop stop stop
Check this out
She slid up my whip like the Queen of New York
We jetted to city island to eat shrimp and talk
Sourced up my keys to the valet cat
I glanced at the fatty I'm a see about that
We blazed in the spizza like Bonnie and Clyde Scooby Dooby hizza
I'm feelin' the vibe cop the blue for some video type
Knowin' all along how hot these kind of nights get
I've got her right where I want her reality about to creep up on her
Stroke her softly gently with my G while the light reflects off my ICP
Waiter ice the crystal let it simmer
Lights too bright here's a grand make them dimmer
I kept frontin' and I just couldn't stop
I don't mind spendin' paper when it's lookin' that hot
You're car makes me hot hot hot
You just make me just hot hot hot
I like you're rocks rocks rocks
They make me hot hot hot
Baby boy don't stop stop stop
You keep me hot hot hot
I'll take you for all you've got
Baby girl just stop stop stop
Check yourself
You burst out of semi [Incomprehensible]
she pulled down the straps to her dress
Reached in the Prada sparked up bangin'
Some Wu Tang feelin' the [Incomprehenisble]
She said "Now would you wanna sell your soul for chips
And give up girl to push whips?"
Never miss some spiritual down to my bone
Why you takin' jumbo in that zone
She said "I would do anything for [Incomprehensible]
Take off my [Incomprehensible] drop to my knees
Talkin' in my face breath smellin' like cheese
I asked her, "Shorty you degrade yourself"
Just to throw a little bit of ice on the shelf you turnin' me off I can't lie
Keisha said, "Why?"
I said, "Yo, how can a man respect that, knowin' if he paid"
Then he correct that ice is the price for an overnight wife
A true shark caller don't want that in his life
So all you that are sellin' you're souls
You need to put your hooker vibes on hold
As for Keisha she workin' on the stroll
Dead ass broke but her pimp the man grow
You're car makes me hot hot hot
You just make me hot hot hot
I like you're rocks rocks rocks
They make me hot hot hot
Baby boy don't stop stop stop
You keep me hot hot hot
I'm a take you for all you've got
Baby girl just stop stop stop
Check yourself
You're car makes me hot hot hot

I'm a take you for all you've got
Baby girl just stop stop stop
Check yourself
You're car makes me hot hot hot
You just make me hot hot hot

They make me hot hot hot
