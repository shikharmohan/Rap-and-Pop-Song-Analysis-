Flirt wit the hood rats then pop models
Start with straight shots and then pop bottles
Flirt wit the hood rats then pop models
Okay we poppin' champagne like we won a championship game

Okay, start with straight shots and then pop bottles

Straight up out the water wit my Mark Jacob's goggles

No I wouldn't take ya girl but I shall take her tongue from her
Could you tell I'm in love woman, like no other woman?
Oh I'm sorry sweetheart, I thought you were my other woman

Now as I recline behind my desk
I ain't got a lot of Nikes, but I got a lot of cheques, money
Got my own shoe, brand new on the set
Went from sittin' in a cell to sittin' on a jet
From sh***** in a cell to sh***** on a jet
I lost too many friends but I won too many bets
I made too much money I ain't made enough yet
So I scratch, and yes Junior is the best, shawty
So many ****** throw my hood on they back
So many ****** from ya hood on they back
That's why we so paid and it be like that
I rather pop a bottle, befo I pop a ***
Start with straight shots and then pop bottles
Flirt wit the hood rats then pop models

Yea, only sippin' red champagne
White tee, red hat, red bandanna
Uptown, choppers ****** upon ya
******* wit the Birdman we choppin' yo propane
******* wit my son and we run up in ya mansion
Chopper make music, ***** start dancin'
Stunna man back, so you know the circumstances
And I'm cookin' up the Carter 3 no advances
All my cars automative, automatic
No lie, we don't even drive no askin'
Uptown, we packin' and we stackin'
Young Money, Cash Money we the champion
Start with straight shots and then pop bottles
Flirt wit the hood rats then pop models
