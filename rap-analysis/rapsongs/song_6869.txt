It's been eighteen years since, I've seen you on the streets
You're up for parole heard the word this week
My cousin, Flip come at home damn it's been so long
Keep ya eyes on the prize, homie keep ya head strong
Seen in your packages, kite keep you straight
Deep in this caleseri, fat 'till it date
So we can chop it up, so we can spread the ice and
The ties of no g's is for sure, you know I like it
This is a D.P.G. dedication
Is for my homies on parole or probation
And you can catch the case homie on vacations
It's for the rainy or so you just bang
To my young homeboy, who ain't never gettn' out
Here's a record for you homie, 'cause I know you got caught
One love, East Side, that's how we do ride
D.P.G.C. we do or die
Oh yes we're fresh to death, nonetheless
When we was out, we was rockin', yes
But guess what? Now we rockin' Snoop Dogg clothin'
And every nigga in the click straight rollin'
I hope that we can be, be together real soon
I hope that we can be, be together real soon
(Real soon )
Just a little bit of game ain't a damn thang
Let the heat around, bang, dogg pound gang swang
Why with me, let me show ya how D.P. do G.C. that
That's Kurupt, Nate, Snoop, the homies might flash
Kick, pack, send it 'bout five above and pass
All I wanna do is D.P.G.
And keep it like that and hit donuts in the streets
Bump it gettn' da high to the one two step
Make the whole spot stop, been hittn' the ball next
Me and Darren ridin' side by side
Nate and Snoop ridin' one in front from behind
To my young homeboy, who ain't never gettn' out
Here's a record for you homie, 'cause I know you got caught
One love, East Side, that's how we do ride
D.P.G.C. we do or die
Oh yes we're fresh to death, nonetheless
When we was out, we was rockin', yes
But guess what? Now we rockin' Snoop Dogg clothin'
And every nigga in the click straight rollin'
I hope that we can be, be together real soon
I hope that we can be, be together real soon
(Real soon )
Out up on the streets tryn' come on up
Got caught sleepin' and got cut the hell up
Just tryn' to make some money hit my ride
Cheddar for my baby then live right
Got me a room and a couple of rocks
Raised on the street, yes, the school of hard knocks
Nigga better pay me, ready or not
Findin' dead bodies all on your block
Nigga gotta get paid and that's on the real
Broke,wanna smoke, then you know how I feel
I miss the real gangsta's and that's on the real
Got blacked up while chasing the squeal
To my young homeboy, who ain't never gettn' out
Here's a record for you homie, 'cause I know you got caught
One love, East Side, that's how we do ride
D.P.G.C, we do or die
Oh yes we're fresh to death, nonetheless
When we was out, we was rockin', yes
But guess what?, Now we rockin' Snoop Dogg clothin'
And every nigga in the click straight rollin'
I hope that we can be, be together real soon
I hope that we can be, be together real soon
(Real soon )
