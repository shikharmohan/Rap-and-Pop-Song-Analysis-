Prodigy 
Yo my rap taste good in my mouth like Deer Park 
For your ears to list this 
You don't wanna miss this dun 
Don't be a statistic 
Keep your rhymes to yourself we make fools out of niggas 
And write shit that would certainly move ya'll niggas 
PEACE to my summer villains with pink houses 
From Red Hook to QB you know the routine 
We need a movie to show how our life is so ill 
Every Summer in the projects we partied on the benches 
Few gallons of gin and pepsi 
Remember Party wars, that was back in like 90 
We use to roll o-wees now we stuff dutches 
Kids rushing, whats your discussion 
Ya'll niggas talk alot of shit heard you on your tape fronting 
I fake nothing, Fuck around and push the wrong button 
I dedicate my days to seeing your drip blood 
I will always love Gambino and ScarFace 
Killa Black no man can fill your shoes, Now whats bad news 
It couldn't get no worse, So what ya'll niggas know about the turmoil 
What ya know about your blood soil, Clothes and little Ho's 
And the legs of pant slugs that crack the shin bone 
The Other shot blasts through your left clavical 
Melt swizz suits and paint the avenue's 
Havoc 
How you want it? Bent Scheme or straight blunted 
Many are rare, rore, Havoc has just over done it 
While you sitting there whispering like a little girl 
Fuck, waiting around till the dutchy gets twirled 
We going at you, not cause we want to but cause we have to 
To avoid the situation that you couldn't last through 
If I can't have it at all I don't want it at all 
Off top serious dogg, I'm out for the raw 
Back to the world, the shit that I kick will dazzle your girl 
Handle your bitch, can't then take her for pearl 
Get him with the pink slip, get him bent to he hurl 
Hennessy got my mind locked, tight in a curl 
Hold it down like Saddam you can't search my click 
Even with dirty worms I'm gonna still appear 
How you want it, bent scheme or straight blunted (2x) 
Cormega 
Yo, my pen is sick like a heroin add-dict, Whenever Mega spits 
Exhale preciseness, Drug Dealer Ghetto shit 
Sweat in my hand, plus the finger numb from mesasuring grams 
Gun on my waist, In case I see son 
who wetted my man 
I be Gortexing to death, rocking ice with special fx's 
Obvious I was destined to rep 
Yo my persona is the drama, my Infamous Congrommalits 
Considered mad real, niggas feel the Montana shit 
Born official, my niggas that are gone I miss you 
I shed a tear, see ya'll niggas when I get there 
Yo my dun did six years and still didn't hit the strip 
I'm waiting on the day, when Rikers Island ciphers are incomplete 
When I can sleep with no heat, hidden beneath the sheet 
And I can relax with my air max, appearing on my feet 
When I rhyme you enter my mind, Seeing nigga's lead to excellence 
I represented then manifested in the beat....Respect this 
Like a lexus jeep 
My technique 
Leaves my enimies stretched for weeks, vexed from me 
Especially they know my destiny, man they scared to death of me 
Can't even question me, I serve them like stretching ki's..please 
Havoc
