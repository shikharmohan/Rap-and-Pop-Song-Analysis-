If I can't have anybody else but you
Baby, don't you know what you put me through
I don't want anybody else it's true
No one does it better than you
Didn't you know, that I wanted you to call
Tell me what's on your mind baby
Maybe you don't want my love at all
I thought, I deserved more than that
I'll give you all the love that I can
I know what I've gotta do
Gotta get through to you
And make you understand baby
If I can't have anybody else but you
Baby don't you know what you put me through
I don't want anybody else it's true
No one does it better than you
Now if you wanna ride, all night
I'm waiting come inside
But if you wanna go, lemme know
Don't lead me on, don't waste my time
I think, I deserve more than that
I've given you all that I can
I know what I've gotta do
I gotta get through to you
And make you understand baby
If I can't have anybody else but you
Baby, don't you know what you put me through
I don't want anybody else it's true
No one does it better than you
If I can't have anybody else but you
Baby, don't you know what you put me through
I don't want anybody else it's true
No one does it better than you
Anybody, anybody
And baby, in my dreams I make love to you
And I'll do everything that you wanna do
Don't even think that I'm not the man
I'll go crazy, you drive me insane
No one does it better than you
If I can't have anybody else but you
Baby, don't you know what you put me through
I don't want anybody else it's true
No one does it better than you
If I can't have anybody else but you
Baby, don't you know what you put me through
I don't want anybody else it's true
No one does it better than you
If I can't have anybody else but you
Baby, don't you know what you put me through
I don't want anybody else it's true
No one does it better than you
No one does it better than you
