Hold up, smoke somethin' bitch, uh, uh
Everybody want to know why the airplane was late
I was waitin' for whitey to get my fuckin' paper straight
I'm an Underground King, nigga let my nuts hang, nigga
Sayin' I'm only in [Incomprehensible], ain't no thang
Nigga, everybody rappin' like they ballin' and they rich
I see 'em in the streets, I ain't believin' that shit
They diamonds ain't shinin' and they Rolex ain't real
While I'm grippin' on the grain, sippin' lean and poppin' pills
Fuck how them bitches feel, I'm workin' wood wheel
In a 2000 Seville, your step daddy can get killed
If he keeps talkin' shit, ain't no thang to get hit
On your video you trill, on your record you tryin' to diss
But everywhere we go, we represent the South
For them niggas and them girls with them golds in they mouth
The boys with them P's and O's in they house
It's all about the trill, bitch you ain't what this about, about
When you see me on the street, nigga don't say shit
Blowin' big on the sweep, nigga don't say shit
Everybody want the ice and everybody want to ball
But everybody ain't trill so we ain't fuckin' with y'all
When I see you at the show, nigga don't say shit
Actin' bad with ya ho, nigga don't say shit
Everybody want the ice and everybody want to ball
But everybody ain't trill so we ain't fuckin' with y'all
Say, nigga ain't got shit to hide, I ain't got nothin' to prove
We ain't got nothin' to gain but I got everythin' to lose
So I'm forever bring the blues to the issue
Pick and choose if I miss ya, stick and move when I diss ya
Disapprove we can get ya and your bullshit, I be the same
The game will never be the same, it was made for me to gain
You see the thangs for me to name I go by, so fly, oh my
Flow fly, dope my, wait awhile you know why? Why?
Too many niggas pop collars and drop dollars, baby ballin'
Bullshitter, frontin' like rottweiliers, no bark, no bite
But showin' thangs, talkin' loud like they knowin' thangs
I'm from Texas nigga, all we do is blow them thangs
Fuck your clique, your corner, your city, your last name
Stuck in the fast lane, [Incomprehensible] your ass mane
Bask at the light, blast at the day, blast at the night
Got your ass in a fight, it ain't no passin' tonight
When you see me on the street, nigga don't say shit
Blowin' big on the sweep, nigga don't say shit
Everybody want the ice and everybody want to ball
But everybody ain't trill so we ain't fuckin' with y'all
When I see you at the show, nigga don't say shit
Actin' bad with ya ho, nigga don't say shit
Everybody want the ice and everybody want to ball
But everybody ain't trill so we ain't fuckin' with y'all
People waitin', some be hatin', I'll be shakin', they'll be fakin'
Waitin' for me to fall but yet they comin' off the wall
Till I'm ready, keep the gun steady and ready
For anybody crossin' the line with get that fuck shit
I got a [Incomprehensible], got a hoe, got a trunk with the funk
Got the radio on pump when I come through a slump
Remember me, The one that had your back up in the club
Remember me, The one that bring you on and show you love
Remember me, The one that rolled by deep in a Cadillina
With a rusty ass niner lookin' for trouble
So what? I know the same streets you know
Yeah, so what? I go the same places you go
I got the mark in my skin so you know my set
I'm the heart, you the place, I'm always first, you always late
I'm the king in these streets till the muthafuckin' end
So you fuck with me, you gotta fuck with my friend
When you see me on the street, nigga don't say shit
Blowin' big on the sweep, nigga don't say shit
Everybody want the ice and everybody want to ball
But everybody ain't trill so we ain't fuckin' with y'all
When I see you at the show, nigga don't say shit
Actin' bad with ya ho, nigga don't say shit
Everybody want the ice and everybody want to ball
But everybody ain't trill so we ain't fuckin' with y'all
When you see me on the street, nigga
And when I see at the show, nigga
And when I blowin' on the sweep, nigga
And when I cookin' with ya ho, nigga don't say shit
