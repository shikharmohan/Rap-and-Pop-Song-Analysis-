nigga feel that beat in your chest when you leanin n swirvin,
bass in your back you feel it you heard it,
hand on the wheel no need to be nervous,
ride wit a G everything will be perfect,
put it down put it all on the surface,
thuggin if you ride it'll all be worth it,
til the wheels fall off,
nigga thats the purpose,
nothin but the best cuz we deserve it,
they know when i'm comin,
cuz niggas can hear me before they can see me,
and they can't believe it cuz im bumpin Easy E,
and they just seen me on TV,
navigatin through the streets dog,
keep it real the beat that ain't no secret,
jump outta the G car,
run up and the liquors gon' hit the freezer,
grab a old gold like my 4-0,
my flow so cold i gotta have some,
turn the music back up to the maximum,
niggas hatin on us better laugh at em,
I got a 9mm that'll get me to the trunk, 
if i make it to the trunk ima pop that trunk,
ya'll ready know comin outta the trunk is an AK,
who wanna get get hit? what.
CHORUS
