For my dogs in the pen, my niggaz hold your head
For my dirties on the block, come up any way you can
For my homies in the street game, trying to get ahead
For homeless people sleepin' on the sidewalks for beds
To the babies, born already on dope
Straight to his veins from the Coast Guard boat
Baby daddies and if you late you can't participate
Baby mommas, I know what you going through
So sorry to disappoint you
Ghetto children you're the spark, you're the energy, you're the heart
To the granma's, you're the glue 'cause you know things fall apart
To the PP's, the POW's, MIA's
To to AR's, to the HK's, to the M1's, to the AK's
To the comrades on the grind
Let me see who comes to mind
To my clic, to stic
Oh yeah I can't forget
What up Tahim? What up Abu?
What up Common? What up Badu?
Jermaine, Dem, and Dee-Don
We 'bout to get our freak on
That's F R double E on
In case you didn't hear me, hear me, hear me
Oh oh oh, oh oh
