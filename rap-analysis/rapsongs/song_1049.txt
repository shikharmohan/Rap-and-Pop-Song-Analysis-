Everyone hides their face, sets behind a mask they wear
Jimi was a rock star searching for that magic place
That he could touch in the sky just to get his people high
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(Jack)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Jack)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(Jack)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Jack)
Life is so, colorful reds, blues and dreams
Jimi lives in a purple haze, in a psychedelic maze
Playing the streets like and instrument
Pulling strings wherever he went
Angel sent from the sky just to get his people high
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(Jack)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Jack)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(Jack)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Jack)
Women all around
(Ehh, da, da, daaa, da)
Fast cars and sound
(Ehh, da, da, daaa, da)
And freedom he was bound
(Ehh, da, da, daaa, da)
Couldn't see the ground
(Ehh, da, da, daaa, da)
Jimi come out why don't you set me free?
(Set me free)
So high born to fly
Getting high off his own supply [unverified]
Everybody follows the same Lord
Using his light to guide the way [unverified]
[Unverified] try things but few die so young
Something among Jimi was stung
Everyone  hides their face
Sets behind a mask they wear
Jimi come out, why don't you set me free?
Jimi come out, why don't you set me free?
Jimi come out, why don't you set me free?
