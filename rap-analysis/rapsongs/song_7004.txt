Lauryn: Brethren dont cut me when i'm going.  I dont hear myself.  We bout to drop, drop drop drop.  You can bring the beat up a little bit in the headphones.  Bring the beat up a little bit. We bout to drop.  We bout to drop, drop, drop, drop.
L-Boogie: 
I got moxy, I'm so d**n foxy 
Industry try to block me like cops and paparazzi 
Full stop, Don't copy, Just cop me properly
Everybody same policy, universal equality 
Responsibility, polity, to survive economically
Some people do it comically, Fruits of freedom, equality
Invest your money properly,  people own me apology 
Intellectual property, stealing stolen commodity 
Souls searching or controlling and robbery, Cold lack of comradere
Clones, Copy-cats bother me, Mine, Own, Blind cats, follow me
Honesty, honesty, honestly, all these jokes are common-league 
Puppets with no autonomy 
Yup Its Fugees Entirely
Chorus 
I see you looking but you better take it easy 
Tell your crew I said tell em take it easy 
Here's come the rocket launcher, you better take it easy, take it easy, take it easy 
(Lauryn: too sleazy) 
Too much ex mami, take it easy 
Good with the sex mami, you'll be like, take it easy 
Ay papi, better take it easy, take is easy, take it easy 
Clef: 
You movin bricks but you better take it easy 
Here's a tip, you're too flashy 
I don't tip twice, but you best friend he DT
And that dog sniffin in the back ain't Lassie 
And I ain't rhymed in a minute, but ya'll ain't catch up 
And that ain't blood on your shirt, man that's ketchup (That's ketchup) 
Picture Clef getting a writer to give him help 
I'd rather kill myself become a ghost and write for myself (OH MY GOD!!)(***see C) 
Cuss I'm the top celebrity, top celebrity, top celebrity, MC (Bing!) 
I flow for the thugs, gypsies, and hippies (Bing!) 
A ghetto maestro with a Nat Turner flow (Bing!) 
Malcolm X come out, hit the Klu Kulx Show (SHOOWOOWOO) 
Chorus 
I see you looking but you better take it easy 
Tell your goons that they better take it easy 
Here's come the rocket launcher, take it easy, take it easy, you better take it easy (Lauryn: too sleazy) 
Too much ex mami, take it easy 
Good with the sex you'll be like take it easy 
Ay papi, mami take it easy, take is easy, you better take it easy 
L-Boogie: 
Don't you know 
originals get plagerized, majors minors, must supervise 
Haters, Climbers get scrutinized, Placaters, Blind and stupid guys
Wicked people choose homicide, Dregs of society heathen dem
Beggars, bogus misleading dem, Nigra, Negro, Negrito dem
Angelitos con libre dem, Chico's, Chica's completing them
Addiction, fiction, bleeding them, capitalism eating them, 
Misunderstanding cheatin them, The ignorance defeating them
True loyalty is leaving them, got royalty believing them 
Eyes open deceiving them, Reconciling, Receiving them
Reckless driving and grieving them, Matthew Andrew and Peter them
(Slow down) 
We bout to reconcile (repeat) 
We bout to reconcile (reconcile) 
We bout to reconcile(recon, recon, reconcile) 
We bout to reconcile, (tell em to give off my style) (Slow Down) 
We bout to reconcile (reconcile like Public Enemy) 
We bout to reconcile (Slow Down) (reconciliation) (tell em to get off my style) 
We bout to reconcile(running with my crew again) 
We bout to reconcile (Slow Down) (tell them to get my off style) (repeat) 
Pras: 
Stop the track, what ya'll thought I wasn't coming 
been in the L.A., few flicks, few millions 
back with the Fugees, foo-fighting for a few billions 
dub plate dealing, sound boy killin 
anything we do, we want that cap for me realin? 
Angelo, Simone, Michelle, you know them willin, 
Can't fight the feelin, when I pull in the SFR, every girl love's a ghetto superstar (that's Pras baby) 
Run hip hop like pin stripe Lees and 
I got love for my crew like Big had for Cease (C's) 
Pull and sqeeze on these MC's, 
I don't really wanna do it, take it easy 
I see you looking but you better take it easy 
Tell your goons that they better take it easy 
Here's come the rocket launcher, take it easy, take it easy, you better take it easy (Lauryn: too sleazy) 
Too much ex mami, take it easy 
Good with the sex you'll be like take it easy 
Ay papi, mami take it easy, take is easy, you better take it easy 
We got L-Boogie in the house (Lauryn: what) 
Prazwell in the house, 
Clef, 
Jerry Wonder, yeah 
Big Ro (Rohan) I see you in the back
Let's get this thing started 
Let's stay focused, focused, focused, focused 
Oh, If you don't know what's goin on man
The Fugees back on the street, serious thing right now 
You scared yet, ah pack your dibby dibby dub box
