OMG
California Air
Chain all blue like it's runnin out of air
I keep a bad bitch with a fat derriere
and u know that hoe fresher than a new pair
Retro elevens on the pedal
I'm taking this to the next level
Competition best to dress up in a Chevelle
And if you niggas still wanna make a deal with the devil
I can help you meet him, introduce you to my barrel.
All you artists walkin round with yo wack raps (wack raps)
They gettin fucked by the game, Kat Stacks [x2]
And any nigga thinkin he can make it happen
I'll be outside of Staples with the bitches and phantom.
Mothafucka!
Chorus [x4]
Doughboy
Pull up on them bitches, steppin out on 30 inches
In my L.A. Dodger fitted, with some Louie V stichin
Niggas wanna catch me slippin, yeah they prayin and they wishin
Cuz a nigga clockin dough and i'm fuckin all they bitches
(Yo you fuckin all they bitches?) yeah im fuckin all they bitches
And it's money over bitches and I'm preachin my religion
Cuz this game that I'm livin, about as cold as my wrist is
If you know my paps, then you know I'm bout the business
Smoke big trees (big trees), Christmas [x2]
Chain supersix (supersix), Sickless [x2]

This games' a bitch watch me pimp it
Chorus [x2]

West Coast style baby, on some California shit
They might've told ya that, I was hard on the bitch
You know how it go, some bitches think they slick
Look at me and think they about to get rich (get rich)
Uh Ohh [x2], Danger [x2], You are [x2], A stranger

Chorus [x4]
What about me? [x3]
