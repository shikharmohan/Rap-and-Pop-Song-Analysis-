See we, we about to take it where
Wh-where it all started
We gonna take 'em back
Busta Rhymes now, flipmode now
My nigga Fingaz now
Check it, yo
Busta Bus is back in this bitch, holding the Rock
Puttin' all the pep all in your step
Now we controllin' the Rock
(Yeah my nigga)
See how we comin' be loadin' the docks
Floatin' and simply stockin' the goods
That we makin' you flop
(Ay yo)
See now we thicker and we be makin' you sicker
Stuck like a bumper sticker
From how we be dropping it quicker
For all these niggas
That be riding and whippin' in their truck
(Crash)
And buyin' another one and do not be givin' a fuck
(What)
Flipmode
(Yes)
'Cause we knowin' we comin' to get it
Gather around all my niggas who that be already to set it
(Set it)
Fuckin' and just break them off
Let the women just shake it off
Got them bouncin' to take it off for me, check it
I've been double dutchin' and dosey-doin' on music way before
A lot of these new niggas could figure then pattend all on my flow
Peep on how we coming to rip it and know we gonna wet ya
And rep for my niggas 'cause I'm coming to get ya, I said
Guess who's comin'?
With brand new fire to satisfy
All the people in the street when it drops
(Let's go)
Now let me see
All the people with me let me see your hands high
Let me know you up in the spot
(Ay yo I'm sayin')
Everytime we givin' you music
We give you the kind of music
That makes you bang it loud on your block
(C'mon c'mon)
This is to know when I'm comin'
I'm comin' to make you wyle out in the
Place that makes you get up and wanna hop
(Let's do it)
Go head and hop, go head and hop, go head and hop
We past makin' them bounce, go head and hop
C'mon just do it
Go head and hop baby
Now you know it we comin' to kill you niggas for shizzle
Makin' these bitches wanna shake it
And we just makin' them wiggle
Capitalizing off on the music that be we be keepin' coming
Have you niggas really spazing and blackend out in their stomach
(Hey bebe)
There's no mistakin' you know we makin' you bounce
Takin' the unforsaken approach the way we be takin' out
Scrapin' these niggas and breakin' their pockets to chase them out
Suddenly call your bitches to see just how they just makin' out
Fuck it, we kick the bucket and to continue to stake them out
(Ha)
And in back of the crib is where we will be makin' out
Puting some shit together make it so you could all attend
Welcoming you and my nigga then we can break your pocket again
(Oh Oh)
Niggas flossin' and tossin' their drinks
Like they all in the place
And leave the niggas the bonk
Until they catch one all up in their face
Y'all know we'll spray y'all niggas and know we gonna wet ya
And rep for my niggas 'cause we comin' to get ya, I said
Guess who's comin'?
With brand new fire to satisfy
All the people in the street when it drops
(Let's go)
Now let me see
All the people with me let me see your hands high
Let me know you up in the spot
(Ay yo I'm sayin')
Everytime we givin' you music
We give you the kind of music
That makes you bang it loud on your block
(C'mon c'mon)
This is to know when I'm comin'
I'm comin' to make you wyle out in the
Place that makes you get up and wanna hop
(Let's do it)
Go head and hop, go head and hop
We past makin' them bounce, go head and hop
(C'mon just do it)
Go head and hop baby
