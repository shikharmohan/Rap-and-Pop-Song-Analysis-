Uhhh
I'm yo special girl, yo real good girl
Biggest bitch in yo itty bitty world

Get my mind fucked up, and my heartbeat racin'
You can call me, your crafty honey
I don't give a fuck, as long as you give me the money
And if you ever violate this, call me a bitch

Mack it around, and do your little thing
