Mr. West is in the building 
swagger on a hundred thousand, trillion

I'm Christopher Columbus, y'all just the pilgrims 
Thanksgiving do we even gotta question 
Hermes Pastelle I pass the dressing 
My attitude is tattooed 
that means it's permanent, so I guess i should address it, huh? 
My swagger is mick jagger 
every time I breathe on the track I asthma attack it 
Why he's so mad for, why he gotta have it 
cuz I slaved my whole life, now I'm the master 
Na-Na-Na, How it feel to wake up and be the shit and the urine Na-na-na-na-na 
Trying to get that Kobe number, one over Jordan

No one on the corner gotta bop like this

No one on the corner gotta pocket like this 
so I rock Roc jeans cuz my knots so thick 
You can learn how to dress just by 
jocking my fresh 
jocking jocking my fresh 
jocking jocking my fresh 
Follow my steps, it's the road to success 
where the niggas know you thoro 
and the girls say yes 
But I can't teach you my swag 
you can pay for school but you can't buy class 
School of hard knocks I'm a grad

Dipping different rovers whipping with the soda 
Hovaaaaa!!! 
Could u even have any doubt after doubt if its over

[T.I.] 
yea 
ha! 
ya think? 
thats right 
You go see Weezy for the wordplay, 
Jeezy for the birdplay, 
Kanyeezy for diversity and me for controversy, 
All my verses picture perfect and they meant to serve a purpose, you ain't living what you kicking and you worthless, 
Looking from the surface it may seem that I got reason to be nervous then observe my work and see that my adversity was worth it, 
Verses autobiographical, absolutely classical, 
last thing I'm worried 'bout is what another rapper do, 
Ain't nobody hot as me even if they rap they ass off blast off and have outstanding qualities, 
Sell alotta records I respect and salute that, 
but spitting real life on hot beats I'm the truth at 
You kick it like me no exaggeration necessary, 
living revolutionary, nothing less than legendary, 
Gangsta shit hereditary, got it from my dad 
flow colder than February with extraordinary swag
