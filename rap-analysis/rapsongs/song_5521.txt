Yeah, we gotta hold down the fort
We gotta hold down the block
We gotta hold down the fort
We gotta hold down the fort, check it
Nineteen-ninety motherfuckin' three, right?
What's your new year's resolution motherfucker?
Check this out, we gotta hold down the block
Word is bond kid, uh, aight
Beef on the block, who is he?
Set it Dunn, me and my automatic likes to get busy
Ghetto representer, there ain't no motherfucker better
While you be catchin' feelings like a love letter
I gotta hold down my fort and won't lose
Nigga die because I got the tec 9 blues
Bulletproof polo, I'm goin' out solo
Whoever wanna come better step like they know
'Cuz I'ma survive, more rougher than a certified
Around the way, parlay and get high
My mega blast will last in days to pass
Niggaz shoot, too fast, to pull out your gun last
That's why I like to spark first and shoot your
Bitch ass down your next ride will be a fuckin' hearse
'Cause little niggaz don't die son
Half step and get that ass lit up like a flare gun
Cops they want static, whatever they can have it
My name is prodigy and I'm known to cause havoc
And when I flip I be on some ill shit
I walk the street, like a real super trooper
The block shit proper, who once got had
Mad beef with the dread who sold me that dirt bag
Mad props to the bad little niggaz in the neighborhood
Long live the short, gotta hold down the fort
Gotta hold down the fort
Gotta hold down the fort
We gotta hold down the fort
You gotta hold down the fort
We gotta hold down the fort
You gotta hold down the fort
So hold me down son, hold me down
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, how we go son, pull out the motherfuckin' M1
Straight from the 'bridge so you know where I'm from
The little, project nigga, I gets no bigga
Yo, my crew is buck so mother fuck how you figure
Step the fuck back, nigga, attack with the mack
'Cause word is bond it's on
Shit is real around the way so sit back and take notes
Dead you on your coat, then cut your motherfuckin' throat
Takin' life like a thief in the motherfuckin' night
While I write write, you bite bite bite
Niggaz wanna step to my business
But I just parlay and sip on my Guinness
'Cause I'm the ripper, Mr. Flip the scripture
Niggaz can't fuck with the flow of a real lil nigga
I wreck shop, in fact, get the mac, this is real
Shit is real, how the fuck you figure, nigga nil
So son hold me down while I pull out the glock
Gotta hold down the block, that's word to my pops
So once again it's on, light up the charm
Time to drop the bomb, word is bond
We gotta hold down the block
Hold down the block
We gotta hold down the block
We gotta hold down the block
Yo son he pumpin' over here Dunn?
I know he ain't pumpin' over here yo
Yo, word is bond yo son peep
He comin' over let's bring it to him
What, what? What what what, what?
Who the fuck are you?
Man fuck that, what?
Hold down the block
Yeah what up now?
What what, what what?
What up now?
Hold down the block
To all the niggaz that's live or real
You gotta hold down your block, cock back the glock
Fuck the cops, 'cause your neighborhood chores
If they beef, make 'em bleed on the project floors
I get my kicks from loadin' up gun clips
Don't fuck with suburb chicks, I need a gangsta bitch
Don't need a crew, I can bust you down solo fast
And after that, dip into the weed stash
I'm quick to blast, enemies won't last the fate
I kill 'em fast so they can't retaliate
'Cause when I'm not alive who'd takes my place
To hold down the fort, we move on
My man got my back
I'm ready to go at anybody, who think they John Gotti
Peace to Manny C, good lookin' out B
I'm hell bound, got my block locked down
We gotta pull out the glock
Gotta pull out the glock
We gotta pull out the glock
We gotta pull out the glock
We gotta pull out the glock
We gotta pull out the glock
We gotta pull out the glock
We gotta pull out the glock
We gotta pull out the glock
We gotta pull out the glock
We gotta pull out the glock
We gotta pull out the glock
We gotta pull out the glock
We gotta pull out the glock
We gotta pull out the glock
We gotta pull out the glock
Check it, yeah, call that nigga
