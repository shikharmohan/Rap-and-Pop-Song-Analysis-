It's like 4 and to the 5 and to the 6 and to the 7
I once was told that all Doggs go to Heaven
Well, how ya been? Where ya been and what it look like?
My game trump tight especially when it bump like
Four DPG's gettin' crazy
And No Limit is the label that pays me
Ridin' 'round town layin' game down like Goldie
And I remember what my momma showed me
Told me game recognize game
And stay true to what ya do and don't be ashamed
I got all my game from her sometimes I have to wonder
How I keep from goin' under, I'm a bad muthafucka
I fall to my knees, thank God before I do my thang
I don't know why, I love to gang bang
See life ain't nuthin' but a twist anyway, bitch, anyway
You can say what you wanna say
Just don't get in my way 'cause I'm a mean old
Fiend know, C know and P know, see loc'
We make music for the thugs and the bangers
And the bitches, fuck them R&B; singers
She want a nigga with his khackies hangin' real low
In a black rag Sixty-four
Hit it down the street, way clean
Bangin' that real shit nigga like Al Green
I'm headed straight to the LB
"Forget it", that's what they tell me
Sell me everythang except some bullshit
And when it's time for the gunfight nigga pull quick
'Cause ain't nothin' butter but us
And nigga you'll get wet up for fuckin' with my cheddar
It's cold outside, nigga grab ya sweater
And that bad bitch you fuckin' with
Nigga she get ya set up

Boy, you done, put all ya trust in that hoe
Didn't ya see what happened to the President Niggaro?
Livin' in a tight house, big as the White House
You fucked around and stuck ya dick
In that white bitch mouth
What you talkin' 'bout? Fool, I'm dirty like the South
And to be real, I feel that's how I'm comin' out
Back on the hoe stroll, highway pimp patrol
Put ya cuffs on ya, girl, nigga let her off parole
Man nigga way cold with his game
What's his muthafuckin' name? Who? Huh!
I'm the capital S,  don't fuck with stress
N double O P D O, muthafuckin' double G
Coldest entertainer, gangbanger since Alphonz Capone
Count money like Basie police try to chase me
Niggas try to replace me but you can't
I'm ridin' in a tank, I'm blowin' hella dank
So whether ridin' in ya lo-lo or blowin' on some doe doe
Spread the word and take the fo' door
The Last Don done hooked up with the muthafuckin'
King of the coast with the most here's a toast
With Snoop Dogg is the representer
Through the niggas and G's through the LBC's
Through the Calio projects, Brooklyn to Queens
Chi-town woe now, the Dogg Pound in the house
Every time we touch down right next to my hometown
D-town, Eastside St. Louie
Spokane, get ya money, man, tic-tock
Little Rock, right next to Houston, Texas
Home of Rap-A-Lot, we like to jack a lot
Gimme what ya got, let me get that up out ya, nigga
I got ya somethin' for the summertime while it's hot
And got the bitches posted up in the parkin' lot
And guess what, they want the
Nigga with the biggest nuts
A nigga who don't give a fuck
See, niggas like me, all we see is
Money, power moves, and a bitch a week
And last but not least my nigga BOZ
Much love from the N.O, my nigga, feel me, oh, yeah
And my little cousin DAZ, forever, nigga
This DPGC, oh, yeah, and Dr. DRE [Incomprehensible]
You know where I'm at? Holla at me
Get at me holla at me nigga holla at a Dogg that's real
Y'all niggas know what's happenin'
It's still a thang, it's still a G thang
