Have fun, y'all
Have fun, y'all
The city breathing all down your neck
Bad news and good dope, special effects
And reality's deep
Bright, black sinking in deep
Who ain't shy of the pain?
Who ain't shy of the pleasure? Just the same
Life is a game, I heard the homies say
Well, I came to win, so I'm not here to play
Have fun, get it
Have fun, get it, get it
Have fun, get it
Have fun, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Ecsatic, fantastic, get it
Wow, get it, wow, speedball
Bad news and good dope
Powder, potion, pills, smoke
Baby, how you trying to go?
Doody or Lucy? Fast or Slow? Yeah? No?
It's okay, you can have it your way now
It ain't all good but baby, I'm cool
Feeling great, feeling good, how are you?
10% condition, 90% response
Survival mathematics, the number man's song
Old dad dropped a jewel so pure
When the times get raw it's something I recall
Sometimes I don't remember it at all
It gets stormed by the weather with no umbrella
The sky release pressure and the ground get wetter
My outfit effed up, I coulda looked fresher
But guess what? To hell with parade day rain
Tsunami or sunshine, Obama just the same
Life is a game I heard the homies say
But I came to win
Dante, get it
Play, get it, get it, get it
Brooklyn, ecstatic, everyday
Don't stop, speedball
Bad news and good dope
Powder, potion, pills, smoke
Baby, how you trying to go?
Doody or Lucy? Fast or Slow? Yeah? No?
It's okay, you can have it your way now
Nasty times but baby, I'm cool
Feeling great, feeling good
Everyday, everyday
Having a good time everyday
Having a good time everyday
Having a good time everyday
That's cool
