[45 king]
Let's start the show off, sisters ago look alive
The queen latifah, the king of 45
Bringing a mixture of pure flavor
I make beats, she rock rhymes, so I gave a
A sample sound, the she added a compound
Word, this is for those who haven't heard
A king and queen combine minds and trample
Thos who oppose us, here's an example
[queen latifah]
It's time to run, the king and queen is on the set
The competition is petty and ready to step
To the first one, go ahead, rehearse one
I hope you don't know you sound like the worst one
Rhymes are smoking, concentration can't be broken
Queen latifah's outspoken
Use your imagination, picture this
Any male or female rapper trying to diss
Here for excitement and enticement
With my competitors killed I go build with my enlightenment
Teach the youth, feed the needy
Confident decendent of queen nefertiti
The mother of civilization will rise
Like the cream and still build the strong foundation
Secondary but necessary to reproduce
Acknowledge the fact that I'm black and I don't lack
Queen latifah is giving you a piece of my mind
A rhyme spoken by a feminine teacher
Rhymes I do employ, no time for slimy toys
I'm steady and stable and the label is tommy boy
Backed by the unit, produced by the king
Perfection pressed with the style that we bring
For the hip-hop patients, this is a king and queen creation
[45 king]
Technician, musical musician
I'm stating the facts, strictly non-fiction
In hip-hop, you wonder who's in trouble most
Creativity, you get a double dose
How can you stop me? no, I put you to a test
The rhymes are romeo (the beat's a juliet)
With topic blend, this makes me a hard one
Persevere, I'm here, gets taught one
Strength producer, I send you an ultimatum
Hardcore worldwide is how I take 'em
I rock, never hyperventilate
Others get tired, could use a commercial break
45 king, dj mark's my alias
It takes a ton of mc's to prevail against me
Just listen, I'm unstoppable
You want a mission? this one's impossible
Beats rock all night with no curfew
My talent's advanced, you haven't a clue
How I do it, the smoothest loopest spare it
If the style fits, I wear it
Many attempts were made, none was recognized
45 king said sample soundified
I'm going to wonderland to check, find out who's next
You pretty good, but not quite a legend yet
Studio mixer, I got the formula
And said the man from self, I'm warning you
It's my domain, just ask my chauffer
My ride's equipped everything from a pool to a sofa
On top, it's a usual act
Can't wait to get down to 45 studios
I'm into rap, but no urge to sing
I'm dj mark, 45, 45 king of swing
