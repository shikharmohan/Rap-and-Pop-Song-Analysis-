Say ice-cream
Say ice-cream
Say ice-cream
Watch these rap niggaz get all up in your guts
French-vanilla, butter-pecan, chocolate-deluxe
Even caramel sundaes is gettin' touched
And scooped in my ice-cream truck, Wu tears it up
Yo honey-dips, summertime, fine Jheri drippin'
See you on Pickens with a bunch of chickens how you're clickin'
I catch shootin' strong notes as we got close
She rocked rope, honey throat smellin like impulse
Your whole shell baby's wicked like Nimrod
Caught me like a fresh-water scrod, or may I not be God
Attitude is very rude Boo, crabby like seafood
It turns me on like Vassey and Lahrule
 
By any means, Shirley Temple cross was done by Billie Jean's
Black Misses America, your name is Erica, right true
Lazy eyeball, small piece, six shoe
Caramel complexion, breath smellin' like cinnamon
Excuse me hon, the Don mean no harm, turn around again
God damn, backyard's bangin like a Benz-y
If I was jiggy, you'd be spotted like Spudz McKenzie
I'm high powered put Adina Howard to sleep
Yo pardon, that bitch been on my mind all week, but uhh
Back to you Maybelline Queen let's make a team
You can have anything in this world except cream
So whatchu wanna do? Whatchu wanna do?
Let's go ahead and walk these dogs and represent Wu
Watch these rap niggaz get all up in your guts
French-vanilla, butter-pecan, chocolate-deluxe
Even caramel sundaes is gettin' touched
And scooped in my ice-cream truck, Wu tears it up
Shaolin's finest, whattup Boo, peace your highness
Yo I'm loungin', big dick style, y'all niggaz is the flyest
Moves you're making too fly jewels are shaking
Not a rape patient, you're looking good fly colored Asian
Ghettoes, them is your hometown, we can go the whole round
After that, I'm shootin' downtown
I'm rockin hats and you wig is all intact
Who's that queen bee chick, eyes curly black
Freaks be movin' in fly sneaks
Two finger rings and gold teeth, and ain't afraid to hold heat
So when I step in the square dear
You better have cream, to share, Ricans, Ven Aqui yeah
Watch these rap niggaz get all up in your guts
French-vanilla, butter-pecan, chocolate-deluxe
Even caramel sundaes is gettin' touched
And scooped in my ice-cream truck, Wu tears it up
Ice cold bitches melt down when my clutch
And what they titties sucked, ice cream
Say Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang
Watch these rap niggaz get all up in your guts
French-vanilla, butter-pecan, chocolate-deluxe
Even caramel sundaes is gettin' touched
And scooped in my ice-cream truck, Wu tears it up
Ice cold bitch melt down when in the clutch
They want they titties sucked, ice-cream
