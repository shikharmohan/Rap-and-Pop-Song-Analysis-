[intro]
the westcoast warlord.
tha grime wizard
ice cube
mothafucking head so big they
call him jack n tha box.
[verse 1]
ima superhero, like Lou Ferrigno 
maybach deniro, look like a zero
shine the spotlight, this is my night
get your cameras ready, let it rain confetti
im a champion, i do what cant be done
in the real league nerd not the fantasy one
throw your hands up, you can cheer for your boy
when i hit the stage get a ear full of noise
when i bring the noise from here to illinoise
muthafuckaz love when i do what it does
im allstar, superstar entertainer
world class, first ballad hall of famer.
some rappers claim that they got a heart full of anger
how when your lyrics were written by a stranger
fool im the greatest, you just the latest
im loved by ya grandmama, and ya babies
[chorus]
see my head is so big they call me jack n the box
you cant impress me, so fuck what you got
i say my head is so big they call me jack n the box
dont talk about money cause im stacking alot
shine that light on me, put that light on me
cause i was sent to the world, by G O D
shine that light on me, put that light on me
cause i was sent to the world, by G O D
[verse 2]
i was a born loser, i was a born sinner
now i am a winner, in the convention centre
i got to take a bow, cause i still wonder how
the system didnt get me when i was a juvenile (just think)
just think if i had got locked up
no boys n the hood thanks to america
no eazy N W A no fried day
dont let ya muthafucking talent go to waste
dont catch a case cause these people got a place
to throw your life away and take you right out the waist
throw your hands up, you got to man up
i had to show the world, what i was made of
what yu say blood, i was a slave cuz
now im VIP, up in vegas
im up in nike town, so how you like me now
see the whole industry had to bite my style
[chorus]
see my head is so big they call me jack n the box
i knew we would win, so im bragging alot
i say my head is so big they call me jack n the box
my shit is so dope, its like cracking a pop
shine that light on me, put that light on me
cause i was sent to the world, by G O D
shine that light on me, put that light on me
cause i was sent to the world, by G O D
[bridge]
now mama dont be mad, i got to show my ass
and thank these muthafuckaz for my past
i got to let them know i neva brake like glass (neva)
what you looking at is top notch world class  
now mama dont be mad, i got to show my ass
and thank these muthafuckaz for my past
i got to let them know i neva brake like glass (neva)
what you looking at is top notch world class
[final chorus]
see my head is so big they call me jack n the box
you cant impress me, so fuck what you got
i say my head is so big they call me jack n the box
dont talk about money cause im stacking alot
shine that light on me, put that light on me
cause i was sent to the world, by G O D
shine that light on me, put that light on me
cause i was sent to the world, by G O D
