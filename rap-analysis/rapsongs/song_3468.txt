Now turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up, now turn it up
Can't live my I, I can't live my
I can't live my, I, I can't live my
I can't live my, can't live my
I can't live my, I, I can't live my
Life this way, continually get high
Instead of runnin' round, lock one bird down
It's a new day, gotta do it big just to get by
Show no respect, can't live that way
Ya hold my check, can't live that way
With out my chick on deck, can't live that way
They say what they like but I been that way
My moves calculated through the lens almost here
Success will be the best revenge
Man from Clint East to Kanye West
The sun can't chill but every day it sets
This time I made up my mind
This time I'm back on my grind
I know there's things in my life
That I'm a let go startin' tonight
I can't live my I, I can't live my
I can't live my I, I can't live my
I can't live my I, I can't live my
I can't live my life this way
I can't live my I, I can't live my
I can't live my I, I can't live my
I can't live my I, I can't live my
I can't live my life this way
My favorite girl wanna leave me just because I got a girlfriend
My freak girl tell me now she a Christian
My white girl wanna move back to Michigan
I'm pullin' girls off the bench like a six man
I'm in the club doin' the same ol' two step
While Omega's doin' the same ol' Q step
I had my money on my mind I was thinkin' green
She a pledge A.K.A. she was pink and green
I want a good girl, she want a gentleman
We sayin' the same thing like a synonym
I weren't really spittin' game I was scrimmagin'
My pimpin' ship so hard it needs censorship
I'm in Chicago ends, till Chicago ends
Till we blow like Chicago wind
I don't know what's better, gettin' laid or gettin' paid
I just know when I'm gettin' one the others gettin' away
This way
This time I made up my mind
This time I'm back on my grind
I know there's things in my life
That I'm a let go startin' tonight
I can't live my I, I can't live my
I can't live my I, I can't live my
I can't live my I, I can't live my
I can't live my life this way
I can't live my I, I can't live my
I can't live my I, I can't live my
I can't live my I, I can't live my
I can't live my life this way
Go 'head, flip a coin so the game can start
Believe I know the drama, kid name the part
I learned before the hot flame came the spark
It's like before the pop fame came the pour
But this industry'll play with your life man
They're playin' with your rent, food, water and lights, man
That's why I rock the beat like that old tightie-T Jam
The batter ram, then I'm off to Amsterdam
To rest up for strength, to deal with this weight
To deal with these deals, to deal with this hate
I dedicate this to Jam Master J
Run DMC showed me how to walk this way!
This time I made up my mind
This time I'm back on my grind
I know there's things in my life
That I'm a let go startin' tonight
I can't live my I, I can't live my
I can't live my I, I can't live my
I can't live my I, I can't live my
I can't live my life this way
I can't live my I, I can't live my
I can't live my I, I can't live my
I can't live my I, I can't live my
I can't live my life this way
This way, this way, this way, hey
This way, this way, this way, this way, hey
