Gimmie this, gimmie that, gimmie this, gimmie that
Bitch, step back and don't try to jack
But Mister Dopeman, Dopeman, can I get a hit?
No hoe, but you can get my duck sick
But let me finish my story as I was sayin'
I told you lil' locs ain't playin'
Gotta roll with the bunches
Can't help the travellin' bunches
Now, ain't that somethin'?
Just a case a few niggaz try to trip
Bone-out, put on my skimask
And come back blastin'
'Cause niggaz my height don't fight
My name is Eazy E, you're mothafuckin' right
They must to thought I was a busta
You're wearin' your bullet proof vest, so what's next?
I got my nine fitted up with Teflon
And don't let me hit the wet bomb
So watcha wanna do?
The red, white and blue, I got something for you too
'Cause it gon' be on when I'm kickin' down my dough
So, say hello to my new 44
I'm a type of nigga that smokes mothafuckaz
I'm a type of nigga that smokes mothafuckaz
I don't give a fuck, fuck, smoke mothafuckaz
I'ma smoke mothafuckaz 'cause I'm the 'E'
So, you can kiss my black ass
Fuck the White House, it ain't my house
So, you can burn the mothafucka down for all I care
'Cause T-shirts and khakis is all I wear
I'm from the city where they show no pitty
For a punk ass mark in the park
Blow his brains out, stuck him in the bushes
Take his gat and leave his ass for the rats
And let me hit that Cisco, I got a 187 on my pistol
Warrant by the L A P D K for puttin' in work out my trade
Because the President never simp, one damn dog to my residents
I'm goin' crazy like 1980, I need my ends, fuck you, pay me
Or I'ma have to get the strap, my nutty O.G., buddy Big Black
I make you shit in your pants and shake like Jello
So, tell all my homie I said, "Hello"
I'm a type of nigga that smoke mothafuckaz
I'm a type of nigga that smoke mothafuckaz
I don't give a fuck, smoke mothafuckaz
Smoke mothafuckaz like it ain't no thang
You cant check a checker
But when you wanna try let me know
I got the strecher on stand-by
Starvin' for a nigga like you
The things is hard as much bigger than a trigger
So I can show how to put in work
The Ruthless network, drive by experts
Straight outta Compton, kickin' up dust
The place where guns don't get a change to rust
I warned them and they still approached me
Now, I got two more Golf hats for my trophy
I got a brand new trend, it's killin' men
Who is that? That's my little friend
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
Smoke mothafuckaz like it ain't no thang
