Gimme all the rhythm and blues niggas
Then rock the shots of the liquor
They make me cum quicker
Rub between your belly like jelly, R.Kelly
You think, you ballin' but your body's callin'
Free fallin', you roll in fuck the bumpin' and grindin'
Have you jumpin' and whinin' when I'm climbin
I be doin' groups like Troup body rockin'
H Town or Horace Brown, watch out now
Babyface can pay da rent and cook me five meals
My mama got the ripper pill
What the deal on that Prince cat
He be lookin' fruity but you still can eat the booty
Brian McKnights tight Joe is kinda slow
Oh what about D'Angelo
I want some of that brown sugar
Then watch this rap bitch bust all over ya nuts like
Dreams, dreams, dreams of fucking an R&B; dick
  (Dreams of fucking an R&B; dick)
Dreams, dreams, dreams of fucking an R&B; dick
  (Dreams of fucking an R&B; dick)
I fuck Mike Sta flyway, fuck dem LaDae cats, they wack
And one on of dem resemble Craig Mack
I need a new edition, I need some men with vision
Pussy eatin' position to go to shower pissin'
I made my intro getting fucked in the Pinto
Now I'm skin deep in da Lexus Jeep
Peep da Queen sista, if I would fuck wit Mista
They'd be suckin' blackberry molasses out my asses
Jason, who da fuck time ya wastin' [Incomprehensible]
I got no patience for little dick tastin'
I'd rather go dolo, solo then I can get some Heaven
And be the fuck out after seven
All for One and one for all
I swear to God I'd never fuck with none of ya'll
And if ya immature, than I'm out the door
I'm on fire gettin' head by the Harlem Boys Choir
Dreams, dreams, dreams of fucking an R&B; dick
  (Dreams of fucking an R&B; dick)
Dreams, dreams, dreams of fuckin' an R&B; dick
  (Dreams of fucking an R&B; dick)
I couldn't find a mall with Kenny Lattimore
Montell Jordan ain't scorin'
Tevin Campbell niggas like to shamble
Make an example with this pussy sample, her we go
You didn't know Joe was my hoe Tony Rich my bitch
Don't fuck with this
I got the 112 nuts to bust so just open wide
When I'm done give me a high five
You can touch me and tease me, as if my name was Case
But we got to drink a pace for me to participate
Don't playa hate nigga, it's cool with me
I'm icin' Bryson that dude down with Groove Theory
Dreams, dreams, dreams of fucking an R&B; dick
  (Dreams of fucking an R&B; dick)
Dreams, dreams, dreams of fucking an R&B; dick
  (Dreams of fucking an R&B; dick)
Dreams, dreams, dreams of fucking an R&B; dick
