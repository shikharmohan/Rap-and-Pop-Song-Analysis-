When you've had enough
when you've got it bad enough
and you can't let go
when it comes to blows
and you start to overflow
but you can't get home
it's a subtle kind of cruel
it taps my spine
here I'm drawing a line
I'm asking you please
don't you wanna be
happy with me?
don't you wanna be
happy with me?
I'm afraid if you don't come around soon
I'll turn sadder than you ever were
I know the loneliness is worse
you've gotta try...
December's all alone
and he's calling me on the phone
but he sounds so cold...
he says he loves me so
but how would I ever know?
certain words grow old
it's a vicious kind of catch
it sides me blind
now I'm out of my mind
I wanna scream
don't you wanna be
happy with me?
don't you wanna be
happy with me?
I'm afraid if you don't come around soon
I'll turn sadder than you ever were
the loneliness is worse
you've gotta try...
love liked me long ago
it had a way of making everyone the same
but how the angels
(how the angels)
must laugh inside
(singing with me now)
with me screaming with you
and needing you this way
(needing you this way)
oh, why don't you wanna be
happy with me?
don't you wanna be
happy with me?
I'm afraid if you don't come around soon
I'll turn sadder than you ever were
I know the loneliness is worse
you've gotta try...
to stay mine
all the way
don't you wanna be
happy with me?
don't you wanna be
happy with me?
I'm afraid if you don't come around soon
I'll turn sadder than you ever were
it's got a way of making everyone the same
it's got a way of making everyone the same
it's got a way of making everyone the same
it's got a way of making everyone the same
