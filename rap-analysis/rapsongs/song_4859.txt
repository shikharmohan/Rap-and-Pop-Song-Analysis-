Kel, Cris
And we just clubbin' on some smooth, shhh
Ludacris, can't hide or deny
That I wanna get you down to them Vickie Secrets
And your body, I won't misguide mistreat or mislead it
Hate it up, love it, they can't cut it, so strut it
Number one shaker, like Vicks Vapor, I wanna *** rub it
Louisville, slug it, hit 'em with a right left, it's gone
Tell every last one of ya girls how good it was and it's gone be on
Soul Train, wood *** from me
No pain, no gain, it's so plain to see
They be like, "I've been feelin' kinda stressed, can you blow my back out?"
And I'm like, "Yeah but don't trip if I happen to yank a track out"
When I get done, it's smooth sailin' once I pull that 'Lac out
Next destination, I move forward like Jerry Stackhouse
And 1, have fun, when you chillin' with Ludi
We'll slow grind and slow jams while I'm feelin' yo' booty
We'll hold hand and hold times when I'm up in that ***
You so fine, I'm so sad that you feelin' so woozy
Got you feelin' woozy, baby, baby
And that's hows it gon' be when I take you from the club
To the crib on dubs and I get you in the bed with me
You're so pretty and so sweaty and so sexy and so ready
Girl, I'm surprised you this nasty
But it's cool 'cause I always wanted to go *** on a girl
That reminds me of me
So get upstairs, get yo' clothes off, get them sexy legs legs in a 'V'
Your vision blurry as if you were seein' two of me
You're so fine, I'm so sad that you feelin' so woozy
Bein' with you make me feel like I just hit the lotto
Other girls, I give 'em a shoulder colder than Chicago
But in ya center, I heat it up in the Mourning like Alonzo
And I'd get it, I'd bit it, I'd split it, I'd hit it up in the Tahoe
Bravo, make, make, make it clap, I'd break, break, break ya back
Then tuck, tuck, tuck you in so you can take, take, take a nap
Then back to makin' dividends, I'm in the wind
Somewhere hot, I stay on islands longer than Gilligan
Sippin' on a Pina Colada, little mama, I'mma make ya holla
How does it sounds when you makin' love on top of a million dollars?
I can only imagine, let's make it real, baby
Like D'Angelo, 'How Does It Feel', baby
I know I talk a lot *** but I can back it up, up, up
Like B.B.D., flip it, rub it down, smack it up, up, up
You so bad when you call me for duty
You so fine, I'm so sad that you feelin' so woozy
Got you feelin' woozy, baby, baby
And that's hows it gon' be when I take you from the club
To the crib on dubs and I get you in the bed with me
You're so pretty and so sweaty and so sexy and so ready
Girl, I'm surprised you this nasty
But it's cool 'cause I always wanted to go *** on a girl
That reminds me of me
So get upstairs, get yo' clothes off, get them sexy legs legs in a 'V'
Your vision blurry as if you were seein' two of me
You're so fine, I'm so sad that you feelin' so woozy
Don't get caught up with the gossip, them chicks is jockin', girl
They just jealous, everybody hates when Cris is rockin' ya world
Hey girl, hey friend, how you doin', where you been?
Enough of that talkin', let's begin, break it in
Shake and spin, take it in, say amen
Then I'll make you say goodness gracious
Look me in the eye and make them nasty faces
I'm so glad that your body's so juicy
You so fine, I'm so sad that you feelin' so woozy
Got you feelin' woozy, baby, baby
And that's hows it gon' be when I take you from the club
To the crib on dubs and I get you in the bed with me
You're so pretty and so sweaty and so sexy and so ready
Girl, I'm surprised you this nasty
But it's cool 'cause I always wanted to go *** on a girl
That reminds me of me
So get upstairs, get yo' clothes off, get them sexy legs legs in a 'V'
Your vision blurry as if you were seein' two of me
You're so fine, I'm so sad that you feelin' so woozy
Girl, said your body is what I want
I'll be makin' ya scream and moan
Girl, let's get on up out this club
Get you to my home
