I'd like to welcome the Western Union
On to this 'Blue Carpet Treatment'
Some player partners of mine
We gonna show you this new dance we got
Like this, it's easy to do
Like this, yeah, it's so easy to do
Grab a honey, take her to the floor
And do it just like this
You can do it, you can do it, just just like this
You don't have to break it down to the floor
All you gotta do is keep movin' your hands
Like this, you can do it, you can do it too
Like this, you can do it, you can do it too
I feel player when I move and dance to the song
All I wanna do is get my groove on like this
I throw my hands like Marvin
Sorta like James Brown how I get down
I'm holdin' my chain so it don't swing
I'm slidin' my feet, stayin' on the beat
I dip low, then bring it back slow
If you didn't wanna dance why you on floor?
The mamis on the go with Mr. Luck on the catch up
Super duper behind and baby, this a set up
Two step with me, call your girls
I got 2 reps with me, they call the game quickly
Big boys move, I'm too cool for the runway
Player of the year, my gear is set for Sunday
Wait right here girl, I'm comin' back Monday
Slide right in front of me, get our dance on, Fred Astaire
Faye Dunaway, eyes on us while we move to the clap
I'm nice with the dance and I'm smooth with the rap
We in the zone with the lights and glamor
Glass full of Patron and cold as grammar
Coat made of panther, excuse me, miss
Let me show you how to do it
Like this, it's easy to do
Like this, yeah, it's so easy to do
Grab a honey, take her to the floor
And do it just like this
You can do it, you can do it, just just like this
You don't have to break it down to the floor
All you gotta do is keep movin' your hands
Like this, you can do it, you can do it too
Like this, you can do it, you can do it too
I feel player when I move and dance to the song
All I wanna do is get my groove on like this
Let me holla at you baby, come close
It's Big Snoop Dogg, king of the coast
Walk with me, stay focused
Put it on me little momma, let me see you stroke this
It seems like the more hits
On a slow drip, bubble like a four fifth
And everybody, everybody notice
So too cool-cool Calvin Broadus
And every woman is a goddess
And every rapper is a artist
Yeah right, you're dead wrong to sing along
It's Godzilla for realla, my n*** King Kong
Givin' n*** the blues
As I'm walkin' on these fools in my blue suede tennis shoes
I'm two steppin' with my *** close
On the dance floor, loc 'cuz you never know
Yeah, baby girl, she's s*** but she cool
'Cuz we ain't come to act no motherf*** fool
We just chillin' like a villain, got my hands to the ceilin'
And I'm feelin' the feelin', come feel it like
Like this, it's easy to do
Like this, yeah, it's so easy to do
Grab a honey, take her to the floor
And do it just like this
You can do it, you can do it, just just like this
You don't have to break it down to the floor
All you gotta do is keep movin' your hands
Like this, you can do it, you can do it too
Like this, you can do it, you can do it too
I feel player when I move and dance to the song
All I wanna do is get my groove on like this
Check it out, I, I know baby girl, I know
See out here on the West, naw, we don't do that
We don't do the motorcycle dance, we don't do the snap, uh uh
We do it a little somethin' like this
Come here, come here
You think you can do that with me, baby?
Do it just like this
Like this, like this
