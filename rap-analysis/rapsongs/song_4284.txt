Smokin all day drinkin on hard liquor(yea)
I stay high... even higher than a salt shaker
Im on silver haze what is u cheffin?
Im in the coupe keepin the rest of the birds sleepin
And Im high to the tip top...and im twisted with a slip knot
And Will i ever stop? Never that light it up bring it back
Bring a ounce not a sack
I got it foggy as a suana in the building
Looking for ur bong probably call it on the ceiling
Fallin on the railing catch me im gone
Im in another zone but trust me im home
Where the bloods be thicker than the army
And every time Copa roll up and say this one is the one
U know i gotta explode
I dont know where yall at but im in my mood where the...
