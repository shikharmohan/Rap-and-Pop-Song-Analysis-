You know a lot of these bitches need an antibiotic
Moxacillin, Penicillin, something with a slin' in it
They, they, want a sugar daddy, they want a man on a fixed income
They want man that they can come over to the old mans house
And go in the back porch and get 30 or $40 every here and there
And get in they Honda and ride on off
