Tried to gauge the porch with my broads on Watoo

Once upon a time there was this guy named Dane
Tried to fuck my bitch, but he kris krossed game
I don't owe this motherfucker in the first
But he done made livin' in my house
A whole lot worse
Tryin' to gain some stripes
It's nothin' nice, read him his rights
Collar him and laugh, rollin over and politickin' with the vice
Crackin' under pressure, bust a pipe
Snake eyes is crooked dice
(Goin' all up, out your way just to get them brownie points)
It's steaks and knives, read him his rights
So called best friend'll stab yo' ass in the back with a knife
And try to put yo' ass on ice
For brownie points and stripes
For brownie points and stripes
Niggaz'll take your life
Just to get them brownie points
You niggaz got me stuck, what?
Watchin' y'all spit it and get it fucked up
Lucked up, my mobb, niggaz, yeah, we gon' bust what
If he isn't never see mail, 'cause that we sell
Dope by the truckloads, hoes can catch it retail
Motherfuckers grindin' but we all ain't played
And all ain't paid, now watch 'em all get sprayed
Laid back and watch him misprint it, we been spit it
For you newcomers who thinkin' you done it, I put my fist in it
Let yo' bitch get it, serve a D and watch a bitch split it
If I ain't wit' it, it wasn't enough fuckin' chips in it
Niggaz try to gain stripe, I flame mic
Got 'em all caught up in the same shit, call it game tight
Keep my name hyped, strivin' to get my name right
When it's fucked up, I'm the one you can blame right
Hatin' on my niggaz when I did the shit
Yo, we the shit, represent this Hogg ass bitch
It's nothin' nice, read him his rights
Collar him and laugh, rollin' over and politickin' with the vice
Crackin' under pressure, bust a pipe
Snake eyes is crooked dice
(Goin' all up, out your way just to get them brownie points)
It's steaks and knives, read him his rights
So called best friend'll stab yo' ass in the back with a knife
And try to put yo' ass on ice
For brownie points and stripes
For brownie points and stripes
Niggaz'll take your life
Just to get them brownie points
