And she be dealing with some issues that you cant believe single black female addicted to retail.and well

man i promise im so self conscious thats why you always see me with at least one of my watches rollies and poshers done drove me crazy i cant even pronounce nothing pass that ver-say-see. Then i spent 400 bucks on this just to be like nigga you aint up on this. And i cant even go to the grocery store without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team it seems we living the american dream. But people highest up got the lowest self esteem. The prettiest people do the ugliest things for the road to riches and diamond rings. We shine because they hate us,floss cause they degrade us,we trying to buy back our 40 acres. And for that paper look how low we'll stoop even if you in a benz you still a nigga in a coupe.

Kanye West:
i say fuck the police thats how i treat em. We buy our way out of jail but we cant buy freedom. We'll buy alot of clothes when we dont really need em things we buy to cover up whats inside. Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth thats why shortys hollering "where the ballas at". Drug dealer buy jordans crackhead buy crack and a white man get paid off of all of that. But i aint even gonna act holyer than thou just fuck it, i went to jacob with 25 thou before i had a house and i'd do it again cause i wanna be on 106th and park pushing a benz. I wanna act ballerific like its all terrific i got a couple past due bills wont get specific. Got a problem with spendin before i get it. We all self conscious im just the first to admit it.
