Big shout out to Philly in the house
G. Simone, you know you're not alone
KRS-One on the microphone

Mad Lion hold tight
Brown skin woman, you a queen, not a, hoe
Any man that drop the lyric, what we give them the, bo
Brown skin woman you a queen and not a, hoe
Any man that drop the lyric, what we give them the, bo
We don't come with disrespect, we come with intellect
If you come with disrespect, you get a rope around your neck
Some people don't expect me, to be so violent
But me nah violent, just myself I protect
Too many time I see, young gwal pickadee
Pay five, ten, twenty, thirty dollar to see
Some rapper, some singer, some celebrity
Talk 'bout they wan fi sex up and fill up you body
But them nah talk about peelin' off some money
For the pumpin' on a bed, when you haf the baby
Whattaya think can happen next? After you're done havin' sex?
Too much of ignorance, not enough intelligence
Mahn me not against sex but too many DJ
Talk sex but them not talk about the next day
'Cause the next day them gone and you sit alone
Got 'em soup up your mic, pon de microphone
Brown skin woman, you a queen, not a, hoe
Any man that drop the lyric, what we give them the, bo
Brown skin woman you a queen and not a, hoe
Any man that drop the lyric, what we give them the, bo
Brown skin gwal them can't diss, yo
'Cause you run the show
Them call you all type of bimbo
But you know you're not a hoe
Bwoy pickade, check out your history
Brown man is a God in any city
White, man knew dat and dat was a shock
So dem whip up your bod' and dem whippin' not stop
But dem nah can't stop us wit de whip and de chain
So dem take away your history, erase your name
Still, with no name, with no fight, with no fuss
We just, take on the name, that Massa give us
That name is Nigga, the correct is Negro
It's Spanish for Black, white mahn call us dat
There is also Negroid, also Negro
Now, all nigga pon the corner playin' cee-lo
Man you're not a negro, 'cause you're skin is not black
Take a look at yourself, you're brown and that's a fact
You not jump from no tree, you not live in no cave
That's some garbage dem print, dem want you to behave
You a African man, some say Asian
You must respect your love, all brown skin woman
If you diss your woman, you not come wit no plan
So shut up your mowf, til you must understand
Brown skin woman, you a queen, not a, hoe
Any man that drop the lyric, what we give them the, bo
Brown skin woman you a queen and not a, hoe
Any man that drop the lyric, what we give them the, bo
I know you want me to call you a nigga, no
I know you want me to call you a hoe, no
I know you want me to call you a bitch, no
This is how it go
Yes Kris, you're large
