Let me holler at you
Yeah, can I talk to you?
Can I talk to you? Yeah
For a minute, yeah, can I talk to you?
Can I talk to you? Yeah, can I talk to you? Yeah
I want you, 'cuz you make my heart skip the beat that I drum to
I want to be the one you run to, when pain confronts you
You're everything, sometimes I get nervous when I'm in front you
You can hear it in my voice when I ask you if you comfortable
Look how love do, I'd practice the art of war for you like Sun Tzu
Come through and arouse you every morning like the sun do
If you blackout and collapse I want to help you to come to
Notice I haven't yet gotten to what I want from you
I want you to come to when I come through and make you shine
Like the sun do, I want you to be the valley for my river to run through
You're everything, send your soul through your lips to my heart
Sweet music will start I want you to be the music of my art
When people try to rip us apart we got to work to stay together
Go through the seasons of love and never change with the weather
This is my wish list, what I want not what I need there's a difference
These days I'm learning that words got power so I'm a be specific
Can I have a talk with you?
Can I make a dream come true?
Can I be in love with you?
'Cuz I would if I could
Yeah sunflower
You must live in the infinite blackness
That exists when I close my eyes
I see you when I fall asleep, I see you when I dream
Lil' darlin', set your soul on fire, be your one desire, lil' darlin'
Can I talk to you? Yeah, ooh, lil' darlin', lil' darlin'
Can I talk? Can I talk, can I talk, can I? Lil' darlin'
Can I talk, can I talk, can I talk to you? Set your soul on fire
