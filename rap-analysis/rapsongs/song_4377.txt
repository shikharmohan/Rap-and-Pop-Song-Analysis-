[Lil Wayne:]
Weezy F bitch, I'm tired of ya'll hatin'/
I know ya head hurtin', you Tylenol taking/
Motherfuckers I'm a man, just ask ya ol' lady/ 
Like a true gentleman, I'm after yo lady/
I'm a massacre waitin' to happen fuck all this rappin' boy/
I'll get the cap'n and leave u with holes like a napkin mane/
He gon need a napkin, no a band-aid, no a damn grave/
I am Rampage Jackson on a rampage step in my cage/
Picture on my page, print it in a best book/
Come up out my left pocket with a left hook/
Mama said knock ya out, money made me block ya out/
I got the game on lock, and I locked ya out/
My jewelry singin' like a opera house/
I bought that drop top 'Phantom of the Opera' out/
Get silly that's stupid man/
Never save a hoe she better ask Soulja Boy to superman/
YOU can bet when I say Polo down from head to feet/
Polo horses on my sheets, I get that from Pimp C/
Tall cup of DJ Screw, sittin' on a pint of Big Moe/
Sharper than a tac hoe, you can keep the tic toe/
Yea, red scarf on my neck/
Red diamonds lookin' like red barf on my neck/
Ugh
Tell my 'B's, nigga 'SU WOOP'/ 
Cause I be with more 'B'(eans)s than JuJu/
Big bro, I'm a big dog/ 
And I don't mean fleas when I say I'm ticked off/
Nigga I don't never scratch/
And if she throw that pussy, big dog fetch/
Paper soldiers on some sketch that shit/
I'm a draw that pistol and make yo chest a tablet/
You are just a tad bit and I'm a whole lot/
Young Money motherfucker but the money so not/
[Gudda Gudda:]
Sick with it hard body like Iron Mike/
My flow is C4 I drop bombs like dynamite/
Ya'll niggas is sweet, yeah sweet like Mike 'N' Ikes/
Bob Barker with the 'Vanna White' cause my 'Price is Right'/
Hit the club nigga, then I leave with two dikes tonight/
Let my niggas cut 'em up, then gon' get a slice tonight/
Niggas peep my wrist game, they can see my ice is right/
Blind everybody in this motherfucking spot tonight/
Superman, blowing on a Swisher full of krptonite/
Got the wolves with me, hear 'em holla in this bitch tonight/
Niggas say they hard body but I can't tell/
Nigga you can get your shit cracked like a crab shell/
You want war with the boy so be it/
We in all red like the fuckin' Soviet/
Army
Rush a bitch nigga if he talkin' crazy/
Hit 'em in his left like have him walking crazy/
