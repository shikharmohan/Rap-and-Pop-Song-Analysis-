Yeah, come on, come on, come on
This is my family, this is my family, my family

(Sing along, sing along)
Mo Thug, Mo Thug, Mo Thug, Mo Thug, Mo Thug
(Sing, sing, sing, sing along, sing along)
Mo Thug, Mo Thug, Mo Thug, Mo Thug
My family, oh, it means so much to me
Everywhere we go, playa haters gonna hate and that's for sure
My family tree recruited on this thugsta groove
Whatcha gonna do when they come for you?
I love my family, this Mo Thug family
You mean the world to me, heaven's where we gonna be
Together, together we stand
Together we fall, y'all, I never turn my back on y'all
(Mo Thug)
I got my halo cocked, goin' out with y'all, y'all
Come and look at this world that's ever so cruel
But the good Lord blessed us
Gave me true family I can depend on
500 Benz with the Synchro rims on
Now I can get off when the wind blow
But I'd like to thank You, Jesus Christ
For givin' for givin' up Your life for us
Now, I can think twice, 'fore roll the dice
Advice from a thug, tell mommy
I love her everyday, think of her
Take a look at your thugs to the front of the line
Hear the thunder grind off in my mind
We done partied overtime.
Destruction, terror, oh what an era
Let's get it together 'fore it's over
Be a soldier like my Mo Thug family
They never ever turned their backs on me
(Backs on me)
When I was down, my Mo Thugs is always around
And if there comes a time to pick or choose
(Pick or choose)
My Mo Thugs won't never lose
(Don't ya know your gonna lose)
We are the thugs, yeah, we be those children
(Gotta be that child)
We gotta keep on thuggin', that's how we make our livin'
(Gotta make my money, man, it's still the same, yeah)
You know who I be, once again, comin' at you
It's Jhaz
(Jhaz)
Megablast, top class, black Jag, cream rag
Playa, better check your hand, look out for the New Breed
Females comin' for ya, Mo Thug family roots runs too deep
'Brina trippin' on these haters surroundin' us trues on a daily basis
Smiling faces, jealous of this Mo Thug flippin' on the risin' status
Yeah, yeah, my family, yeah, my family, Mo Thug
(It's my family Mo Thug)
Tell me who the coldest, the playa you know?
  (The coldest)
I know for sure, sure, rollin' with Mo, rollin' with Mo
(Rollin')
You'll fall, gotta go, 'cause we survivin' these remainin' years
When the smoke clears, no fear, no tears, no tears
(No, no fear)
When there's a problem I can't solve
My family gets involved
We've been here through thick and thin
On my thugs I can depend
Been down from the getty go, since any a you
Can you feel me though?
Mo Thug takin' over from the north to west
Wanna test? Better come prepared
With your Smith and Wesson, now learn the lesson
Stop stressin', be true to the game
Mo Thug runnin' everythang
Everythang, everythang
We are soldiers, now, we want to thank you
For the time you've took to listen to our funky groove
I guess if it was not for them blessings
Weak evil thought would control my whole existence
We preach and speak true belief from
But then this family tree would fall
Crumble like Sodom, Gomorrah
Can't duck, can't run from the cut
Back up the wasteland field, peel for mine
The deal, how the click be real with it
My family tree standin' strong
Natural born in the world of madness
No gladness, leave a nigga insane
Gotta change my way 'fore the darkest day
Clickin' tight till the end with the gang
Come on, come on and swing this way
(Swing this way)
It got to be harmony, evil'll be done, wicked erased, erased.
Humbly united gatherin' souls understood
Mo Thug, Mo Thug, love 'em like one of my own
Hold on, I bet ya we'll never go wrong
If we stay strong against the evil that be tryin' to split ya
He, who gets conflict, must just be weak
It's gettin' clearer and clearer
(And clearer)
Enemies want to break my family down, pinnin' it
If we ever needed the Lord, we need Him now
Amen, amen, bless the Mo Thug children
And could You watch over mine for me?
Get up, get pumped, do what
Ya want just don't insult my game
Nigga, this is a family thang
Till I take one to the brain, I'll remain the same
You look out for me, I look out for you
This is what you do to unite your trues
It's all about Mo Thug, Mo Thug
Mo Thug, Mo Thug, Mo Thug
Mo Thug, Mo Thug, Mo Thug
Mo Thug, Mo Thug, Mo Thug, Mo Thug
