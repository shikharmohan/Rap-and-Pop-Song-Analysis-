Well, it's the super duper Snoopa, once again I'm on the fly
Swoopin' through I'm in my coupe and all the **** want a ride
If it's trippin' like I'm clippin' I'm still grippin' on my nine
We be crippin' while I'm dippin' with my C's up in the sky
And the East is still my side, I'm a reaper when I ride
**** a feature, I don't need a mother****, I'm the guy
I delete 'em, stampede 'em, straight eat 'em like some fries
Get a ketchup, get 'em messed up, turn the heat up let 'em fry
Ain't no different when I'm rippin', pimpin's still up in his prime
TV shows, movie ****, pimpin's still up on his grind
Man these **** don't know, I'm workin' with a nine
I ain't talkin' 'bout a gun, I'm talkin' feel it in your spine
When I hit it from behind, if I go up in your mouth
I might hit you in the mind, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout
It'll thrill ya, I'm the stealer that'll kill ya with the rhythm of a trigger
Mother**** better duck before I hit her, bang
Doggy Dogg is all you need
So love the Dogg, like we love weed
Breathe in, let it out
Breathe in, let it out
Breathe in, let it out
Breathe in, let it out
You **** mad 'cause I done came
And crept up back up on the scene
This is bye, retire, I'm still spittin' gasoline
I'm a gangsta mother**** what the **** you think that means?
Look **** I'm the king, I ain't givin' up a thing
If you want it come and take it ****, I'll be sittin' waitin'
Make a patient **** got the other ear and I'll bake a ****
**** it put the gun down and straight bank a ****
Take it ****, take it ****, ****, you ain't this ****
Slow down my turbo flow
Inhale my doe-doe smoke
Okay I let the fo'-fo' blow
And the po-po know, that's why they on my ****
And they at my crib, tryin' to find my ****
Tryin' to search my house, what the **** that's 'bout?
I ain't givin' up ****, you can search that ****
I ain't got nuttin' Jack get the **** on back
Doggy Dogg is all you need
So love the Dogg, like we love weed
Breathe in, let it out
Breathe in, let it out
Breathe in, let it out
Breathe in, let it out
Doggy Dogg is all you need
So love the Dogg, like we love weed
Breathe in, let it out
Breathe in, let it out
Breathe in, let it out
Breathe in, let it out
