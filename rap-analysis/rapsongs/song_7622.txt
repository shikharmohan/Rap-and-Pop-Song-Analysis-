[Chorus - Young Jeezy]
You scared,
Scared money don't make no money
You scared,
Scared money don't make no money
You scared,
Scared money don't make no money
don't make no money, don't hate no money,

[Verse 1 - Young Jeezy]
I aint never been scared,
you heard what I said,
if anything look, I'm over prepared,
they on that bullsh-t they don't want no bread,
it's like tellin' a bad b-tch I don't want no head,
not me I tell that b-tch to go ahead,
and when she done what she doing, I tell that b-tch to get bread,
done doing that I tell the b-tch to get dough,
done doing that I tell the b-tch to get mo'
welcome to the mind of a hustler a straight skitzo,
I am never scared of the money I got my pistol,
I am never scared when the block hotta than crisco,
your hood, yay area b-tch just call it Frisco
so listen up, tell me, stop talking sh-t though,
Silverado sittin on thirties i call it tip toe,
they say you no body till your ass in the feds,
can say the f-ck you want, you can't say that I was scared,
[Chorus - Young Jeezy]
You scared,
Scared money don't make no money
You scared,
Scared money don't make no money
You scared,
Scared money don't make no money
don't make no money, don't hate no money,

[Lil Wayne]
Young Mula in this mo-f-cka,
I ain't never scared of the money call me bone crusha,
stick my feet in the dirt like a long jumper,
and I wish a muthaf-cka wood, I chop lumber,
I'm a hustle junkie, I'm a grind slave,
more money than mistakes is what I've made,
money on my mind, I got my mind made,
if money grow on trees, I'm tryna find shade,
Sh-t, you n-ggas running from the money,
and I treat it like pussy, see I got the money cumming,
scary ass n-ggas, I bury cash n-gga,
cream in my pocket, strawberry flag n-gga
get the money first thats to every last n-gga
if u scared stay broke, gon get a cast n-gga
scary money don't make no money, old pussy ass n-gga
I take your money
UhhhhhÃ¢Â¦
[Chorus - Young Jeezy]
You scared,
Scared money don't make no money
You scared,
Scared money don't make no money
You scared,
Scared money don't make no money
don't make no money, don't hate no money,
