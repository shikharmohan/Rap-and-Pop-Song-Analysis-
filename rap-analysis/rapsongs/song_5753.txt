People climbed into the night like space suits
People stepped into the night like moon boots
Marching like moon troops
In their zoot colored zoot suits
People climbed into the night like cool wells
Shiny bottles in their hands
Drinking their new selves
They say it's their true selves
People climbed up in the night like green trees
They were hanging from the night like green leaves
Buzzing like queen bees
People climbed into the night like space suits
People stomped inside the night
Stomping and stomping and stomping
And stomping and stomping
Where are they going? What's the rush?
Everybody's embraced but so out of touch, hey
Nighttime is when the things get heavy
You feel alone and you want somebody
Loneliness whispers desperate measures
And you're frantic all by yourself
Nighttime is when the things get heavy
You feel alone and you want somebody
Loneliness whispers desperate measures
Baby, don't make no fast moves
Baby, don't make no fast moves
Baby, don't make no fast moves
Baby, don't make no fast moves tonight
La da da
People stomped inside the night
Let me climb into the night, let me climb
