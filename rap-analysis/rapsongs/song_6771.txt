It's time to slow it down
Steadily grinding
And this is the big Doggy Dog Dog
And I ain't talkin' about no Air Force Ones
I just gotta know
Before you let me get some
Do you have a fresh pair of panties on?
I've got to know
Or you could show me
Silk, cotton, see through lace, your sexy thong
I've got to know
Or you could show me
Freak a leek, peep, peep
Let a nigga sneak a few peek-a-boo
Let's see what we can do
About freakin' you
An' sneaking you into a quiet place
So I can look at it
Face to face
Let me guess
You prefer to wear cotton
I can tell
'Cause you like squattin'
Your last dude
He was so rotten
And now your love is to be gotten
Yeah, baby girl, I can read your mind
But what I'm really tryin' to do
Is read between your panty lines
I know it seems, oh, so personal
 
But I'm just trying to
Make you feel real comfortable
I know
So, what will it be?
And the type of underwear you wear
I mean, is troubling me
Can I get a glimpse?
One for the pimps
I've got one quesion
Answer me this
Do you have a fresh pair of panties on?
I've got to know
Or you could show me
Silk, cotton, see through lace, your sexy thong
I've got to know
Or you could show me
You came by the church
With a whole lot of body
Got invited to our annual pajama party
Workin' that lace
I think it was the first cut
Yeah bitch, you got a big ol' butt
Hiding it, should be dividing it
It's real tight in there
But I got a way to widen it
Sliding it real smooth
Like what a little bit of mouth aid
Is to getcha in the mood like
Zoom, boom hit that boom, boom
Right just to getcha groove right
I can make it happen
But it can't happen if you ain't good at it
When you gone, let a nigger have a look at it
Callin' all callers
Yeah baby girl, you a star
But it's on you if you wanna go real far
Now let me get a glimpse
One for the pimps
Now I've got one question
Answer me this
Do you have a fresh pair of panties on?
I've got to know
Or you could show me
Silk, cotton, see through lace, your sexy thong
I've got to know
Or you could show me
