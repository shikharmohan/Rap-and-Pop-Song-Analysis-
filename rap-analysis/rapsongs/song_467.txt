Why do I stay high?

If I could teach the world
(Whole wide world)
To be a thug in harmony
(Harmony)
Then I would teach the world
(Whole wide world)
To be a thugsta just like me
If I could teach the world
(Whole wide world)
To be a thug in harmony
(Harmony)
Then I would teach the world
(Whole wide world)
To be a thugsta just like me
How many mo dayz on this old earth can you see
It'z a crime to me, so we should get ready for Armageddons
'Cause I know God should be ready to roll
To go through all of tha wicked shit like Mr. Policeman
And duck if ya wanna pump your fist in tha air
And pray for tha politicianz freely, get a amen?
Tha last dayz of tha last dayz
Thas why I get high, thas why I get high
I'm holdin' onto my soul but nobody knowz when it all unfoldz
Then when I don't go, remember tha dayz 'cause I all I got
I go on my own with Bone, Bone, Bone muggin' runnin' through ya door
Hoez speakin' of tha last day iz on with tha plastic trial
What do you know? But I can't go wrong when I kick it with my song
I turn it up 'cause you luf that thuggish, ruggish Bone, Bone, Bone
Crossroadz that rulez tha world, enuf to make it
Where we almost lost those who meant so much
Why wasn't I chose?
But it will not stop Bone those shotz
Don't drop Bone no, no
If I could teach tha world to be a thug like me
Everybody thuggin' in heaven eternally
Everyday tha world goes round and round
I see it'z a small world after all, 'cause I can go meet 'an agree
With my fanz, smoke a lil' weed and have a lil' laugh at cha'll
But every now and then I getz caught up in a playa nation
Lord whas wrong with tha nation, erase them
But if I could teach tha world to be a thug just like me
You could live your lifestyle worry free, in tha armz of tha Lord eternally
No mystery but check tha essence of tha story, tha warrior
Wasteland warrior, so true, divine, it'z mine, East 1999
It'z where ya findin' all of my kind, every time
If I could teach the world
(Whole wide world)
To be a thug in harmony
(Harmony)
Then I would teach the world
(Whole wide world)
To be a thugsta just like me
(If I, if I)
We steadily united, not fairly divided, my thugstaz tha tightest
As good as I got it, they don't need to find us, us killaz and fightaz
'Cause tha critics and writerz mixed up when they typed our story
Tha wannabe warrior, thas for sure, and as thugz we're more and more
I got, we got too much shit to give, got shit to give
Expensive but still and still it'z all for tha lil' kidz, c'mon, oh, follow me
(Bone)
Way to go, we know tha way to go, follow me, follow me Bone
And thas why I stay high 'cause I got shit to deal with
Tha government and these playa hataz out to kill Wish
Wanna hurt this but uh-uh
I got two mo-thug niggaz you just cant fuck with
Artillery you can come with, nigga better let it rest shit
(Shit)
To tha lil' boyz and girlz all over tha world, tha shit that we say
Is from tha streetz, not for you to go and do, uh or to repeat
Please if we can, no more murder
How must I say this, if we can, no more murder
If I could teach the world
(Whole wide world)
To be a thug in harmony
(Harmony)
Then I would teach the world
(Whole wide world)
To be a thugsta just like me
