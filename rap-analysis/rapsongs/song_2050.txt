Yo, yo, whassup man? Yo, man gimme some of that old
Gangsta shit, y'knahmsayin'?
Some shit I can just kick back
Smoke a fat-ass joint to, y'knahmsayin'?
Hell, yeah, know what I'm talkin' about?
I like that old gangsta shit
'Cause you know it's a lot of niggaz out there
Woofin' all that bullshit
Talkin' 'bout they got this and got that
Talkin' louder than a motherfucker
But ain't sayin' shit
Y'knowhatI'msayin'?
Yeah, nigga, I see your lips quiverin'
But you ain't sayin' a motherfuckin' thang
But my niggaz, I got my niggaz in the motherfuckin' he-ouse
And they gon' tell you what's really goin' on
Got my motherfuckin' nigga RBX
Definitely in this motherfucker
I got my nigga Daz in this motherfucker
Ready to kick some real shit, knahmsayin'?
And that lil' shit you hear in the background
That's my homegirl Rage
So RBX kick this shit
Seven execution style murders
I have no remorse 'cause I'm the fuckin' murderer
Haven't you ever heard of a killer?
I drop bombs like Hiroshima
So now I walk around strapped
One-time bust they caps and watch niggaz collapse
Snap, adapt to this but you need no adapter
This is just the first chapter
In a book from a crook
You get caught slippin', yo' ass gots ta die
Nigga, tell me what the fuck you figure?
Trigger, happy RBX to cap ya
Pump, pump and I can't wait to bust a round
Pump, pump my hollow point smacks the clown
'Cause what I said split his head
And now they got me runnin' from the Feds
But I refuse to go alive
It's kill or be killed
That's how real niggaz survive
I'm high powered
Yeah
It's Daz that mass-murderin' motherfucker
So what you feel like, you wanna get caught up?
Fool you better recognize
Death Row came to chastise
So if you cross the Row
Remember the first name is Death
No love for the other side
