Cats don't know nothin', but show frontin'

Tryna holla at Shorty, you still tryna' talk, man

Yo, Grease I need this beat, no disrespect
I just got some shit I need to get off my chest
Look around and I see the rap game is a mess
So many chromes, now they gettin' me vexed
Upset and insane in how the game gonna change shit
Soundin' the same, and it's a ma fuckin' shame
While lames think they flow so sick, gettin' excited
Yeah they got a sick flow, its called the "Young Hoe Virus"
But, let me fall back into character
B got so hot, never been an amateur
Ask the locals, boy its Lo Co
Never Stop my flow, wanna go pro, you know
Check the history, started with the R's
Now I'm runnin' with the line, four time, no mystery
Dog, tryna position me to get in the door
But since the door don't open wide enough, we rippin' it off
Bloodline, we bout to blow, what!

Step up, nigga, sit down, put your shit down
Clowns ain't even built for the circus
I'm about to pop this nigga, dog, it ain't worth it
Tahhh, yea you right, soon as your man make
It dead at night I'll be there, alight? Then what?
Everything stops, money turns on the light
And pa pop pop pop!
None stop shots ringin' out, cowards hit the ground
I came to get down if you came to get down
Blow the pound up, niggaz wanna what with us
Bloodline and the dog I trust, so for the dog I bust
That thang, catch me while I'm up in the truck with that thang
Dog get the word, it's a must that I bang
And trust me, I'm gonna do my motherfuckin' thang
