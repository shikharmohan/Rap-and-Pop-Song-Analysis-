What type of games is being played, how's it goin' down?
If it's on till it's gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit me or what, they gon' try to give me a nut
Just honeys wanna give me the butt, wha
I'm politicking with this chick and wonderin' if I'm a creep her
Little hood rat bitch from twenty fifth named Tenika
Coming through, like I do, you know getting my bark on
Knew she was a thug because when I met her she had a scarf on
Fifty four eleven, size seven in girls
Baby face, would look like she was eleven with curls
Girlfriend, remember me, from way back, I'm the same cat
With the wave cap the motherfucker that TNT used to blaze at
Still here so it's all good
Oh you know my niggas rich and them doin' they thing on thirty fifth ave
It's a small hood, and it's all wood, so let me get that number
I get up, aight hit you on da track later on, say wassup
Talking to shorty made me wanna do something nice
Looking at that ass made me wanna do something tonight
And I know right when I see right, shorty lookin' like she tight
She bite, better give a nigga the green light, we might

I'm getting at shorty like what you need, what you want
Offer nothing, 'cuz I got you, must you front?
I see you with your baby father but it don't matter
You gave me the pussy, that ass is getting fatter
Let that nigga play daddy, make moves with me
I'd a kept it more than real boo, can't lose with me
Heard he smacked you 'cuz you said my name while y'all was sexin'
Ran up on this cat he thought was me and started flexin'
You know I ain't even with that
So he gon' have to get that just on TV
Try to creep me, leave that nigga sleepy
On the strength of you, that's your kid's daddy
I ain't gon' send him on his way, put him up in that big caddy
But let him know never mind yo, I need you to go
Take this snow up to one five oh, see Joe
Get that, come back with that we can split that, sit back
Fuck, puff A L, forget that you wit dat?

Aiyyo this chicken got me diggin' her moves, 'cuz she smooth
Wanna lose, whoever she choose, it's the dues
Respect is not expected but it's given 'cuz it's real
Being neglected and all, expect it, the deal
Lie, cheat, and steal for me
Putting something in a nigga's wig if you squeal for me
Kill for me, you still with me
'Cuz we get down like what
Told you from the start, it ain't all about a nutt
I'm gon' be fair, try to be there
We gon' see then, hit me with the question boo
That answer gon' be yeah
See there, something can go wrong, it does
Loved it, let it go but it came back, that's how strong it was
But you belonged to 'cuz, couldn't belong to me
You had two kids by this nigga, it was wrong for me
But we gon' always be, best of friends, mad love boo to the end
