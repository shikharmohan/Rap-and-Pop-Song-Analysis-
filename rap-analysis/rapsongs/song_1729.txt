All that's cool but, yo, what's up with me and you?
[Chorus x2]
See the blind mice? We the blind mice
Trying to get in where we fit in
Doing anything to be down
Two hundred million blind mice
Running through this town
[Shock-G]
Patty cake, patty cake I heard your man
Wears a gold Rolex and put a diamond on your hand
[Money B]
The itsy-bitsy spider was a whoridah
Said he met the judge's daughter and went up inside her
[Shock-G]
House, there's a mouse who runs round the clock snitching
Who he hitting, I think he hit it raw cause he be itching
[Money B]
Shimmy, shimmy cocoa pop, the glock went pop
Tell me, tell me who shooting and who got shot
[Malia]
Ring around the rosie, a pocket full of blow
Everybody know the hop got you moving slow
[Humpty-Hump]
Pinocchio says ignore my nose, you can trust him
I saw Bill in the back of Capitol Hill with Little Miss Muffin
[Shock-G]
Little boys in blue and red riding in the hood
Heard the Big Bad Wolf said he never used the n-word
He huffs and puffs, he'll snuff you in an alley
But the three little pigs scurry back to Simi Valley
[Money-B]
Goldilocks went to cop some little boy brown
Should've stuck with the snow cause the brown cut her down
[Humpty-Hump]
The itsy-bitsy spider at the National Enquirer
Said the mayor told Naiola to bend over or he'll fire her
[Shock-G]
The freaky old lady in the shoe downtown
Is a brown sugar mommy, wants to pay to lick me down
[Humpty-Hump]
The big bad lady wolf said that she knew me
She huffed and she puffed and she .. mmmmm!
[Shock-G]
Three grinding mice
Trying to mak
