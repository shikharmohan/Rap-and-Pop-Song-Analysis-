Shake your money maker like somebody 'bout to pay ya
I see you on my radar, don't you act like you afraid of shit
You know I got it if you wanna come get it
Stand next to this money like ay, ay, ay
Shake your money maker like somebody 'bout to pay ya
Don't worry about them haters, keep your nose up in the air
You know I got it if you wanna come get it
Stand next to this money like ay, ay, ay
Shake, shake, shake your money maker
Like you were shakin' it for some paper
Took your momma nine months to make ya
Might as well shake what your momma gave ya
You, you lookin' good in them jeans
I bet you'd look even better with me in between
I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind
But you'se a hell of a distraction when you shake your behind
I got J.O. up on my right side, po'n some cups
My whole hood is to my left and they ain't givin' a fuck
So feel free to get loose and get carried away
So by tomorrow you forgot what you were sayin' today
But don't forget about this feelin' that I'm makin' you get
And all the calories you burn from me makin' you sweat
The 'Mile High' points you earn when we takin' my jet
And how everywhere you turn, I'll be makin' you wet
'Cause you can
Shake your money maker like somebody 'bout to pay ya
I see you on my radar, don't you act like you afraid of shit
You know I got it if you wanna come get it
Stand next to this money like ay, ay, ay
Shake your money maker like somebody 'bout to pay ya
Don't worry about them haters, keep your nose up in the air
You know I got it if you wanna come get it
Stand next to this money like ay, ay, ay
Switch, switch, switch it from right to left and
Switch it 'til you runnin' right out of breath and
Take a break until you ready again and
You can invite over as many friends
As you want to but I really want you
Just be thankful that Pharrell gave you somethin' to bump to
Hey, Luda, I'm at the top of my game
You want my hands from the bottom to the top of yo' frame
And I just wanna take a little ride on your curves
And get erotic, givin' your body just what it deserves
And let me give you some swimmin' lessons on the penis
Backstroke, breast stroke, stroke of a genius
Yup, call me the renaissance man
Get up and I stay harder than a cinder block, man
Hey, I'm just a bedroom gangster
And I been meanin' to tell ya
That I really must thank ya when ya
Shake your money maker like somebody 'bout to pay ya
I see you on my radar, don't you act like you afraid of shit
You know I got it if you wanna come get it
Stand next to this money like ay, ay, ay
Shake your money maker like somebody 'bout to pay ya
Don't worry about them haters, keep your nose up in the air
You know I got it if you wanna come get it
Stand next to this money like ay, ay, ay
Release Therapy, rock, rock, rock, rock
Release Therapy, rock, rock, rock, rock
Rock, rock, rock it and make it work, girl
Please don't stop it until it hurt, girl
You, you been lookin' a little tipsy
So if you could, just shake it a little this way
See, I'm a member of the BBC
The original breadwinner of DTP
And you the center of attention that's distractin' the squad
'Cause everybody in the camp is like, "Oh, my God, she could"
Shake your money maker like somebody 'bout to pay ya
I see you on my radar, don't you act like you afraid of shit
You know I got it if you wanna come get it
Stand next to this money like ay, ay, ay
Shake your money maker like somebody 'bout to pay ya
Don't worry about them haters, keep your nose up in the air
You know I got it if you wanna come get it
Stand next to this money like ay, ay, ay
