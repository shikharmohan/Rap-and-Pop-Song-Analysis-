Now there's two things that's the same
In every hood, in every ghetto across the world
And that's struggle, and that's dreams
In my hood, Southside Tallahassee, FL
I had both of those, still got both of those
I'ma let you in on somethin' real quick
Let's take it back to the early '90s
Taleho, Florida is where you'll find me
'78 Omega automobile I'm driving
Bass bamblin' with the wind behind me
Hitch from the attic is the name of the crew
'Coz road shows and hoes that's all we do
And all three P's believe me, we got that hot shit
To the point that nigga 'bout to quit on college
Parents upset 'coz I shat on school
Beat spot got hot so I'm playin' it cool
Crew movin' to New York, I'm 22 years old
My girl's stayin' 'coz she's scared of the cold
Out in the world
(Where you tryin' to make it at)
Out in the world
(Where they tryin' to take it at)
Out in the world
(Where my folk tryin' to get fat)
Out in the world
(And every time get set back)
Out in the world
(Where my dawgs at?)
Out in the world
(Uh huh, fo' sho)
(Where my folk gonna stay strong)
Out in the world
(Niggas move on)
Now I'm in the Brook, how I indicate her
Whole different look, different sound and flavor
Washin' dishes at the Hotel Four Seasons
15 an hour, don't plan on leavin'
Homesick, skippin' work every weekend
Went down, found out my girl was cheatin'
Heart broke, tired, started freakin'
Year later terminated for no reason
Got a new girl as the leaves turn brown
Seein' me stressed said she would hold me down
Had to move to the Bronx where the crooks be juxin'
Sold my first track, moved back to Brooklyn
Music 101, the whole game is dirty
Got me 25, feelin' all of 30
Went from a lover to straight up hustler
Stressed a lot, developed clusters
Out in the world
(Where you tryin' to make it at)
Out in the world
(Where they tryin' to take it at)
Out in the world
(Where my folk tryin' to get fat)
Out in the world
(And every time get set back)
Out in the world
(Where my dawgs at?)
Out in the world
(Uh huh, fo' sho)
(Where my folk gonna stay strong)
Out in the world
(Niggas move on)
2 G, Y2K bug is gone
Put my gas mask back 'coz them lights is on
Dead Prez in the stores and the streets is groovin'
Hi, I'm still broke and my beats is movin'
Gotta grind harder 'coz my bills is major
Got a cell phone, had to dead the pager
Can't blame the game 'coz the game don't feed you
Can't blame the world 'coz the world don't need you
Seem like every excuse I use is see-through
Help myself first, then help my people
'Coz folks sells hope, runnin' scams to burn me
Wash me, comb me, relax and perm me
Gotta get control and stop this car from swerving
Now I'm kinda cold, only the doe concerns me
Try to spend less than the amount I'm earnin'
Lessons everyday I'm learnin'
Out in the world
(Where you tryin' to make it at)
Out in the world
(Where they tryin' to take it at)
Out in the world
(Where my folk tryin' to get phat)
Out in the world
(And every time get set back)
Out in the world
(Where my dawgs at?)
Out in the world
(Uh huh, fo' sho)
(Where my folk gonna stay strong)
Out in the world
(Niggas move on)
