Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
You think them niggaz is hot
Well shawty look what I got
You think I'm lying nigga look what I got
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Shawty look what I got
Ay, pimpin' look what I got, look what I got
My nigga look what I got
Big wheels still spin when I stop
Presidential roll, gold Rolex watch with no rocks
I save them for the pinky keep you niggaz blinkin'
He ain't wearin' platinum, naw but I keep you niggaz thinking
Mink seats sure to keep a nigga sinkin'
Swear he ain't slangin' but I know that nigga creepin'
Got a condo, in Orlando for the weekend
Homes be so crunk in the club we gotta sneak in
No more room in the V.I.P they payin' just to peek in
When they leave they be lookin' in a car they can't even see in
And that's just the beginning in the city that he in
He were rappin' in the cafeteria but now that nigga serious
Heard he got a CL, a EXT on Spreewells
Several Chevy's on 24's, how many records he sell?
Man I don't know but he got a label now them boys, the PSC, hell
I heard Atlantic gave 'em a deal for 2 or 3 mill
Look what I got a old school, a truck and a drop
So next time you think them niggaz is hot, shawty, look what I got
The respect of the niggaz and G's
So next time you say them niggaz is G's, you probably lookin' at me
A what, we ballin' bought the bar for the broads
So next time you think them niggaz is hard, shawty, look at the squad
I'm buyin' yachts, have the streets on lock
So next time you think yo' peeps on top, pimpin', look what I got
I'm well known in the hood like the dope man phone number
Roll anything I can throw some 24's under
Nigga talk bad 'bout the man but I sho wonder
Why the dope boys fuck with 'em and the hoes love 'em
Very little promotions on this album, never heard of 'em
But it's jammin' like the fuck was jumpin' out the stores
'Cause I was born in the raid and I'm made in the streets
I done played in the days in the shade in the streets
I say I rapped in the trap with the best in the streets
I shot craps in the back you know the rest, nigga please
You doin' business with me you best invest in some skills
I sell slopes of snow I don't fuck with little blow nigga
Got 80 K's, gone take a little more
To double up and bring it back and make a little more
And movin' slow, now what you take a nigga for?
I'ma cock hammers and 44's and nail yo ass to the floor
And I ain't braggin', I'm just letting niggaz know
'Cause the media and radio can get a nigga so fucked up
Comparin' me to these niggaz little flow I do a song
Fuck up they whole little show
Look what I got a old school, a truck and a drop
So next time you think them niggaz is hot, shawty, look what I got
The respect of the niggaz and G's
So next time you say them niggaz is G's, you probably lookin' at me
A what, we ballin' bought the bar for the broads
So next time you think them niggaz is hard, shawty, look at the squad
I'm buyin' yachts, have the streets on lock
So next time you think yo' peeps on top, pimpin', look what I got
