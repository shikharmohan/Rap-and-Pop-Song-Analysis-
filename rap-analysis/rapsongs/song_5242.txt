I'm sayin', you could, you could
Just come over top of that shit
Did I hear it?
Nigga an' bang your head, punk
Suck a dick, suck a dick
Suck a dick an' suck a dick
Suck a dick, suck a dick
Suck my dick
It all starts wit the pad an' pen, shall we begin
To burn bush in this rap session, once again
On the run be the Black Stallion
Now you fuckin' wit Ticallion
Iron Lung, boy, me can done, army of one, blaze yo' bun
I'ma get you none, accept challenge
Run a mile wit a racist, they iced it, I aced it
Placed it, right up in their face 'til they faced it
Hard to the dome like a chrome microphone
I'm ba-ba-bad to the bone, to the bone
Danger zone, that's my life an' my song
Keep it movin', hop along, little doggies
Fuck you, drive The Mack Cadillac
Dark shade, the window all sunny an' black
Pitch antenna, back of the car
Inside is a TV, even a bar
Bulletproof down, safe an' sound
Chauffeur in the front just to drive the Lexus all around
Give ya, give ya, give ya body a ride, nice an' warm inside
Come to the Dirt Dog as the tummy rise, enter
Yo, yo, my Wu-Tang cliff'll make yo' atom split
The power of my brain, you can't fathom it
Whoever go against the will of the grain will get slain
Don't ever say thy God name in vain
My third eye electronic dragonfly spiral observe
Can record your words an' your lies an' approach you
An' have my Dogs come an' Ghost you
When it comes to the bread, son, the heat will toast you
Music makes me lose control
This is not just rock 'n' roll
Hip hop digs right to the soul
Music makes me lose control
Wu-Tang, now we on a roll
On a rise, now here we go
Guaranteed to flip the show
RZA beats is outta control
Outta control, outta control
Outta control now here we go
Yo, who got that nigga gassed like he can't get ski masked?
Abducted from his doorstep
Duffle bag his head for the price of nothin'
He's a glutton, what I'm manifestin' each day is a lesson
Y'all fagots came to the School of the 36 Chambers
Copied on papers of scholars that earn dollars
We trend setters in Wu leathers
Trend setters in Wu leathers, whatever
Music makes me lose control
This is not just rock 'n' roll
Hip hop digs right to the soul
Music makes me lose control
Wu-Tang, now we on a roll
On a rise, now here we go
Music makes me lose control
Music makes me lose control
Music makes me lose control
This is not just rock 'n' roll
Hip hop digs right to the soul
Music makes me lose control
Wu-Tang, now we on a roll
On a rise, now here we go
Guaranteed to flip the show
RZA beats is outta control
Outta control, outta control
Outta control, now here we go
