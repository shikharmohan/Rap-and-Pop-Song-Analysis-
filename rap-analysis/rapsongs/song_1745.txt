When you need a good friend, well, here I am
And if you have a problem, I'll be your helping hand
And if you have a bad day, I'll make you a good night
And if you ever lose your way, you know I'll be your guiding light
Just let my love be your pillow
Lay your worries down and rest your head on me
Just let my love be your pillow
Let me turn your life into a beautiful dream
Well, I won't promise you there won't be hard times
We'll share whatever comes down each road of life
And if things turn out wrong, you can turn to me
Let my arms be your blanket when you sleep
Just let my love be your pillow
Lay your worries down, girl, rest your head on me
Just let my love be your pillow
Let me turn your life into a beautiful dream
Let my love be your pillow, yeah
Lay your worries down, girl, rest your head on me
Just let my love be your pillow
Let me turn your life into a beautiful dream
I wanna turn your life into a beautiful dream
