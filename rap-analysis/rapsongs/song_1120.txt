I'm the river that flow through the hood
Through the woods, through the birds, through the mud
Through the bricks over the curves, to the forest reserve
Got with four acres in the forest and worst
Planted [Incomprehensible] for the young seeds to know
Trees is blowin', we see change in the wind
This is new day and I gotta take it in
See a black man run, we need him to win
Young eyes search, search for a better tomorrow
Let belief lead the way and the angels follow
Open doors for the hopeful to go through
'Cause I was chosen and I'm supposed to
I know a change gonna come
The race begun, we're almost there, oh yeah
I know a change gonna come
The race begun, we're almost there, oh yeah
I spoke like a child, I wrote like a child
I always smile, let my mind float like a child
Wishin' I was smart as these kids are now
All grown up still wishin' I'm a child again
Church song reminded me to stay grateful
A [Incomprehensible] reminded me to stay playful
Day's go by, my life all high
I leave all my walks so the fight don't die
And me, I found a purpose why I MC
Inspire a young world to be greater than me
I fall awake and I dream a song
So the little shortys will sing along
I know a change gonna come
The race begun, we're almost there, oh yeah
I know a change gonna come
The race begun, we're almost there, oh yeah
Welcome children, welcome me
Your sentiments is felt in me
I see the future and the walking path
Don't let these fool take you off your path
Laugh if you need to, smile if you need to
Life is a trip ride long and proceed to
Try to believe to, do what you wanna do
Remember you're kings and queens and still humble to
Life isn't fun and you don't need to look back again
Victory can be claimed while you still battling
Travel on with the food I provide you
To awaken the voice that's inside you
I know a change gonna come
The race begun, we're almost there, oh yeah
I know a change gonna come
The race begun, we're almost there, oh yeah
Change is inevitable, you can't stop it
Change is happening in everybody's life
Change is like the furious hurricane that you can't stop
What is change? Change is Martin Luther King Jr., Gandhi
Shakespeare, Tupac Shakur, Barack Obama
And you can't forget Common
Change is gonna happen, change is hope
