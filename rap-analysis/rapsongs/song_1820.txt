Yeah, in the name of Jesus, spread the word
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
And every turn that rise against my judgment
Thou shall condemn, Lord, give me a sign
For this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord
"And their righteousness is of me," said the Lord
Amen, Lord, give me a sign
I really need talk to You, Lord
Since the last time we talked, the walk has been hard
Now I know You haven't left me but I feel like I'm alone
I'ma big boy now but I'm still not grown
And I'm still goin' through it, pain and the hurt
Soakin' up trouble like rain in the dirt
And I know, only I can stop the rain
With just the mention of my Savior's name
In the name of Jesus
Devil, I rebuke you for what I go through
You been tryna make me do what I used to
But all that stops right here
As long as the Lord's in my life, I will have no fear
I will know no pain, from the light to the dark
I will no show no shame, spit it right from the heart
'Cause it's right from the start, you held me down
And ain't nothin' they can tell me now
Lord, give me a sign
Let me know what's on Your mind
Let me know what I'm gon' find
It's all in time, show me how to teach the mind
Show me how to reach the blind
Lord, give me a sign
Show me what I gotsta do to bring me closer to You
As I'ma go through whatever You want me to
Just let me know what to do
Lord, give me a sign
Please, show me some'n
I'm tired talkin' to him, knowin' he frontin'
Cryin' 'bout, "Life ain't nothin'"
But you either be the one mad
'Cause you trapped or the one huntin'
Trapped in yo' own mind, waitin' on the Lord
Or huntin' with the word that cuts like a sword
The spoken word is stronger than the strongest man
Carries the whole world like the strongest hand
Through the trials and tribulations, You never let us down
Jesus, I know You're here with us now
Jesus, I know You're still with us now
Keep it real with us now, I wanna feel, show me how
Please, let me take Your hand, guide me
I'll walk slow but stay right beside me
Devil's tryna find me
Hide me, hold up, I take that back
Protect me and give me the strength to fight back
Lord, give me a sign
Let me know what's on Your mind
Let me know what I'm gon' find
It's all in time, show me how to teach the mind
Show me how to reach the blind
Lord, give me a sign
Show me what I gotsta do to bring me closer to You
As I'ma go through whatever You want me to
Just let me know what to do
Lord, give me a sign
Life or death, live or die
I will never live a lie
I'm gon' get because I try
I won't quit until I die
I'm gon' make it, wrong or right
And make it through the darkest time
And when the morning comes, you'll see
That all I have is God in me
Lord, give me a sign
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Lord, give me a sign
For this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord
In the name of Jesus
Lord, give me a sign
Let me know what's on Your mind
Let me know what I'm gon' find
It's all in time, show me how to teach the mind
Show me how to reach the blind
Lord, give me a sign
Show me what I gotsta do to bring me closer to You
As I'ma go through whatever You want me to
Just let me know what to do
Lord, give me a sign
