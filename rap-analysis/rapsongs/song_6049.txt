Quiet nights and quiet stars, quiet chords from my guitar
Floating on the silence that surrounds us
Quiet thoughts and quiet dreams, quiet walks by quiet streams
Climbing hills where lovers go to watch the world below together
We will live eternally in this mood of reverie
Away from all the earthly cares around us
My world was dull, each minute, until I found you in it
And all at once, the happiness I knew
Became these quiet nights of loving you
We will live eternally in this mood of reverie
Away from all the earthly cares around us
My world was dull, each minute, until I found you in it
And all at once, the happiness I knew
Became these quiet nights of loving you
