Mr. West is in the building
Swagga on a hundred thousand, trillion
Ayo I know I got it first
I'm Christopher Columbus, y'all just the pilgrims
Thanksgiving, do we even gotta question?
Hermes, Pastelle, I pass the dressing
My attitude is tattooed
That means it's permanent so I guess I should address it, huh?
My swagga is Mick Jagger
Every time I breathe on the track I asthma attack it
"Why ya so mad for it? Why ya gotta have it?"
'Cause I slaved my whole life, now I'm the master
Na-na-na
How it feel to wake up and be the shit and the urine?
Na-na-na-na-na
Trying to get that Kobe number, one over Jordan

(No one on the corner)
Got a bop like this
Can't wear skinny jeans 'cause my knots don't fit
No one on the corner got a pocket like this
So I rock Roc jeans 'cause my knots so thick
You can learn how to dress just by checkin' my fresh
Checkin' checkin' my fresh, checkin' checkin' my fresh
Follow my steps, it's the road to success
Where the niggas lookin' feral when the girls say yes
But I can't teach you my swag
You can pay for school but you can't buy class
School of hard knocks, I'm a grad
In that all-blue Yankee, it's my graduation cap
It's Hova!
Dippin' different Rovers, whippin' with the soda
Hova!
Could you even have any doubt? After doubt if it's over
No one on the corner have swagga like us
Swagga like us, swagga swagga like us
No one on the corner have swagga like us
Swagga like us, swagga swagga like us
No one on the corner have swagga like us
Swagga like us, swagga swagga like us
No one on the corner have swagga like us
Swagga like us, swagga swagga like us
No one on the corner has swagga like moi
Church but I'm too clean for these boys
I require what I desire
I got stripes, Adidas
Mami scream, "Papi, no mas!"
Run up in your shit, just me, no mas
Runnin' this shit like I got four thighs
No one has swagga like these four gods!
And when it comes to styles, I got several
Sharper than a swagga, dagger all metal
And my jewels, blue and yellow
The type of shit that make 'em call you Carmelo
Rules as follows, stay true to the ghetto
Write your name on a bullet, make you feel special
Ha! What the fuck you boys talkin' 'bout?
I know it's us 'cause we the only thing to talk about
No one on the corner have swagga like us
Swagga like us, swagga swagga like us
No one on the corner have swagga like us
Swagga like us, swagga swagga like us
No one on the corner have swagga like us
Swagga like us, swagga swagga like us
No one on the corner have swagga like us
Swagga like us, swagga swagga like us
You can go see Weezy for the wordplay, Jeezy for the birdplay
Kanyeezy for diversity and me for controversy
All my verses picture perfect, only spittin' certain purpose
If you ain't living what you kickin' then you worthless
Lookin' from the surface it may seem like I got reason to be nervous
Then observe my work and see that my adversity was worth it
Verses autobiographical, absolutely classical
Last thing I'm worried about is what another rapper do
Ain't nobody hot as me even if they rap they ass off
Blast off and have outstandin' quality
Sell a lotta records, I respected and salute that
But spittin' real life on hot beats, I'm the truth at
You kick it like me, no exaggeration necessary
Livin' revolutionary, nothin' less than legendary
Gangsta shit hereditary, got it from my dad
Flow colder than February with extraordinary swag
