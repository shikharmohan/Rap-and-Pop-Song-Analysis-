A letter to you suckers
Each and every one of you duck mothafuckers
Your girl puckers her lips so I stuck her
You're tellin' me, yo, so what the hell you tellin' me?
Now I'm-a show you fuckin' with me is a felony
I'm crushin', tell you suckers to start hushin'
Shush, no discussion, 'cuz I'm-a start rushin'
The payback and I attack the pack that's wack
The black mack, brown like a cracker jack
Slick and quick, I got pick a bic to stick
To kick some shit, chicks I dick with the One
Give up the fun with the gun, my son
I don't run, I kick mothafuckers done
It don't matter, I make niggas scatter
Teeth start to chatter, your head I'm-a splatter arraigned
Breakin' to maintain and watchin' my name bring you pain
I'm standin' on your blood stain hard to hold
I'm bold, I roll real cold
Too much soul, dick made of gold
I rolled niggas to hell; you tried to swell but fell
Now get well or die like a dry cell, a rap villain
Chillin' and I don't give a fuck about a killin'
'Cuz I'm still in effect when you're illin'  terrorist
I terrorize like an assassin
Yes, I'm trespassin', your ass I'm harassin', huh
Talk is cheap, I'm keepin' ya six feet deep
So don't sleep when I creep, you'll leap like athletes slammin'
Examine what I'm jammin'
Hey, I don't play, I burn like a gamma ray
Labeled prey, played to pave the way
Mothafuckers are scared straight
Check this out
The creature feature, searcher, preacher, teacher
Taught to rough the cap to rap to ya and reach ya
Musical master, mind reacts as a brain
That has the knowledge is answered
You're just a Kit Kat, on some Tic-Tacs
But I'm a Big Mac, cuz I'm G Rap
Fully equipped with a hip hop lip
My memory bank is like a microchip
My bass will give a shake, or if not quake
It'll make you, sucker MC, wanna jump in the lake
'Cuz I'm murder, homicide, color
Must kill and destroy with excitement and drama
Weakest, I'll seek her, you become weaker
My art is the smoke, my materials and media
So rap alert for ya, devastate the area
I'll give a grain of your lyrical mania
Power source, and a G enforced, your headboards
And they could be rap wars
So come one or two, 'cept for a few
Doubles and couples and I'll grip 'em like tools
'Cuz boy, you can't handles this
None or any, one or many, some or plenty
'Cuz I'm not the stranger, just the rhyme arranger
Highly explosive, keep out, danger
Packin' Gs while you try to beat me
But for these MCs who go on and wannabe Gs
What I write is in a smoking section
Here's an injection of rap perfection
So what the heck, you select my dialect
Next man's cassette, yo, reject and eject
'Cuz I could use a technique, smart as an antique
Beats that I repeat show you that I can speak
Totally, probably, you rappers wanna copy me
It takes strategy just like Monopoly, figure it out
Kool G Rap is about makin' armies and crews look like girl scouts
'Cuz when I start rappin', I keep the people clappin'
Suckers that be yappin' won't think that this'll happen
Yo, MCs, all wannabe Kanes and Chuck Ds, skeeze, Fs, Gs
Rock Shantes, Ks, L M N O Ps hit the backs of my reeds, facsimilies
Freeze, catch the wave, later, rappers got the alphabet
But I'm an Alpha Beta Kappa rappers, they form my alumni
Step to this if you're prejudiced, peace
