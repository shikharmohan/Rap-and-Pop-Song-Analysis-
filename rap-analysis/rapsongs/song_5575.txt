Is it real like niggaz claimin', "Stay to this"
Let me answer that question while I'm aiming this
Hear them one good time, is he faking kid?
Not bleeding like that, he gonna need a shit bad
Lay the fuck up, suck it through from a tube
A million dollars won't even put my feet in his shoes
Niggaz lose they life, hear as nature
And niggaz die when tryin', I'm gangsta, niggaz
Straight pussy, I can smell that shit
There's only one way that I can duse that shit
Slugs comin' through, better move that shit
He was gangsta but he died tryin' ta prove that shit
Them QB niggaz too grimy for y'all
We stick together, fuck what you heard in the song
The 41st Side and that love go long
Niggaz screamin' out, dunn and we put y'all on
So fuck y'all niggaz, buck y'all niggaz
Ain't no way you can touch my niggaz
Try my nigga, die my nigga
All y'all niggaz, my gats spittin'
So fuck y'all niggaz, buck y'all niggaz
Ain't no way you can touch my niggaz
Try my nigga, die my nigga
All y'all niggaz, my gats spittin'
Aiyo, you feel my niggaz when we come through, thuggin' it
You lovin' it, the way we at ball like the government
I'm 1/3 President, the AB, the medicine, we OD heavenly
You fuckin' with veterans who's better than us, the In-fa-mous
We crush crab niggaz to dust and sweep-o-mop
When the heat raise up, ain't no ifs, ands, or buts
The most scandalous, make your blood rush
Through your body like it ain't never did before
We the mall and we guarantee the realist of all
My spirit is torn, my guns is long, my team is strong
We King Kong niggaz when the heat is on
And no matter if I'm wrong or right, believe me, I'm right
If anything else, nigga prepare to fight
Like, knuckle up, get your face bowl up
Or buckle up and get shot the fuck down
'Cause we got four pounds that don't make no sounds
Real creepy, so be careful when you see me, breathe easy
Believe me, it's far from what you see on TV
It's real life drama, you wouldn't want to be me
So fuck y'all niggaz, buck y'all niggaz
Ain't no way you can touch my niggaz
Try my nigga, die my nigga
All y'all niggaz, my gats spittin'
So fuck y'all niggaz, buck y'all niggaz
Ain't no way you can touch my niggaz
Try my nigga, die my nigga
All y'all niggaz, my gats spittin'
Aiyo, there ain't no niggaz on the face of the map
Fuckin' with this infamous, y'all, that dominant mall
Just park your attention on my dogs, it's us
We the ones with that dope shit, that cold crush
We burn 'em up, turn it up, it's on
We gonna do it till it death us, fuck yo' thoughts
Niggaz be plottin' to dead us, they move in vain
Get they head bust open, it's not a thing
So rap fo' these niggaz, my team is tough
It's not a game, motherfucka, we cleanin' up
Gettin' that money, motherfucka, you king or what
We use your head, dunn, it's right there, get you some
You lack strength, motherfucka, better get you some
For's me, I'm more than a family, dunn, and we handles our business
And continue to bang and chump niggaz
Grow and get bigger, flow and get richer
So fuck y'all niggaz, buck y'all niggaz
Ain't no way you can touch my niggaz
Try my nigga, die my nigga
All y'all niggaz, my gats spittin'
So fuck y'all niggaz, buck y'all niggaz
Ain't no way you can touch my niggaz
Try my nigga, die my nigga
All y'all niggaz, my gats spittin'
