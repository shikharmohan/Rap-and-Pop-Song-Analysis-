I just touched down in killa Cali, strapped up my boots
Got scooped up by Game so I hopped up in the coupe
Gah, what up nigga? What the hell is goin' on?
I'm tryin' to ease back and get my head in the zone
Where the fuck you tryin' to go? Nigga this yo' city
Anywhere, I'm just tryin' to see some ass and titties
So full mash the gas, the night is young
All bull shit aside I'm tryin' to have some fun
Hit the hop in Lakewood or ride down Slawson
Or to Casino they say it's just like Compton
Really doesn't matter long as shots don't ring out
Nigga, I stay strapped, I don't wanna pull the thing out
Well, keep the heat, heat right up under the seat
And let's roll to Roscoe's and grab somethin' to eat
But check ya rear view mirror, I swear somebody's followin'
Rollin' in that dark blue SS Impala and all up on the bumpa
Man, I'm just sayin' tell me you know this nigga
No, they betta stop playin'
He sped up around and drove right in front of us
Could be one time just tryin' to bust one of us
Till he smashed the brakes and we almost hit him
Throwin' signs out the window like somethin' was wrong with him
Before we jump out and get ready to clown
Nigga call up the homies it's about to go down
Keep one eye open 'cause the streets don't sleep
If the streets get hungry then the streets gon' eat
That's why I keep some heat and a couple of rounds
Nigga, call up the homies it's about to go down
Call up the homies it's about to go down
Yeah, call up the homies it's about to go down
Yeah, that's why I keep some heat and a couple of rounds
Nigga call up the homies it's about to go down
Somebody tell Luda I'm on the way now
Aight, just stepped one size twelve Air Force One in the A-town
And you know where I'm headed, to the Lennox Mall
To get it done head to toe NWA Style
Do it then, keep it gangsta from the waist down
And this chrome tre pound got me feelin' Atlanta Brave now
Right, disturbin' the peace I'll let the lead spray
I'm startin' to love this place, they even got red clay
Okay, hit a different strip club everyday
And I don't make it rain, it's a hurricane on the way
And I got the A-town pump
It'll make ya whole body do the A-town stomp
Then it's off to the waffle house and pancake mix
Ain't the only thing comin' out of mouth
And the forty two D's comin' out her blouse
So baby, daddy comin' in, Game get out the house
Keep one eye open 'cause the streets don't sleep
If the streets get hungry then the streets gon' eat
That's why I keep some heat and a couple of rounds
Nigga call up the homies it's about to go down
Call up the homies it's about to go down
Yeah, call up the homies it's about to go down
Yeah, that's why I keep some heat and a couple of rounds
Nigga call up the homies it's about to go down
Yeah, I'm in a real life movie so this is take three
Where Luda step foot out in Phoenix, AZ
Super Bowl, super hoes, drivers on stroll
So I put the call in to Willie Northpole
Big homie I got ya, stick to ya like a cactus
Welcome to the bird city, Cris take off ya jacket
I know you kind of used to big bootys in the club
But ain't nothin' wrong to have a little salsa in ya blood
I see a couple thugs with some bitch Tennessee
My town but I still got Phoenix enemies
Haters wanna stop 'em and I really wanna pop 'em
But it's hard to fight back when you got an album droppin'
Connect, we in south Phoenix, niggas Africa bang
Matter fact Cris tuck in ya Africa chain, what?
'Cause I see some nigga starin' at us with a lame frown
I'm a call up the homies it's about to go down
Keep one eye open 'cause the streets don't sleep
If the streets get hungry then the streets gon' eat
That's why I keep some heat and a couple of rounds
Nigga call up the homies it's about to go down
Call up the homies it's about to go down
Yeah, call up the homies it's about to go down
Yeah, that's why I keep some heat and a couple of rounds
Nigga call up the homies it's about to go down
