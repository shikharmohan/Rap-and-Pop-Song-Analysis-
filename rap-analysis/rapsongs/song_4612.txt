Yes sir oh we got coming up like I said
Shorty on the Lookout featuring that bad man Median
Ah from Justus League, check it all ch'all, WJLO bam
The future of hip hop music
Shorty hit the brakes too late
Shorty hit the brakes too late
Shorty hit the brakes too late
Hey yo rollin' out the crib about a quarter to six
Fresh Tims, bubble goose all in the mix
Y'all niggaz know my stee's and how crazy I get
I'm lookin' for the broad shaking ass and tips
I got the J-League bangin' hard out the whip
Picked up the phone and hit my nigga Pooh on sip
I got the call from 'Te about a quarter to eight
Don't about y'all niggaz but I sure look great
I went to change that's how I meet in place
There go 'Te and all damn he always late
Hop in the whip it's the Leagues new shit
What up with this chicks yo I'm trying to hit
Hey yo these chicks around here ain't trying to give me no play
They mad at my verse from whatever you say
Yo sorry about the shirt dog I'll hit you with play
You still rockin' that punch from the video day
We about to take it over to a Median stay
So we just bounce to the beat, bounce, rock and sway
Shorty hit the brakes too late
Looking at me 'cause I am just keeping it thorough
Shorty hit the brakes too late
We shine it right for every man, child, woman and girl
And to my man's in it, and my peeps in it and my girls in it
Put your world in it
Shorty hit the brakes too late
Looking at us 'cause we on top of the world
Shorty hit the brakes too late
And every state, every city, every town and girl
And to my freaks in it, and the fam' in it and the ladies in it
It's all gravy in it
Hey that nigga Median ain't never at home
He trying to be a player like Rome and Dome
Probably at a coffee shop trying to bone
Gassing up these chicks like Sharon Stone
Got these young broads thinking that they grown
Nigga need to go and get a cellular phone
'Te I see him at a party just last week
He had him around his arm a little dark skin freak
MC on the tables on the mic you meet
Broads around Median trying to speak
I guess that's the life walking in his shoes
All we need now is a dutch and a brew
It's mid-December in here
Seventy degrees and the skies are clear
Feels so good like the vein in hear
Do them stars and them stripes mean the ended is near?
No time got evicted got a crib to clear
Move on don't stop house parties and all
Shorty hit the brakes too late
  (And we going to ball till the break of dawn)
Looking at me 'cause I am just keeping it thorough
Shorty hit the brakes too late
We shine it right for every man, child, woman and girl
To my man's in it, and my peeps in it and my girls in it
Put your world in it
Shorty hit the brakes too late
Looking at us 'cause we on top of the world
Shorty hit the brakes too late
And every state, every city, every town and girl
And to my freaks in it, and the fam' in it and the ladies in it
It's all gravy in it
Man where you been, we trying to lay this jam
All we here is songs, the invisible man
Girls they go hard get giddy and stuff
That's why we want you we ain't pretty enough
To the Nissan we going to lay these plans
Next week we record it at Missy Yyan's
Probably think I be playing with this
I can hear them niggaz Pooh and Phonte in this shit
If only they could know a brother holdin' it down
Grindin' for the day that we controllin' it now
To the break of dawn to the break of dawn
Flows hot just open up your mind baby
The blind lead the blind make the grind crazy
Why maybe, just co-signed baby
Median would like to know your mind baby
J-Lizzy is about to blow your mind baby
Lunch time, crunch time, punch line baby
Our time now, what is that, a crime baby?
Shorty hit the brakes too late
Looking at me 'cause I am just keeping it thorough
Shorty hit the brakes too late
We shine it right for every man, child, woman and girl
To my man's in it, and my peeps in it and my girls in it
Put your world in it
Shorty hit the brakes too late
Looking at us 'cause we on top of the world
Shorty hit the brakes too late
And every state, every city, every town and girl
And to my freaks in it, and the fam' in it and the ladies in it
It's all gravy in it
