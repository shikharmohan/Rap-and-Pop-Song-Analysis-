You make me smile with my heart, oh
Why everything that's supposed to be bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man, I tried to stop, man, I tried the best I could but
(You make me smile)
What's your addiction? Is it money? Is it girls? Is it weed?
I've been afflicted by not one, not two, but all three
She's got the same thing about me but more about us
So, she's comin' over, so I guess that means I'm on drugs
  (You make me smile)
Just let me peek now, I mean damn, I'm so curious
She's got a lover, so the lies and the lust is a rush
Time's of the essence, I need you to be spontaneous
Roll up the doja, henny and C-c-cola, then I'm c-comin' over
  (You make me smile with my heart)
'Cuz its ne-never over
(Oh)
Why everything that's supposed to be bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man, I tried to stop, man, I tried the best I could but
(You make me smile)
I see the emotion in your eyes that you try not to show
We get the closest when you high or you drunk or you blow
So I pour the potion so we could both get high as we can go
Then I'll get the lotion
And do something to me when your thighs is exposed
  (You make me smile)
There's no turnin' back now, I mean I don't mean to impose
Not now but right now, I need you to undress and then pose
I'm into that now, catch a vibe when the doors get closed
Roll up the doja, henny and C-c-cola and I keep c-comin' over
  (You make me smile with my heart)
'Cuz it's ne-never over
(Oh)
Ahh, why everything's supposed to be bad make me feel so good?
  (Na na na na na na)
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would

Man, I tried to stop, man, I tried the best I could but

Na na na na na

I just wanted to ask you
Just wanted to, umm
Tell me, how would I put this, uhh?
Let's say, all your friends
Remember the one, huh?
You said, if you ever she would be the one
Okay, okay, okay
  (You make me smile with my heart, oh)
Well, I was thinking hypothetically
I mean, don't take this seriously
Don't take me, I mean just, uhh, not credibly
I feel it incredibly, I mean, let's say that we
Uh, just let it be
I mean you, her and me, I mean you, her and me

You know I was just kidding
Unless you gon' do it
