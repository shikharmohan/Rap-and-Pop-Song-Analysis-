Remix, haa
Luda
We gon do this one for the ATL right
So check this out it goes something like thisÃ¢Â¦
Ok, Fresh pair J's on my feet thats how I do it
If you scuff my J's then we gon have to get into it
Snuff you with my right then I'll deck you with my other hand
And you might get a little hit but I'll bounce back just like a rubber band
Blaaaaw, all up in your muthaf-cking face
I'll buss your bottom lip come get a muthf-cking taste
DPG see me on TV better not mistake me for no sucker
Cos the 4-4 make em hit the flo flo and say you make em run for cover cover
Cover your eyes and cover your mouth when a grown man talking
I'm swaggin, Im surfin matter of fact thats how im walking,
Walking it out, but on the other hand Im walking it in when it comes to the pa-pa-paper
Drink conjure straight that means no cha cha cha cha chaser
Thats right conjure conjure conjure no I don't drink no more Vodka
So find me gettin' slizzerd at the bar with Woka Flocka
Man its bazula shocker can't touch me like Osama
Other rappers need to cover they face up like Lady Gagaaaaaa
Aaaaaaaaaaah
