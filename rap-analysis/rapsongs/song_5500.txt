The most violent of the violent lest crimes we give life to
If these Queens Bridge kids don't like you
We bring drama of the worst kind of enemies
Your first time would be your last earth memories
It's only your own fault, I gave you fair warning
Beware of killa kids who don't care
Unaware fools who be dealt with in time
It ain't a mystery
Hop on the words and rhyme
In nineteenth hundred and ninety square
All shook niggaz is supposed to have fear
Trying to get a piece of this pie we don't share
Prepare for the worst 'cuz I been there
Try tah, keep a positive mind and walk a straight line don't work
So niggaz is forced to do dirt and God made
So this jerk wouldn't hurt
If I listen to the lessons and the rules I learn
On the streets for nineteenth years and not leaving
My first priority is to reach twenty one breathing
Forever beef nobody would ever be even
So I grab the heat before breathing
Lost in this foul mind state I can't keep straight thinking
But I keep my eyes on the earth without blinking
It's hard to be a man in this land of the venom
Any man try to front he get slugs in him because
He ain't a crook son
Son, he just shook one
Shook one
We live the life that of diamonds and guns
And numerous ways that we choose to earn funds, earn funds
Some niggaz get shot, locked down and turned nuns
Cowardly hearts send straight up shook ones, shook ones
He ain't a crook son
He just a shook one
Shook one
For every rhyme I write is 25 to life to all my peoples in the Bridge
Know what I'm talking 'bout, right ain't no time for hesitation
That only leads to incarceration you don't know me, there's no relation
'Cuz Queens niggas don't play
I don't got time for the he say, she say I'm bigga than dat
Claiming that you packing gats but you scared to get locked
Once you get upon the Island change your ways and stop
Thirteen years in the projects, my hard times of living
Wake up in the morning thank God I'm still living
Sometimes I wonder, do I deserve to live?
Or I am going to hell for all the shit I did
No time to dwell on that 'cuz my brain reacts
Front if you want nigga lay on ya back
I don't fake jax kid, you know I bring it to ya live
Stay in a child's place, kid you outta line
Criminal mind thirsty for recognition mission
I'm strictly sipping E and J like got my mind flipping
I'm buggin' diggin' over hustling get that loot kid
You know my motherfucking function
'Cause as long as I'm alive I'ma live illegal
And once I get it I'ma put it on my people
React quick to lyrics like macs I hit your dome up
When I roll up, don't get caught sleepin' 'cuz I'm creepin'
You just a shook one
He ain't a crook son
Son, he just shook one
Shook one
We live the life that of diamonds and guns
And numerous ways that we choose to earn funds
Some niggaz get shot, locked down and turned nuns
Cowardly hearts send straight up shook ones, shook ones
He ain't a crook son
He just a shook one
Shook one
We live the life that of diamonds and guns
And numerous ways that we choose to earn funds
Some niggaz get shot, locked down and turned nuns
Cowardly hearts send straight up shook ones, shook ones
He ain't a crook son, crook son
He just a shook one
Shook one
Yeah
