Yeah, shit's going down again
These motherfuckers want me back in, fuck
Word up, our niggas is strapped, ready for war
  (Try to get the ski mask)
Word up, our niggas is strapped, ready for war
  (Get out the H-K)
Word up, our niggas is strapped, ready for war
  (Fuck!)
Word up, our niggas is strapped, ready for war
Niggas talking crazy 'cause they say
That I kill one of they motherfuckers, sucker ass busters
Did he? Did not, I got drama with them niggas from the other side
Call my nigga Rich and he's right
Fuck them niggas, I got a truck full of 38, some bullet shields
Ice, we can send this niggas all to hell
I never like them niggas from the gat, go
Used to breakin' my craps and fuck all they motherfuckin' hoes
Made another car-hit, 30 Killers on the hip
Ready to rock, packin' Magnums and glocks
Man connections, who trips the question?
Niggas on the way to play in a laser rain
Nigga, you got two strikes and I got two strikes
We can't afford the Lino, fuckin witness tonight
But if this is what they want, it's like Christmas to me
It's been a long time since the Big Rich caught a body
Fuck it, I like the way you think my man
I pack 20 motherfuckers in the Astro van
We bash and crib about 12:30, dirty
Nigga, be ready to roll, I know you heard me
Nigga, it's on, so don't trip, I'm down
I got soul dough shawty and I'm ready to clown
Bless the nigga in the face, kill his fuckin hoe
Ice, you don't did this kind of shit with me before
Word up, our niggas is strapped, ready for war
Word up, our niggas is strapped, ready for war

Word up, our niggas is strapped, ready for war
Word up, our niggas is strapped, ready for war
Niggaz wanted ill but my nigga get iller
Streets full of hardcore stone-face killers
One love, my nigga, Big Rich puff bud
I don't get high, I wanna see some niggas die
Yo, some niggas hit the corner with the lights off, Ice
That shit don't look nothin' nice
But if these niggas wanna roll in my hood, yo, then fuck it
Break out the whole world, boys, blow up the fuckin' bucket
Niggaz pulled out, my crew is ready
Me turn the fire, rock the punks steady
When they shoot and stop, car look like confetti
Went my ass home, jump back in the bed, G
You one, why they wanna fuck with us
When they know my posse is crazy and they down to bust
Big Rich, take no shit from these busta ass tricks
Check your punk ass nigga like I check a bitch
I got no love for no nigga flippin', trippin' on my fam
Goddamn, I make L.A. hot as Vietnam
But ill niggas should be left alone
Please excuse me while I rest my dome
