Here we go, here we go, let's get it
It's Young Jizzle and I'm back with Timbo
With another hit, ya still stuck in a limbo
An adlib here and an adlib there
*** it, adlibs everywhere
As I proceed to give ya what you need
Spit tre drop, *** cocoa leaves
A-Town pimp, tell me what you know about it
Wanna talk ***, I'll tell ya what I know about it
I'm on that Grey Goose, higher than a pelican
Sophomore year, but I spit it like a veteran
Gangsta, gangsta, you can tell by the swag
And it's fresh off the lot, you can tell by the tag, what's up?
It's about 3 in the morning
Gotta leave with somethin' hot 'cause a *** horny
Now I'm in the parking lot, baby all over me
Ay, ay, wait a minute ha, let's go
It's about 3 in the morning
Got my thang, cocked 'cause them boys they be on it
**** they be talkin' but, they don't really want it, what ya say?
Ay, ay, wait a minute ha, let's go
The flow's so cold and I'm so cool
Let a *** try, I'mma act a damn fool
Got that welfare, we call it old school
Then we mix it all up, call it pro tools
Serve 'em demo tracks, let 'em demo that
All these *** in the club, where the bad ones at?
She got a mean walk, I got a big stick
I see ya muggin' homie, I got a full clip
See I master that and then I mastered this
Then I bring it all back, I gotta master wrist
I was on dro and she was on Hen
She was on her and I was zonin', let's get it
It's about 3 in the morning
Gotta leave with somethin' hot 'cause a *** horny
Now I'm in the parking lot, baby all over me
Ay, ay, wait a minute ha, let's go
It's about 3 in the morning
Got my thang, cocked 'cause them boys they be on it
**** they be talkin' but, they don't really want it, what ya say?
Ay, ay, wait a minute ha, let's go
Verse three, I'm back to the basics
Fresh out the jeweler, came back with the bracelet
Blowing haze yeah, dog, I can taste it
Parked the 430 came back in a spaceship
And my whip game is so sick mayne
I double up every time I flip mayne
Birds by the flocks, clips in the glocks
Multi-platinum, still watchin' for the cops
Ya girl keep sweating me, she staring at my rocks
Me I'm gee'd up, grabbing on my, huh?
I walk it how I talk it, play it how I say it
Me and Timb on the track, but everybody play it
It's about 3 in the morning
Gotta leave with somethin' hot 'cause a *** horny
Now I'm in the parking lot, baby all over me
Ay, ay, wait a minute ha, let's go
It's about 3 in the morning
Got my thang, cocked 'cause them boys they be on it
**** they be talkin' but, they don't really want it, what ya say?
Ay, ay, wait a minute ha, let's go
