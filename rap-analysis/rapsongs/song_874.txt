So run your jewels and your ones too
Hey my bitches

Bounce and hold your ass out
Make it open and close shut
Watch me bust a whole nut
Right over your whole butt
Slice you down with the dick
Just like you was a cold cut
(Oh fuck)
Now watch me dig all in your whole gut
Stuff it like a roast duck
Fuckin' packin' a toast

Smokin' till we high zonin'
Niggas on the corner
Clutter the streets in the nights roamin'

Bitches if your ridin' with me

Reppin' for my bitches and my niggas too

Bounce and shake your ass out
Break fool and black out
Hit you with some shit
That will make all y'all just pass out

Fuck up your block shit

On some straight cock your glock shit
Every time we drop shit
There's no way to stop shit
Bust y'all niggas ass
Then like to sit back and pop shit
Yo we bout to lace y'all
Deface the place y'all
With shit that feel just like
A fuckin' foot in your face y'all
Is you with me?
(Hell yeah)
Before I hit y'all
Flipmode be the niggas
That will be sure to split y'all
We will never quit y'all
We won't permit y'all
Whack niggas to come inside

Yeah you know we blaze
And we wreck shop
Put it down for live niggas
While we watch the next fly
All my niggas pass through
Before we blast you
This shit so real
I don't have no need to gash you
We will never calm down
We won't put the bombs down
Rep for all my niggas
And we won't put the arms down
(Yeah you know we keep it comin')
Yo people is good for nothin', ay yo
Hot to death with shit that always keep you jumpin'
And rush the dance hall
Until all they ass fall
I make you other corny niggas
Get off the damn wall
And then we bless y'all
With the currently fresh y'all
And hit y'all niggas with flavor
Nothing less than the best y'all
