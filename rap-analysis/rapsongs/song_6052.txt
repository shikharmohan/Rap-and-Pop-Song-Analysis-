My baby, she may not look like one of those bunnies out of the
Playboy book well, I'm sorry 'bout that, Mr. Williams but she's
Got something Johnny, much greater than gold well, now
What's that? I'm crazy 'bout that girl, she's got so much soul
She's got the kind of loving, kissin' and a-huggin'
Sure is mellow, glad that I'm her fellow
And I know that she knocks me off my feet
Have mercy on me 'cause she knocks me off my feet
Can you dig it?
There is no girl in the whole world
That can love me like you do ow
Tell 'em bout it, Watson
My baby now, when she walks by
All the fellows go [unverified] and I know why
Have mercy, just look at her walk
It's simply because that girl, she walks so fine
And if she ever leave me, I will lose my mind
Because she's got the kind of lovin', kissin' and a-huggin'
Sure is mellow, glad that I'm her fellow
And I know that she knocks me off my feet
Have mercy on me! 'Cause she knocks me off my feet
I'd better tell 'em one more thing
There is no girl in the whole world
That can love me like you do
Ow, tell 'em 'bout it, Mr. Williams
Now everybody in my neighborhood
An' that's what's grooving me will testify that my girl, she looks so good
Well, let me tell you something else right here
She looks so fine, she give eyesight to the blind
Help 'em to make 'em see and if she ever leave me, I will lose my mind
Because she's got the kind of lovin'
Kissin' and a-huggin' sure is mellow, glad that I'm her fellow
And I know that she knocks me off my feet
Have mercy on me 'cause she knocks me off my feet
Can you dig it?
There is no girl in the whole world
That can love me like you do
Mercy, mercy, mercy
