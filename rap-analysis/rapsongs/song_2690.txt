Why don't ya'll take a look into my life?
See what I see
At the age of fourteen, introduce to coops
Learnin' how to seduce niggaz, takin' they loot
Quickly, got involved with this money lifestyle
The finer things, all kinda things, power, money
Cars and diamond rings, and nice braids, flaunt it
The Gucci boots with the G's on it
A high price for this 'High price' life
While I'm on tour is my man cheatin' just for spite?
And if you only knew I hold my minks at nights with cheap
Or no other hands can hold me right
My girls ain't the same, guess it's 'cuz the fame
Bitches smile in my face and throw dirt on my name
Mad 'cuz I made it, now friends intimidated
Hate it that I'm in the same game as them
With mo' fame than them, they know who they are
This life is no joke, got us havin' to broke
You was my sister, who used to dream together
How we could make it real big, do our thing together
Huh, Thelma and Louise together, remember them days?
Them niggas we played? Now we don't even speak
Went our seperate ways, seperate lives
Lost friendship for pride, playin' the game
About to forfeit high price life, I can't afford it
My life, do ya feel what I feel?
My life, a black girl's ordeal my life
Do ya see what I see?
Have you been where I've been?
Can you go where I go?
My life
Do ya'll know what it feels like?
Do ya'll know what it be like?
Do ya see what I see?
Have you been where I've been?
Can you go where I go?
Daddy's girl, in his wildest dreams
Said he think that lil' Ing will be illest in this rap -thing
Age four in my mother's shoes, swore I could sing
And even as a little girl I was doin' my thing
Uh, confused, I ain't asked to be born
Nigga so dumb, shoulda used a condom
Ask mommy every day, when daddy gon' come?
But he never showed up
I would pimp for them, became demented, then men?
Resented them, just the scent of 'em made me hurl
Specially the baller ones tryin' to buy me with pearls
All I needed was love, all I wanted was love
Lack of love had me fallin' for thugs
The niggas who ain't care, just like daddy
If he ain't care, why should they?
For this 'High price' life, it's the price I pay
My life, do ya feel what I feel?
My life, a black girl's ordeal, my life
Do ya see what I see?
Have you been where I've been?
Can you go where I go?
My life
Do ya'll know what it feels like?
Do ya'll know what it be like?
Do ya see what I see?
Have you been where I've been?
Can you go where I go?
All my girls cross the world that feel what I feel
Hearts bruised, then been way I been, keep it movin'
Let him do his thing, I'm the one he's lovin'
I'm here to show ya'll, havin' a kid ain't meanin' nuthin'
That ain't keepin' him, specially if he in love with another chick
Then you stuck with the babymother shit
Don't be lovin' niggas more than yaself
Let 'em roam, a dog always finds his way home
Shit, ya'll don't wanna take my place, cashin' cases
Spit in faces, I never seem falsely accused
While some say it's rude
But if I was a dude, they all be amused
But I'm a woman, so I'm a bitch, simple as that
Double standards, call him a Mack, call me a hoe
Say I'm in it for the dough, but tell me
What tha fuck he in it for?
Wanted it all, now it's all mine
Loneliness, sorrow, confusion and pain
Nightmares, headlines, "Rapper found slain"
If it wasn't for my moms, I'd drown in this pain
Now ya'll see what it's like, ya'll don't wanna be me
'Cuz it ain't always what it seem on TV
Shit, but this is my nine to five ya'll
Sometimes I wanna slit my wrist and end my life ya'll
My life, do ya feel what I feel?
My life, a black girl's ordeal my life
Do ya see what I see?
Have you been where I've been?
Can you go where I go?
My life
Do ya'll know what it feels like?
Do ya'll know what it be like?
Do ya see what I see?
Have you been where I've been?
Can you go where I go?
