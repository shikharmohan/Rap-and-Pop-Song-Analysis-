Guess who's back?
Right about now its time for those notorious thugs
Bizzy, wish, Krayzie, Layzie
Flesh, and that nigga DJ U-Neek
Mo' thug takin' over so you best beware
'Cuz we came to shut this motherfuckea down
Ya, bone comin' back at you bitches for the 97
Ya, these mothafuckaz didn't think it was on
Old playa-hatin' ass niggaz ya my niggaz
Brung they style to the table 1st
Nigga, why don't you relize, reconize, idolize
It's over bitch, it's the art of war
Retaliation, retaliation, retaliation
Retaliation, retaliation, retaliation
Abort, when it's the art of war
The art of war, of war
Abort, when it's the art of war
The art of war, of war
Abort, when it's the art of war
The art of war, of war
Abort, when it's the art of war
The art of war, of war
Abort, when its' the art of war

Playa playa, we done party over time
See we done partied over time
Abort, when its' the art of war
1 and 2 world war
Playa playa, we done party over time
See we done partied over time
Guess, who's back?
