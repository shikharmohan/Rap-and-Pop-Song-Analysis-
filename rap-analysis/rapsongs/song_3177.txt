Nigga, the mission's to get what you don't got
The struggle, it don't stop until we drop
Krayzie Bone an' Ice Cube
The best thing in life is life
Get your mind right an' get your grind right
We gotta keep goin', hey, young thugs
We gotta keep goin'
Get your mind right an' get your grind right
Hey, young thugs
Get your mind right an' get your grind right
Look into my eyes if you wanna know me
Before you hypnotized, homey, what do you see?
A figure that's just a little bigger than dealers
A hustler countin' figures, ain't pulled no triggers
Can you dig us? We be the ultimate lick
We's the hitters that make the ultimate hits
Kinda flossy, kinda bossy
It's gotta be done my way, do what the, I say
Top of the pyramid, homey, what I tell you?
If you leave this West Side umbrella, you hit the cellar
Bring me my slippers, black robe an' my globe
An' I could rule the world with my eyes closed
See the mission's to get what we don't got
Until we filthy rich an' on top
You betta go get it, it's yours
Nigga, the mission's to get what you don't got
The struggle, it don't stop until we drop
Krazyie Bone an' Ice Cube
See the mission's to get what we don't got
Until we filthy rich an' on top
You betta go get it, it's yours
Nigga, the mission's to get what you don't got
The struggle, it don't stop until we drop
To all the little homies that's watchin' TV
I see you tryin' to be a O.G. like me
Chasin' dreams, pullin' mo' schemes for wealth
But the best thing in life is health, be yourself, playa
Television, it'll keep yo' ass wishin' forever
You'll never get your life together
Don't talk about death, I got too much life to live
Too many orders to give, what it is? Showbiz
Taught you what a trick an' a hoe is
Showed you what a '64 is
Lord knows, 'In God We Trust'
An' everybody in the world wanna be like us
See the mission's to get what we don't got
Until we filthy rich an' on top
You betta go get it, it's yours
Nigga, the mission's to get what you don't got
The struggle, it don't stop until we drop
Krazyie Bone an' Ice Cube
See the mission's to get what we don't got
Until we filthy rich an' on top
You betta go get it, it's yours
Nigga, the mission's to get what you don't got
The struggle, it don't stop until we drop
To the kids of the world that's waitin' for wealth
Waitin' for health, you better do for self
Homey, that's yo' last cup
Forget about the fast buck, boy, get yo' ass up
People use yo' brain to gain
Do somethin' that ain't never been done an' we can spend hun's
Wipe our ass with twenties, light our joints with ones
Throw away the guns, have nothin' but fun
An' homey, we could do that
Police have a fit, when yo' paper's legit
We gotta get off the phone, we gotta teach our own
Send yo' baby to school an' she'll come back grown
We got to talk to our grandmas
An' she'll help us through them dark halls an' them pitfalls
Everybody know we got the world to gain
We got to stop the pain, Lord stop the rain
See the mission's to get what we don't got
Until we filthy rich an' on top
You betta go get it, it's yours
Nigga, the mission's to get what you don't got
The struggle, it don't stop until we drop
Krazyie Bone an' Ice Cube
See the mission's to get what we don't got
Until we filthy rich an' on top
You betta go get it, it's yours
Nigga, the mission's to get what you don't got
The struggle, it don't stop until we drop
Keep goin', little homey, why you slowin'?
Keep rollin', little homey, why you slowin'?
Keep rollin', little homey, why you slowin'?
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
