Nigga we doin' this shit from Cleveland to L.A.
Nigga whatever you niggas want we bringing it
Thug Luv nigga what time is it?
I don't give a fuck where you lay at
It's time to slay these bitch made niggas
They ain't even knowing what type of niggas we is
Where my thugs at Bone Thugs-N-Harmony
I know you niggas been waiting for this shit for a long time
Well here it is nigga here it is what you gone do with it
Well I must be close to the Armageddon
Lord You know that I won't fly that lesson
You taught me to pull out my Wesson
You brought and am I stressing it softly
Get 'em up off me 'cause all we wanted
Was harmony been bombing 'em yell up outta my ghetto
I want settle get on my level
They can't stop me or drop me nigga they got me fuck naw
Little Pac get schizophrenic and manage to damage all y'all
I'll talk about 'em and you don't really want it
'Cause they're cornered and I want 'em to jump up
I'd rather say that we came to shut 'em all down
So quick to test bullet yes declare war
Roll and I'll blow when I get the gun for the murder
Mo' horror for what the did it all pause for the cause
And I fin to pull a nine or pistol little nigga
Wit mine fuck dem niggas it's on
All y'all fall Bizzy gettin' bitches test me bless the floor
In any attempt to arrest me stress me Lord
Looking at death with the last of my breath
Follow follow my kids but don't sin in my steps
Yet the weapon is kept with the best of my secrets
Deep in the leaves I'm alone nigga believe
That I can see it if needed an if you really want me in
Well let it be and get the greens and be runnnin' up over Cleveland
Ha ha ha what's poppin' nigga? Put your motherfucking
Hand on your strap nigga, we can do this like gangstas and slug it out
Or be like punks and punk it out
Pull your strap on me nigga and you better kill be thug life baby
I'll probably be punished for hard livin' blind to the facts
Thugs is convicts in Gods prison hand on the strap
Praying to Father please forgive me police be rushing when they see me
I flaunted America's most wanted live on TV life
Pleasure and pain stuck in this game holler my name
We all gone die we bleed through similar veins
You'se explain to me now don't panic when my gun burst
Heard the last jam nigga this ones worse
My nigga bone held the chrome till I came home
Thug Luv playas tell these bitch niggas bring it on
I caught a plane out to Cleveland late last evening
To help my niggas clean up some niggas no longer breathing now
Who you believe in hit the weed and breathe it's a
Cold ass the world them niggas kill you in your sleep
Until they stop me bury murder me or drop me
I got Thug Luv for my nationwide posse feel me
Little thug from the land nigga never ran
Motherfuckers out to get me they don't understand
It's the number 1 nigga out with a nation of niggas
Down to put in some work do some dirt
Fuckin' round with the band Bone Thugs-N-Harmony
Follow down the road we stroll to meet karma
Everything I do it seem to cause drama
Ready for the war like a knight in my armor bomb ya
So quick to test us nigga wanna crash me eat dust
For the love of the lust niggas bustin' on us
Hit 'em up with he buck 12 gauge erupt
It's the Art Of War putting niggas on the floor
When I'm comin' through the door
Bringin' nothin' but terror
Causing much to the nigga that dared us
Trying to put a twist in this thugsta era
Paired up with a nigga like Pac
And a nigga like me gotta stay high
Thug Luv till I die keep my prayer to the sky
But I'm still in the hood smoke and fry
So I beg the Lord to save us all escapers of misery
Bless my niggas in penitentiaries soldiers of the century
Here to get it told my niggas to get the hell down
Down with the dirt and we don't fuck around
Buck a couple of rounds and if you're passing
Through then hit the ground
And don't get caught up in the crossfire nigga
Artillery thick and you don't want to get to fuckin' with this
I'm straight devil devil not a punk and pretend
I reload buck a little more flee the scene
'Fore the po-po even know what you lookin' for
They don't know a motherfucker with a Leatherface hey
Man she said I ran this way said I ran that way
You hoes'll never know because I got away yeah
A criminal mind a nigga on the level sometimes
So get high and analyze your crime
Directly organized with results you'll be surprised
Oh nigga can you feel the vibe we can ride?
Playa hating niggas you gots to die
It's over wit Bone better leave it alone
Mo Thug I'm cracking' fuckin' domes
Still in the hood where the thugs play
Fuckin' wit nothin' but thugs man
Ain't taking no shorts or no losses
We crackin' them domes around my way
Give it to 'em on another level nigga
Get a shovel you can dig a hole bitches is dead
Infrared to the head you can beg
But still gone bleed bloody red
Fuck with mine will be see in the moonlight
'Cause we out ridin' looking for you
Better run for cover nigga duck we about to bust
Straight got the Infrared
Put it on his forehead make some moves
Send flowers straight to his home
Put a card in the motherfucker send it to his mama
Tell her he was dead wrong dead wrong gone now he long gone
