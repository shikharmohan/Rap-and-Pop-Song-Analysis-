Oh yes I love her like... 
Oh yes I love her like...egyptian 
Want a description? her body's sickenin 
I can be her prescription, I can be her physician 
Sexual healing, I can be her religion 
And now shes kneeling, praying to the ceiling 
I bless her as if she sneezed 
Must be the weather, I dress her, I am her sleeves 
I am her feathers, she's fly, 
Flyer than you, flyer than me, 
I love her, she loves me too 
I love her three..times more than her mom 
Time will tell that im the nigga 
That she should, we should 
Be wherever she wanna be 
On a late night, mid day, AM 
Just say when and I know I be with cavemen 
But never..mind them 
She's poison and I am Michael Bivins 
See I know y'all dont hear me 
But she does, we does 
What grown folk do when they had too much to drink 
And I think, we done had to much too drink and.. 
(Oh yes I love her like...) 
Pussy, Money, Weed, Pussy, Money, Weed, Pussy, Money, Weed (X's 4) 
Oh yes I love her like I ought too 
I see you at the alter mrs. carter 
I see you with my daughter 
Or son, more than one 
Maybe five like the jacksons 
Or john pacson 
Just dont let them fuck up the mansion 
And daddy will be home later on 
Smelling like the cologne 
That I put on this morn 
And I hope that you smell like woman soap 
And shampoo and lotion 
And perfume and candles 
And ima run thru that pussy like a vandal 
Yes im nasty as a Scorpio 
But ima lucky Libra 
Got her wet like she's sweating out a fever (wow) 
Leave her to me and she'll be smiling 
Every single time you see her 
From ear to ear 
I wanna be beside her when she sleep and she lay 
Or we can stay awake and watch the next day 
Clothes are overrated, panties are debated 
Einstein..her head is the greatest 
(Oh yes I love her like...) 
Pussy, Money, Weed, Pussy, Money, Weed, Pussy, Money, Weed 
Oh yes I love her like her dad told her 
No man would ever love her 
Oh and I better be the only man 
Sticking it, licking it like an envelope 
Mailing it, sealing it, read it 
I have written down victoria's secret 
Dont tell nobody, dont share your body 
With nobody, not even a finger 
I will cut it off and let him keep it 
That as for weezy, baby 
And at my station we have sex orientation 
When I hit it she squint like them orient asians 
I do me, I say hey miss chung lee 
I like to see your booty 
Roll like sushi, im tryin to dip my celery 
Up in her bleu cheese 
Ah's, oo wee's, wa la's, ta da's 
Mhm's, uh huh's, oh yeahs, never oh no's 
Until I have to go, and then its never oh no 
I tell her dont cry, I be back like the electric bill 
And when she butt naked she dress to kill! 
(Oh yes I love her like...) 
Pussy, Money, Weed, Pussy, Money, Weed, Pussy, Money, Weed 
Oh, oh yes I love her like...
