Aye, you niggas ain't raw
I don't buy none of that bullshit you tellin' me
King you'll never be
I can see you niggas ain't raw
Hell, no, give a damn who you go and get
Real niggas know it
We can notice that you niggas ain't raw
Even though that you suppose to be down with so and so
You still the same lame from a year ago
I know you ain't raw
You ain't graduated with the gladiators
You're just practice for the young assassinators
Aye, you know you ain't raw
Fuck the shit you tellin' them, I know he ain't [Incomprehensible]
He ain't no competitor, that shit there ain't scarin' us
You bought yourself a slaughterer and a coffin's what you headed for
You didn't wanna die, well, nigga, what you pull a weapon for?
Jackin', we the niggas all ya'll ho bitches checkin' for
And ain't nobody real niggas would rather hear instead of
You don't know how to shine it up, bein that I sell it up
Lot of niggas do it, don't nobody do as well as us
Hater wanna [Incomprehensible] with us, let him get to vestin' up
Hit 'em with the chopper, chest and up, bet I wet ya up
Let ya partner get ya up, ain't nobody catchin' up
But this some shit, I'm dyin' to receive a lethal injection for
King of the whole thing, fuck whoever stepping up
Give a damn who left behind or care about who catchin' up
Long as I'm alive the second best you'll have to settle for
Come on now, you really think you better bro?
Aye, you niggas ain't raw
I don't buy none of that bullshit you tellin' me
King you'll never be
I can see you niggas ain't raw
Hell, no, give a damn who you go and get
Real niggas know it
We can notice that you niggas ain't raw
Even though that you suppose to be down with so and so
You still the same lame from a year ago
I know you ain't raw
You ain't graduated with the gladiators
You're just practice for the young assassinators
Aye, you know you ain't raw
I got both friends blowin' on a boat just goin'
This bitch, his bitch, and your bitch blowin'
Young pimpin', get dough in like his last name Conin
My fan base spread and the shit kept growin'
Now I got me getting head in the vessel of the G4 again
Hook a hustle up with investors and there he go again
Twenty million later I'm guessin' it's finally soakin' in
At best you just a hater who mad at me 'cuz he broke again
Sellin' all ya jewelry, considerin' of sellin' dope again
'Cuz he who's ballin' outta control, is supposed to be focusin'
Wanna be the king by default, they hopin' for openings
Pray they see the day they hear me say I'll never flow again
But, oh contraire  I guarantee in one year
After another they'll suffer as long as I'm here
Fear no man alive, I don't care
You don't run shit, nigga, be clear
Aye, you niggas ain't raw
I don't buy none of that bullshit you tellin' me
King you'll never be
I can see you niggas ain't raw
Hell, no, give a damn who you go and get
Real niggas know it
We can notice that you niggas ain't raw
Even though that you suppose to be down with so and so
You still the same lame from a year ago
I know you ain't raw
You ain't graduated with the gladiators
You're just practice for the young assassinators
Aye, you know you ain't raw
Aye, you niggas ain't raw
