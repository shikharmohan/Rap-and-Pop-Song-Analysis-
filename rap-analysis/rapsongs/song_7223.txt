Don't hate me shawty
But even if you hate me shawty
I still love you
And now I only wish that you could
See that my intentions were good
I still love you
Don't hate me shawty
But even if you hate me shawty
I still love you
And now I only wish that you could
See that my intentions were good
I still love you
Forgave me once, forgave me twice, forgave me three times
I stayed lyin', you stayed down in the meantime
Had my son and turned around and had another one
I broke yo heart when I told you bout the other one
I stay in trouble ha? Ain't got too much to lose
Knew I could lose it all but never thought of losin' you
Eleven years ago I still regret me choosin' you
Meetin' you, pursuin' you and doin' you in '92
You fixed plates, showed yo face at every courtdate
And all you wanted me to do was call when I was out late
How could I let you go? I thought I knew it all
When you deserved the best and more, you been through it all
So you think I sold yo dreams, but what I say I mean
Just take it to consideration, I was 17
I'm still the same man, just had a change of plan
Never ask you back and fuck a wedding band but I still love you
Don't hate me shawty
But even if you hate me shawty
I still love you
And now I only wish that you could
See that my intentions were good
I still love you
Don't hate me shawty
But even if you hate me shawty
Hey, I still love you
And now I only wish that you could
See that my intentions were good
I still love you
Went from resentin' you, hatin' you, now I'm missin' you
On the realest shit I ever dropped, listen pops
I never even thought, to ask my mom what happened
Just knew that you was livin' in Manhattan and I was trappin'
We never had a chance, we was in different states
But I'll forgive it, you was human and we make mistakes
You tried to make it up, but shit, you couldn't pay enough
You sent me tons of toys and clothes thinkin' you gave enough
But it wasn't though, and you wasn't there
That's all I knew, so I grew up thinkin' you ain't care
I know it wasn't fair, but ay, it wasn't fun
But now what's done is done, no matter wha, I'm still yo son
I could care less if none of yo other children come
I'ma be right there prayin' you live to be a million one
Finally I understand, hustlin', livin' fast
Tryin' to get the cash and settle down and be a dad
You probably never knew, 'cuz hey, I never said it
But pops, I'm just like you, I'm stubborn and I'm hardheaded
But now you dead in the ground, no meanin' tellin' you now
But all I wanted was for you to be proud and I still love you
Don't hate me shawty
If I ain't told you lately shawty
I still love you
Now, I only wish that I could
See that yo intentions were good
I still love you
Don't hate me shawty
Please don't hate me shawty
Ay, I still love you
And now I only wish that I could
See that yo intentions were good
And I still love you
How could I criticize my daddy on that last verse?
Lookin' at my own dirt, you got some nerve
But be that as it may, I got some shit to say
It's been a secret, I can't keep it for another day
I got a lil' girl, not just two lil' boys
And that's been killin' me inside, eatin' me alive
And I can't find the words, nor the nouns or verbs
To express whachu deserve, girl you worth the world
But I'm a man and I ain't perfect, if you hear me now
I'll tell you wha had happened, when, why, where, how
Me and yo mama met, we kinda kicked it off
But we wasn't 'posed to have a baby, we just chillin' out
We had a lot in common, almost the same sign
Same goals, said thangs at the same time
But then we destroyed the situation like a changed mind
How could I look her in her eyes and holla dat ain't mine
Her stomach gettin' bigger, and time is gettin' close
Six, seven, eight, nine months and I ain't told mah folks
Not just Messiah mama, hell, I had told yo granny
Three kids in two years, baby, daddy had it
But I ain't ashamed of you, I'm more ashamed of me
It's not at all yo fault, you'd be better off blamin' me
But now I realize, where the problem lies
Forgive me babygirl, I apologize and I still love you
Don't hate me shawty
Please, don't hate me, shawty
'Cuz I still love you
Now I only wish that you could
See that my intentions were good
Baby, I still love you
Don't hate me, shawty
Please, don't hate me, Shawty
Hey, I still love you
Now I only wish that you could
See that my intentions were good
Baby, I still love you
I'm done with you
