Uh, uh, uh, huh, yo, yo
Drop your glasses, shake your asses
Face screwed up like you having hot flashes
Which one, pick one, this one, classic
Red from blond, yeah bitch, I'm drastic
Why this? Why that? Lips stop asking
Listen to me baby, relax and start passing
Expressway, hair back, weaving through the traffic
This one strong should be labeled as a hazard
Some of y'all niggas hot, sike I'm gassing
Clowns, I spot 'em and I can't stop laughing
Easy come, easy go, E V gon' be lasting
Jealousy, let it go, results could be tragic
Some of y'all ain't writing well, too concerned with fashion
None of you ain't gizell, cat walk and imagine
A lotta y'all Hollywood, drama, passed it
Cut bitch, camera off, real shit, blast it
And if I had to give you up, it's only been a year
Now, I got my foot through the door and I ain't going nowhere
It took awhile to get me in and I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear, now, let me blow your mind
They wanna bank up, crank up, makes me dizzy
Shank up, haters wanna come after me
You ain't a gangster, prankster, too much to eat
Snakes in my path wanna smile up at me
Now, while you gritting your teeth
Frustration baby, you gotta breathe
Take a lot more that you to get rid of me
You see I do what they can't do, I just do me
Ain't no stress when it comes to stage, get what you see
Meet me in the lab, pen and pad, don't believe
Huh, sixteens mine, create my own lines
Love for my wordplay that's hard to find
Sophomore, I ain't scared, one of a kind
All I do is contemplate ways to make your fans mine
Eyes bloodshot, stressing, chills up your spine
Huh, sick to your stomach wishing I wrote your lines
And if I had to give you up, it's only been a year
Now, I got my foot through the door and I ain't going nowhere
It took awhile to get me in and I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear, now, let me blow your mind
Let your bones crack, your back pop, I can't stop
Excitement, glock shots from your stash box
Fuck it, thugged out, I respect the cash route
Locked down, blasting, sets while I mash out
Yeah nigga, mash out, D R E
Back track, think back, E V E
Do you like that? You got to I know you
Had you in a trance first glance from the floor too
Don't believe I'll show you, take you with me
Turn you on, pension gone, give you relief
Put your trust in a bomb when you listen to me
Damn she much thinner know now I'm complete
Still stallion, brick house, pile it on
Ryde or Die, bitch, double R, can't crawl
Beware, 'cause I crush anything I land on
Me here, ain't no mistake nigga it was planned on
And if I had to give you up, it's only been a year
Now, I got my foot through the door and I ain't going nowhere
It took awhile to get me in and I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear, now, let me blow your mind
