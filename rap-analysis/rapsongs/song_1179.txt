(Intro: Barron Ricks)
That's right nigga, dynamic duo style, what?
Green horn in a cadle style motherfucker
(Barron Ricks)
Oh shit, my styles' progress like hot sex upon a firm matress
But limit the techniques to get freak
Now look at me, Cavarsay, Cognac, VS'll be puffin' the don-deago
Macanoodle, out armadayo
(B-Real)
Yayo, up, ready to sell and bail, we niggas afrail
(Post-dated, put 'em in the mail nigga)
I'm the hill figure, deliver your body to the river (uh)
How you feelin' (how you), how you livin' (how you), how you breathin'
(Barron Ricks)
Fuck it, whatever's clever, fort and sex and def or real I got your back
Which ever Squadron you attack yo I attack
I got my automated Mossberg, hand on the pump
ready to dump, so yo we gettin' dum-de-de-dum-dum-dum
(B-Real)
Dum-de-de-dum, when they hearin' the gats hum like a siren
Niggas they be, barkin' and whilin'
Thuggin' in stylin', holdin' the dope smilin'
Yo, smooth, what you pilin' up, go make a move
(Barron Ricks)
Yo, path for Central Harlem where niggas be sparkin' son I beg your pardon
Ese rollin', if you got it, pass it to the margin
If you want it greedy, come and get it
Aiyyo, we got it, Cypress, Cannibus Seeteeva, fuckin' freak of shit
(B-Real)
Motherfuckers refuse to loose my whole crew, don't get it confused
Don't light a fuse or get bruised
Like a gat I'll have to bust your ass or feel the blast of the shot glass
full of jack and smokin' hash
(Chorus: B-Real)
(So can you handle this) They can't fuckin' handle this
(So can you handle this) It be that Cypress Hill shit
(So can you handle this) They can't fuckin' handle this
(So can you handle this) Handle this, y'all can't fuck with this
(B-Real)
Back up in the mills of the Cypress Hill
You catchin' a thrill, coppin' a feel, the whole steel
Everybody put their blunts up in the sky
Cause everybody's sparkin' the dutches and gettin' high
(Barron Ricks)
At 1-5-5, the city bread it, exit, got that method
Yo, what y'all infected, we crashin' fords ain't no substitutions
Me and B-Real want all our restitution's
that means our back pays so niggas pay up
Now, what the FUCK!!
(B-Real)
I'm an addict, addicted to static and bad habits
Bringin' the magic, opposite the Nina Milli Automatic
War is war, a battles' a battle, the gat'll be your friend
It'll be your end, it'll be your shadow
(Barron Ricks)
Now y'all shadowboxinists, irrational, rap new recruitin'
dirty denim, timb boots, hummin', gunnin' for his competition
Listen yo, we all be on that trivial don't change shit
lame shit, Cypress is all about the Mary Jane shit
(B-Real)
No competition can handle the whole mission
Bitches are wishin' me on but they won't last long
Family ties are fly, do you do or die
You try to escape, all the visions up in your mind
(Chorus: B-Real)
(So can you handle this) They can't fuckin' handle this
(So can you handle this) It be that Cypress Hill shit
(So can you handle this) They can't fuckin' handle this
(So can you handle this) Handle this, y'all can't fuck with this
