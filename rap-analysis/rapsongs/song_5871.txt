Ohh yeah
Naughty By Nature in the house, stompin', word 'em up
You got mack daddy right here in the middle
Got the baby faced, one little G in the house
Yeah, this is Vin Rock in the place, Kaygee layin' back wit his feet up
Yeah, yo okay, it's been a long and tedious road, man
Takin' care of all this record business, yo, word 'em up
A lot of sleepin' a whole bunch of sleepin', yo, by the way
We got some Naughty By Nature pajamas and pillows comin' out
For everybody who slept around the way on the projects
Hear what 'em sayin', V? Word 'em up
Bring your motherfuckin' ass on up, word 'em up word up
Know what I'm sayin', Mark? 45 kis
I got more damn time than I got money, honey
So if you're a gold digger, nigga please, that joke was funny
And for that diss comin' from you in particular, shoot
You better kill it, for a scab that isn't no ways nears cute
You say I diss you hard after I did you fine, it ain't my fault
It's just your face that's mighty different in the daytime
See I'm the type to meet a girl and call her bluff
They say I'll keep you if you're sweeter than my other stuff
Not like a pimp or like a pope, 'cos I know who's to wail
They watch the clock, then rock and do your crew while you're in jail
Well I'm a little bit of or should I say a lot past that
So take your saggy boob and bib rap to some other cat
Gimme this and gimme that, I give that ass a smack
You wanna get a richer life, you better get a mack
So he can work ya like the trick you really are, ya stunt
I'm hittin' the back door when I come 'cos you're a fuckin' front
You disappointed me, I had many plans in store
I didn't know that I was in for, a project whore or
A money-grabbin' dragon wit no future plans
Pickin' a newer coat or car, you need a newer man
'Cos I ain't livin' to be givin' out what I done save
You wanna live in a condo, better find a cave
If we went half on the rent or if ya had a job
Then I could think about it before I say oh naw
Hell, no is all I think about when I see you
Damn real is how I feel when I be comin' through
Wit what is what you ask, I come through in the end
How's that? 'Cos when I drop one, I call her friends
Bravo, damn real, oh yes is what comes next
You gotta get up mighty early to twirl the Treach
I diss you, you'll be strugglin' and you say I want you, sir
If ya front, if ya stunt, I might want her
Word 'em up, damn, he just rip that shit
Ooh, can I get? Hold your breath, will you die? Not the Treach
I want those, never that, gimme this, put it back
But you smooth, very nice, ain't it def? Not that bright
Check you shoes so, there's two, down on sound, so are you
Yes indeedy, I get greedy when it comes to dough
'Cos then I'm eedy with the heebie-jeebies when I'm broke
And I don't so don't wanna roll a brother any long
So I just try and on and on over time alone
Yeah, I spend in twos infuse, baby, you won't last
You'll be runnin' so fast, your feet'll be kickin' your own ass
Your every ride is somethin' makes you just say
'Cos she drivin' his car more than he does any room
Ya call me dual lock, it is true, I say now hey hey there
Call us some black shit, pop a click, I say you're halfway there
If ya wanna movie or dinner, I say oh, here
You wanna trip or a cruise, ya bitch, I mean, no dear
You'll be alright though, you'll find the right bro
Hell have the right ho, then y'all a go broke
But anyway, for any day, I'm dissin' any trick
That's tryin' to flick my bit 'cos I ain't havin' it
Word 'em up, damn, he just rip that shit
