Uh,
And that's the story, no life no more, just loss 
Caught up in between the negative and positive force,
Carmen Brown, sad tale of a life cut short, who 
Take the responsibility when the guns go off, on one 
Side you have Hill, he gotta live with the guilt.
Is he the one that she needed, or the one that got her killed?
Or is it Carmen to blame for her own damn fault?  Did she
Play with his heart, and never loved him at all?  It doesn't
Matter now because she restin' in peace, and all the playas in the
Game will have ta live with the grief.  It's only now that she's
Gone you will truly discover the immortal love of Carmen Brown
There will never be another.
