Talk is cheap motherf*****!!!!
What's on y'all n***** minds
F*****' wit me, y'all know somebody has
Told you about f*****' wit D
Stuck in a tree is what you will be
Like a cat and I'm the dog at the bottom
Lookin' up now what's that
Your worst nightmare is I take it right there
You got n***** comin', where they at right where?
I make 'em like air, floatin' away, wouldn't 
Tell what he was thinkin' so i opened a way
Went from broken away, you know he hurt before he died
Only two knew the answer and one of us is dead
So anyone who seeks the truth can get it straight to the head
Then you and him can discuss what I did
Yeah it was wrong dog but I slid
I'll repent one day just not right now
You hear my s*** all on the street 
I'm kinda hot right now
[CHORUS] I don't give a f*** about
Y'all n***** cause y'all ain't killin' nuttin'
[Repeat CHORUS]
I wanna break bread with the cats
That I starve with, wanna hit the malls
With the same dogs I rob wit
Wanna be able to laugh with the n*****
That I cried with, when it's over be like
These is the n***** that I died wit
What do you do when you find out
In the hall there's a rat
What do you do when you find out
That your dog is a cat
S***, on n*****'s back, can't hold but two
So while you gettin' more gats I'm puttin' holes
In you, snubnose will do, break 'em off real
Proppa', need to keep it spittin' but I ain't gonna
Stoppa, cocka, unlocka, let 'em go
Give it to his man just to let him know
All things considered it was real for a minute 
Got what was yours and tried to steal somethin' wit it
Now feel somethin' hit it, your chest that is
The best that is, probably the best that slid
Yo stress that kid
[CHORUS] [x2]
When n***** hear that dog bark
They betta run,when police hear
That dog bark they betta come
They expect the same thing that's live
And their lives will be lost
There is a price to pay
How many lives will be lost, c'mon
Since I run with the d****
I'm one with the d****
I stay doin' dirt so I'm gonna come with the shovel
Hit you on a level of a madman whose mind's twisted
Made n***** dreams caught 
The last train, mine's missed it
Listed as a maniac depressin' with extreme paranoia
And dog I got somethin' for ya
Hear my name, feel my pain
N***** wanna steal my fame
But first feel my reign
Know what it's like to suffer
Never have enough of s***
Startin' off hard than only gettin' rougher
Tougher, but then came the grease
So if you wanna say peace, tame the beast
