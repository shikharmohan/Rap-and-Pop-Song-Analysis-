Black folks can't never have no fun
These streets be crazy
  (Walkin' down the avenue)
  (From Hollywood to South Central)
These streets be crazy
(Long Beach to Compton)
Always up to no good
  (Crazy)
Crazy, crazy
Always up to no good
(Venice to Santa Ana, crazy)
Crazy
Have a look outside, take a stroll with me
California lifestyle, you wanna roll with me
I can take you in and out and where it's gonna be
And now it's crazy as it is, you know this home for me
I would never leave it, you know that's wrong to me
I'ma gonna stay down, ya see, we doin' the corners, G
At your local liquor store, gettin' some optimals
And if I'm out of bounce, then I got to ***
Keep it on the low, on the W-W-West Coast
Sign some autographs and then I do get ghost
Hehe, yeah, I love my folks
But half of y'all fools is cut first
On a real note, the streets that have you
Guide you, lead you, mislead you, it's fragile
Yeah, see, you gradually grow
And when you walkin' on my side, I think you all need to know
These streets be crazy
  (Walkin' down the avenue)
  (From Hollywood to South Central)
These streets be crazy
(Long Beach to Compton)
Always up to no good
(Crazy)
Crazy, crazy
Always up to no good
(Venice to Santa Ana, crazy)
Crazy
On the 110 Freeway floatin' back to the block
In a 7 deuce Coupe hoppin'-hippin' da hop
Sippin' on some Henn with my nephew Infra Red
Young pimp on the grind, tryin' to line up some ***
Have fun, deal done, on the west, we won
Don't matter where you're from, if you're old or young
Seesaw, we walk like ooh-la-la
*** the law, we don't caught, we *** do da da
Yeah, ***, we shakin' the cops
You *** out there just be makin' it hot
But don't trip, if you fakin' a lot
I'll break you, shake you and take your spot
'Cause if you think that you gon' slip through California
Without gettin' banged on, brother, you wrong
(Always up to no good)
I really love my dog, grew up together and all but he's
  (Always up to no good)
Hell yeah, I love New York
That's why I married the broad but she
  (Always up to no good)
We can't hang no more 'cause I'm a baller y'all and he's
  (Always up to no good)
Let me tell you about these streets, yeah
  (Always up to no good)
These streets be crazy
  (Walkin' down the avenue)
  (Always up to no good)
(From Hollywood to South Central)
  (Always up to no good)
These streets be crazy
    (Always up to no good)
(Long Beach to Compton)
Always up to no good
   (Crazy)
Always up to no good, crazy

Always up to no good
(Venice to Santa Ana, crazy)
Always up to no good
