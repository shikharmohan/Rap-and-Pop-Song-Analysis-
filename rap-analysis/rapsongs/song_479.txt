-Intro-AK- 
Let's go get 'em. 
-Chorus-AK- 
I don't stop, I run the red lights, my enemies are so strife
I ask God to guard my life, guard my life, guard my life
I don't stop, I run the red lights, my enemies are so strife
I ask God to guard my life, guard my life, guard my life

[VERSE 2] 
Layzie Bone 
(Buck, buck, buck...) 
What'd you expect? I'm in the fast lane
ever since the cash came
I'm a slow down, I'm a mash on
My passion is about game
I got thangs, but I want more
Flow Mo' till I get dough
What they hittin' for? I'm a pistol
You playa haters better get low
I got issues and I tend to 'em, handle thangs like men do 'em
Bout the money man, I be influenced
Damn right, I be into it
Ball all of the time, that's how I feel
I gotta get mines, that's how I live
You want to be thugs? Know this' for real, careful dog, you could be killed
I'm still in the field; real
Nigga, I choose to be
It chose me, I ain't choose the streets
I breaks 'em off usually
Broody like Illuminati, fast life like I live a party
I ain't tryin' to hurt nobody, I don't need no of ya'll to spot me
Lil' Lay gon' keep it Godly, give it up to my Heavenly Father
If you ain't bout it, bout that, then I don't wanna be bothered
We keep it pimpin' harder, now, ya'll don't want no problems
I'm prayin' for you, you prayin' for me; We can get these dollars 
-Chorus-AK- 
I don't stop, I run the red lights,
my enemies are so strife
I ask God to guard my life, guard my life, guard my life
I don't stop, I run the red lights, my enemies are so strife
I ask God to guard my life, guard my life, guard my life
