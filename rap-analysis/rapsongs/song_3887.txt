Good evening ladies and gentlemen
I am the one and only Queen Bee
After me there will be none
But you could call me Miss White
Most people know me as Lil' Kim
The head of the La Bella Mafia
Oh, shout out to my girl Victoria Gotti
And the whole Gotti family stay up
This time around I ain't takin' no shit
This time around I never get bit
This time around I switched up my flow
Got rid of the pits and put rots by the do'
This time around it ain't like befo'
This time around I'm gon' crack ya jo'
The feds is watchin' me so I can't do much
Speak the wrong words bitch and you will get touched
I'm back on the scene my favorite color is green
I'm buildin' a empire, got a whole new team
Pimp game is strong, raps is just harder than
They ever been, you can never win
Made my way through Hollywood, fashion world adores me
Music's my first love, but nine to five bores me
Love me or hate me Lil' Kim come through
My fans across the world I came back for you
I came back for you
All incarcerated scarfaces gangstas with the fed cases
I came back for you
All my fans across the world holla at your girl
I came back for you
Everybody's waitin' on me all these hoes hatin' on me
I came back for you
The mink rockin' Benz coppin' keep the bottles poppin'
It's the real hip hop mami check the facts
I'm sick of all you acts with your bubble gum raps
Like the sand in the hour glass you out of your time
Tried to go against the queen is you out of your mind?
Even be at number two, your chances is slim
'Cause when God made Adam, he should've made Kim
I gave a few passes but I never forget
It's enough, I got to put up with this Doo Doo Brown chick
Now you and you wanna come at me from all sides
I'm gettin' money, don't think I just be lettin' shit slide
I'm very concerned with fashion ain't my fault y'all don't know how ta
Rock this Hollywood thang y'all need to let me style ya
Come back, to the light ma, I started the shit
How soon we forget I'm the heart of the shit
So keep your tacky ways and go back to your stripper days
As long as I'm around, you gon' bow down
I came back for you
All incarcerated scarfaces gangstas with the fed cases
I came back for you
All my fans across the world holla at your girl
I came back for you
Everybody's waitin' on me all these hoes hatin' on me
I came back for you
The mink rockin' Benz coppin' keep the bottles poppin'
This time around either your in or your out
This time around you better watch your mouth
This time around you gon' hang or bang
This time around you better do your thang
'Cause I'm the best that ever done it, the best that lived it
I ain't no overnight success goddamn it I was born with it
The Prada mama, the Dolce 'n' Gabbana drippin'
The Blue Hypnotic Martini Mimosa sippin'
Y'all better team or get it together
Or you, you and her, can get it whenever
Huh, I got a army y'all can't harm me
If the shoe was on the other foot you probably try to starve me
Don't get your life token I know I got you shooken
This Bed Stuff fly girl came back for Brooklyn
