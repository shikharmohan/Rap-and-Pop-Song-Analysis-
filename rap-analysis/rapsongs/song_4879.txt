Hello? What's up?
What's up, baby?
I need you right now
What you doin'?
I'm all alone in my room, layin' on my bed sheets
Come undress me, I'm feelin' so sexy
(Huh, you feelin' so sexy?)
I'm feelin' so sexy
Come undress me, I'm feelin' so sexy
My body's so tight and I'm needin' you to stretch me
Come undress me, I'm feelin' so sexy
(You feelin' so sexy?)
I'm feelin' so sexy
Come undress me, I'm feelin' so sexy
Well, I'm way over on the south side cruisin' in the 'Lac
But I'mma make it to your crib in 'bout four minutes flat
Keep talkin' how you talkin', baby, what you got on?
I got a black lace bra, leather boots and a thong
Well, I'll be there in the double
Expect when I step through the door
That it's 'bout to be some motherfuckin' trouble
Ohh, what you gonna do?
Sweat you out til' you thirsty
Pin your body to the ground and have you beggin' for mercy
Ooh, baby, wait a minute, you in my head
If I'm woke over from dreamin', I'd see you in my bed
'Til you makin' me, uh, and you makin' me, yeah
Now hurry up and make it to me 'cause you makin' me wait
I'm drivin' fast as I can, baby, hold it together
'Cause when I get you in my arms, I'mma hold you forever
Get you wet as Niagara falls, a rebel with a cause
I'll be breakin' down the doors so tell me where you are
I'm all alone in my room, layin' on my bed sheets
Come undress me, I'm feelin' so sexy
(Huh, you feelin' so sexy?)
I'm feelin' so sexy
Come undress me, I'm feelin' so sexy
My body's so tight and I'm needin' you to stretch me
Come undress me, I'm feelin' so sexy
(You feelin' so sexy?)
I'm feelin' so sexy
Come undress me, I'm feelin' so sexy
Hey, you got me eager as a beaver
See this the type shit get you the keys to the beamer
Or some cheese if you need it 'cause you got that good, good
You love it how I beat it like you stole it
When you throw it 'cause we keep it hood, hood
And I wish you would, would be my slave for the night
We can turn the bed room into my cave for the night
I'll be your favorite delight and make me call you 'Daddy'
While I'm takin' the pipe, you makin' me bite
I think you push it too deep, I need that type of lovin'
That'll put you to sleep, I wish you could see
Well, I can see it if you want me to, we can get the camera
We can role-play, you the artist, I'll be ya manager
You can be the nurse, I'm the doc
(Doc feel me in)
Play cops and robbers, or cowboy and Indians
In the end, let's say you won't know what hit cha'
Now I'm pullin' in the drive-way and comin' to get cha'
I'm all alone in my room, layin' on my bed sheets
Come undress me, I'm feelin' so sexy
(Huh, you feelin' so sexy?)
I'm feelin' so sexy
Come undress me, I'm feelin' so sexy
My body's so tight and I'm needin' you to stretch me
Come undress me, I'm feelin' so sexy
(You feelin' so sexy?)
I'm feelin' so sexy
Come undress me, I'm feelin' so sexy
Hey, baby
What's up?
Took you long enough
Yeah, I'mma make it worth the wait though, lay down
Yeah, mmm, hmm
Ohh, yeah
