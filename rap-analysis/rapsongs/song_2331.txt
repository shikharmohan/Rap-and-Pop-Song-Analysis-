Only if you want it, yes I really want it
Only if you want it, yes I really want it
Only if you want it, yes I really want it
Only if you want it, yes I really want it
Can I get an eye open up, Eazy locin' up, smokin' up, much dust
Like a nut what give it up for the real stuff, shut the what up
Back the shut up what, hustler from the hood hoe, hopin'
And mud rub, the finishin' touches
Would sure went rubbers
Comin' in bunches could serve like lunches
Hold ya horses here's where the source is not very tall but never took
A short kid with a clip to claw wouldn't draw Mcgraw
I trick a law before all and all I'm raw a naughty shorty
Sporty with a forty, a laddy takin' tours just to plan an orgy
A nasty critter, any hoe hitter, hated my babysitter
'Cause she wouldn't let me hit her, now get up on it
On and on get on it and I will pump it, only if you want it
Only if you want it, yes I really want it
Only if you want it, yes I really want it
Only if you want it, yes I really want it
Only if you want it, yes I really want it
Here's something from the ding dong ''cause I really care how long
Ya been strong grown, here comes the switch dome chrome
Couldn't hang with the king, out the rudder but I call for a yes y'all toots
My style is just as fresh as a Dusch bush, I face ya fact throw a heck
Just like Woody Wooder and if I left that means I should of booger
Here's a new track, for all the new jacks, I'm kickin' it the hardest
So gimmie my shoes back so I live when I step it's the pimp
And I rep so make a right and get left quick, so try to play strong and
Long gone, the flow is kinda funky but far from Armstrong, get up on it
On and on get on it and I will pump it, only if you want it
Only if you want it, yes I really want it
Only if you want it, yes I really want it
Only if you want it, yes I really want it
Only if you want it, yes I really want it
Ooh a new jack, a new jack
Kid I swear I saw a puddy cat, back, back smack
Here comes a witty black endin' in a skull high I'm 'bout to show why
Eazy's fillin' caps 'cause my gat's in the low ride bang when the gat
Sneaks two in the back seat, my homie rides shotgun waitin' to spotone
Duh is a fool who don't ride to slide to a ride, I'm shudder shakin'
The place when I start hey so don't butter, Eazy E but a park hey
The only thing to flow these now to be fly is a feather, I see the smilin'
Faces of while they sick, ya know me better, hard Rodney kid gettin'
Cali kid now ya know it boy left up in the alley dead, now get up on it
On and on get on it and I will pump it, only if you want it
Only if you want it, yes I really want it
Only if you want it, yes I really want it
Only if you want it, yes I really want it
Only if you want it, yes I really want it
