I87 is a lesson for them niggaz
That want to test
Bring more than 'cause me shotgun
Will be buckin' your chest
Wanna be mo' thug thugsta mentality
Runs through the bone
Pop pop to the dome
Fall short to the chrome
Get wrapped that bitches on
Much love for the green leaves
But me trues have to ease me down
Puff puff head rush
Popin' in me clip and I got plenty rounds
Me no pretenda
No studio thugsta
Bone'll get wit' cha
Straight number 1 lil' rispsta
Swing watch him hit cha
So we can swang
(We can swang)
Down for my thang
(Down for my thang)
Finna blow to tha brain
Though you could hang
When I swang them things
Thats insane
Stay low
(So low)
Dem popo know me no surrender
Dem niggaz on tha street they remember as beeing no pretenda
Standin up on tha block, 9 mm cocked
And me hang, and me got my niggaz lookin' out for me back
And them watch for them rocks
And you know its nuthin' but the neighborhood thang
It's mandatory for me neighborhood slang
