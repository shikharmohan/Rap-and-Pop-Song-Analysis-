There was once a dreamer named Peter
{What else happened}
Peter was also known as Skeeter
{What else happened}
Peter had sex with Anita
{What else happened}
Anita got pregnant from Peter
{What else happened}
Peter wasn't just with Anita
{What else happened}
Peter knew this girl named Rita
{What else happened}
Peter had sex with Rita
{What else happened}
Rita got pregnant from Peter
{What else happened}
Now two girls are pregnant by Peter
{What else happened}
But Rita doesn't know of Anita
{What else happened}
And Anita doesn't know Rita
{What else happened}
The two of them only know Peter
{What else happened}
Now Peter's at the mall with Anita
{What else happened}
You know he runs into Rita
{What else happened}
Well Rita takes a look at Anita
{What else happened}
And Anita takes a good look at Rita
{What else happened}
Well Rita starts to pull out the heater
{What else happened}
The heater now is pointed at Peter
{What else happened}
Anita jumps right on Rita
{What else happened}
Rita busts shots at Anita
{What else happened}
Rita missed Anita by meters
{What else happened}
But Rita's bustin' shots at Peter
{What else happened}
Just then somebody shook Peter
{What else happened}
Yo how many spoons of the dairy creamer
{What else happened}
It's Keisha sayin' wake up Peter
{What else happened}
That's why they call you the dreamer
{Now that's happenin'}
