How'd you like if I dressed you up in platinum?
Diamond rings, boo, you can have dem

Wanna break it down, get the Remy for that

You really wanna floss, get the Benz for that
With the rims for that, how sex is that

Got plans again, stack grands again
Make you wanna wave yo' hands again
Shake yo' waist again, who you crushin' then

Used to call me fatty, now they call me Big Daddy
Nigga get down like dat, nigga been around like dat
Better not bother, the big brother, in the Godfather hat
Screw dat, y'all better face it, y'all see the bracelet

Nigga, state yo' biz, handle yo' biz

Sip Bailey's in the Bentleys, agua, in the Jaguar

Heinekens with a dimepiece friend
All the, ladies in love with D

'Cause my niggaz on the block, can't forget dem
My mans on lock, can't forget dem

Heavy gon' coast through, like I'm supposed to
