Well it's the first of the month my nigga so you know what it is
Let's get down to the block and get that handlin' this biz
Call the dealers and killers, cut-throated thugs are gorillas
Got my haters to feel us and recognize who the trillest
I got my mind on my paper it's time for collectin'
My issue you neglectin', seem to me you disrespectin'
Boy don't play with my pape's 'cause I'ma gon' spray where you stay
Pull out that K in a day and get done away like you fake
Straight out PA short Texas, servin' trees on the West
A money makin' machine, nigga I do it best
With the cream and the cash, by any means I'ma mash
So go get my green out the stash, walk with that beam in ya ass

She on her knees in the low, I make 'em get down on the flo'
Flo', you niggaz say you want a better price
Price, you got it but it ain't gon' hook right
Drop seven on lock tight, fuck wit' it the whole night
Try to hit and she hid the Sprite, got you mad like Tina and Ike
Ike, my product always cover up good
Good, nigga I can put that on my neighborhood
Hold Arthur right on the water, white powder and hella snorter
Nigga wanna buy eight I brought 'em
Slowly off and then I ate in the squadda
Uh, now nigga look at how the time change
Change, check out the Jordan's on this wide frame

Besides that, nigga current or make five cents
It's seven, eight or nine, seventh time a month supply that
By fifty thousand, no more browsin', bitch I'm buyin' that
I'm ridin 'Llac with three old Benzes right behind that
Fifth comin' down we be flexin', fives and sixes in GTS's
Chrome tips with VVS's, neck and chest in VVS's
Oh yes it's, the mob better get your mind right
Ay Tip ain't goin' home, that don't even sound right
You niggaz actin' like a broad, I don't wanna fight
Nah I ain't gon' squab but I will have a gun fight
We finna hit the streets with the glock
With the G's in the block
Trappin' on like a traffic stop
Then sooner or later I have a knot
Got money from Bankhead to Groverland
Fuck your head back to Simpson Road
Down South fakers known for gettin' paper
Then some of the hill niggaz still know, for sho' they know
