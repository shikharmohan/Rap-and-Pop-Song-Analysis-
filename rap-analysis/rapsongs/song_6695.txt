I'm a man I gotta take care of my family
Fighting these pressures in my life
I know my mind should be on shining and getting Grammy's
But these streets won't say goodbye
I can't say goodbye, to the blocks
Goodbye, to the hood
Goodbye, to the streets
I can't say goodbye, to the hood
Goodbye, to the blocks
Goodbye, to the streets
I can't say goodbye goodbye to the blocks
Goodbye to the streets
Goodbye to the hood
I can't say goodbye, to the hood
Goodbye, to the blocks
Goodbye, to the homies
I guess it's true, you can't take the hood out a homeboy
Plus my hood just lost another homeboy
Another one got life and we don't know, if he coming home boy
They in the street tell me, "Just leave it alone boy
Let them do them take care of your own boy"
But I said, "Back brake a bound, before I was drome boy
You had dreams of being a dope boy"
Yeah, I was runnin' from the po po
Banging for the turf, late night huntin'
Puttin' me in work, good day comin', airbrush, shirt
Pay day, get the spot, got my hair cut first
Made mom sick when I wouldn't go to church
Yeah I live in the burbs but I think 21st
I know since I left that it's gotten much worse
But I'd still be there, if I couldn't write a verse
I'm a man I gotta take care of my family
Fighting these pressures in my life
I know my mind should be on shining and getting Grammy's
But these streets won't say a goodbye
I can't say goodbye
To the the blocks that raise me
The enemies and the homies that made
Me tough enough to hang on the corners that would mold me
Critics wonder if I'm tryna be the old me
But if the thing the old me ever left
Then they don't really know me
And don't know, we don't change, we just become OG
You always addicted to the life, you just don't OD
I owe the streets before they owe me
Took me in when my momma didn't want me
To wild to be a child and cops not around now
All I got now is the homies
To teach me, how to be a man an' what not
How to brake ounces in the grams an' what not
The reason I'm so nice with my hands and what not
S***, you think I forgot, man
I'm a man I gotta take care of my family
Fighting these pressures in my life
I know my mind should be on shining and getting Grammy's
But these streets won't say a goodbye
I can't say goodbye
Thank good every day that the boy could spit
And all around the world they enjoyin' my s***
I know I got plenty more wars to get
I got a beautiful wife and some gorgeous kids
But it wouldn't be right if I ignore the s***
They made me how I am, the music in the man
Told me that I can for the world gave a damn
If it wasn't for my ****, they sayin' stick to the plan
Probably be a gun instead of a pen in my hand
Probably be doin' a dub [Incomprehensible] with my man
The say leaders streets but they don't really understand
All I had was the block, when I didn't have fans
Wrapped on the corners when I couldn't get spins
All I had was the homies when I didn't have kids
If it all come down and my career was to end
I'm sure my name would live in the streets
I'm a man I gotta take care of my family
Fighting these pressures in my life
I know my mind should be on shining and getting Grammy's
But these streets won't say goodbye
I can't say goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
I can't say goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
I can't say goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
I can't say goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
You can take the man out the streets
But you can't take the streets out the man
