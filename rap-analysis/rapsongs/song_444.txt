Bone, come break 'em down
Taking no shorts, no losses, man
Bone, come break 'em down
Taking no shorts, no losses, man
Bone, come break 'em down
Taking no shorts, no losses, man
Way down, way down
I'm taking a swig of the 'burb word
Downing my fifth and I swerve
Drunk as I bend on the curb
Get up to purchase some herbs
To ease up my nerves
While a nigga got rocks to serve
Heard about thugs and hustlas
But never knew none like us before
We junking them off in dumpsters
Suck these thuggish, ruggish nuts
Peep this cut
Make a nigga wanna do some dirt
Putting in work, gotta hit 'em where it hurts
Putting it down, Bone first
And I hit 'em wid the Ouija curse
Them worse to worst
Dog, if you wanting to test Bone
The consequences are fatal
Ready be strapped, papped wid me sawed off
Clack back 'cause I believe in me label
Ruthless and we steady be putting it down
Just for the love of money, yeah
For the love of the wasteland Claire
For the love that brought me here
Dropping piece to the double glock
Ready when the trouble knocks, pop pop ya pistol now
If a nigga wanna run up, gun up
Put him on the ground, make him lay down, stay down
Harmony smooth wid the thug shit
Mo' Murda to the fool that clone
Five niggas loc'd out wid the roughness
And it's war trying crab these Bones
Bring on ya stretchers, ya dearly departed
Ya rest in the coffin for daring to cross this
Come and get that ass tossed by the boss bitch
Ain't taking no shorts or no losses
Bone, come break 'em down
Taking no shorts, no losses, man
Bone, come break 'em down
Taking no shorts, no losses, man
Bone, come break 'em down
Taking no shorts, no losses, man
Bone, come break 'em down
Taking no shorts, no losses, man
Way down, way down
Nigga come fuck wid me now
Krayzie that nigga that pump pump
Nigga that's my daily thang
Down wid the bang bang, swanging them thangs
It really don't matter, man, insane to the brain
My niggas, so how could you ever compete with the trigger?
Bitch, if you decide you want some of this now
Bite one bid and nigga, we're coming to cut ya
Everyday be the same old
Still gotta flip on the same hoe
Niggas that be trying to study the thugs
But nigga, back up, it's a Bone thing, what?
Never taking no shorts or no losses
Creeping up outta me clik, see
'Mo' Murda', 'Mo' Murda' and Ouija will be with me
Creeping on a come up doing it for the love of money
Stalking gat fools walking jack moves
Ready to pap you if we have too
Remember me, no surrender
Kill 'em and lay 'em up deep in ah coffin

Leatherface taking no shorts or no losses
Bone, come break 'em down
Taking no shorts, no losses, man
Bone, come break 'em down

They don't know when they run up, I gun 'em
Gotta let 'em know who the boss is
See, pop, pop let 'em drop
Mo' Thug, them niggas is nothing but killas
We creeping, we needing mo' money
We sick and we cold and we hungry
(Huh)
I'm loving my thugstas
My clik consist of nothing but hustlas
The nigga you know that'll hurt ya
Serve and murda all bustas now
Hard times, gotta grind, get mine
Even if it means pap, that's ya life
And a nigga gotta die by the sword
The gauge, my nine and my knife
Cocking, I pump my slugs all up in ya, now what?
Shoot a bitch just like a nigga
Ain't no favor, trigger, you fall
It's Wish Bone, no shorts, gotta get mine
Yeah, it's my time
Me and my thugs smoking, choking
Let a nigga P.O.D, off that wine
Bone, come break 'em down
Taking no shorts, no losses, man
Bone, come break 'em down
Taking no shorts, no losses, man
Bone, come break 'em down
Taking no shorts, no losses, man
Bone, come break 'em down
Taking no shorts, no losses, man
Way down, way down
Remember when that dog jumped out of the Darkside
Come creep in the barrel, bitch, if you test my hood
It'll be your loss, even if you bring your click
Get tossed and it'd do you no good
Can't fuck wid my gang, no thang
And the bullets they ring out
Strangle the man and drug 'em up off the Claire
We strip 'em and beat they brains out
I gotta give Ps to all ah my Trues
Steadily paying them dues
We niggas wid nothing to lose
Tripping and sipping on brews and acting a fool
Mo' Thug be loving to smoke mo bud
Fiend for the green leaves
Nigga, quick, pull out them trees

Now gimme now what me need
Remember, me killa cap peeler
Still a realer nigga and I'm on to dig ya
So bitch if ya run up, I'm bound to rip ya

Little Ripster get you cleared up thugs
All of my muthafuckas show they nuts and guts
Running up out the cut, pumping bucks
Ready ta fuck you up, must bust them
And steady be dumping thugging on the Claire, oh, yeah
Let's smoke out on 88th jumping wid playas
When me forty four let go, feeling the glock, glock roll
95th gunning outta the window
We peeping out the few coming outta the back do'
Hang, on the Darkside ride,
Pick up your tec and let fly, why?
I die by all of my unremorsefullest times on the nine nine
Ride, me killa, gravedigga nigga, coming up out my trench
Rest in peace and running from the holice
Jumping that barbed wire fence
Hitting the pavement dazed, the gauge was blazing
Gotta watch for the po-po raising up, up on me
Turn around and face 'em
Pump, pump and fade 'em now
