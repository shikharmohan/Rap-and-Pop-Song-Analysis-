Chorus: 2x
I will rob the still wit you
Dog nigga wha
Ride till we die, on till it's on
Thick like blood, where's my dogs?
Uh, there's my dogs
[DMX]
Now who I am is who I be until I die
Now except it or don't fuck wit it
But if we gonna be dogs then you stuck with it
Let me go my way, but walk with me
See what I see, watch me, then talk wit me
Share my pain, make it a little easier to deal wit
'cause despite all the fame you, I'ma keep it real wit
Rob the steal wit, dog nigga wha, ride till we die, on till it's on
Love is love, and I enjoy the love, but when there's conflict, then it
destroys the love
You can't toy with love, niggaz take it to the heart
You ain't gonna find too many niggaz that are willing to bark in the dark
Leave your head from the start, don't fuck it up now
Later on you gonna hit me like, fuck it up how?
You my dog and I'd die for you, let's keep it like that
Give me unconditional love and I'll give it right back
(Chorus: 2x)
[DMX]
Most niggaz make movies, but niggaz like us make it happen
Or shit we use to do, never thought we would make it rappin'
But now we here, at the same place, at the same time
Now cats joke 'cause they get it wit the same rhyme
Yeah niggaz is livin' comfortable 'cause life is all good
One thing we must remember that life is all hood
And the casket's all wood, and we all take it there one day
Shit today is Sunday, we both could be there on Monday
Life is bullied like that, WHAT?Thugged the fuck out
Sometimes I take it to the church and sometimes thug the fuck out
Niggaz get drunk the fuck out their boots, violating family rules
Mothafuckers stay in your shoes
Now see what you need to do is chill shorty
Mighty please come and get it before I kill shorty
I will do for my niggaz as what they will do for me
Bust a faggot like you for free
(Chorus)
[DMX]
I'm always surrounded by dogs for the love
The only niggaz I fuck wit is thugs, nigga wha?
Blood in blood out, pathos locos homes, Its no jokos homes, when we smoke them
cromes
And how we broke them bones
Are the last niggaz, these ass niggaz, these skemed ass niggaz, to trash
niggaz, they ass niggaz, they pussy and half you cats can't even flow
And when I hear ya'll niggaz rhyme I hear, well you know
But that's a whole nother' issue, right now we on this
We keep spittin' like this, how the fuck we gon' miss?
'cause the camp is strong, and the stamp is strong
Double r, mothafucker keep the casket blowin
You could get yourself caught up in shit you can't handle
And you, know I can't stand you, demand to
This one time I'ma let a dog be a dog
But I'ma see you in the ring and when it's on then it's on
(Chorus: 2x)
Dog nigga wha, on till it's on,
where's my dog, there's my dog
