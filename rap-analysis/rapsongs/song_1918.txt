Let us pray for those that we've lost
But know that we miss them for selfish reasons
Oh, Lord, my God, in Thee do I put my trust
Save me from all them that persecute me
And deliver me in Jesus' name
'Cuz we all go anyway, I'ma say goodbye today
'Cuz it could be any day, I'ma say goodbye today
We've grown in so many ways but I'ma say goodbye today
'Cuz it could be any day, I'ma say goodbye today
I'ma say goodbye today 'cuz I don't know when
We gon' cross paths again, until then
I'ma be that and see that speaks the truth
Believe that I'ma see that to reach the youth
My sufferin' will not be in vain neither will yo' pain
Ever since you passed, to hear your name
Rest in peace at the bottom, we all know cancer cells kill
But if they caught 'em, they coulda fought 'em
And you'd still be here right here wit us
We'd have plenty time before death came to get us
But what is death like, should I really care?
After lookin' at it, was life really fair?
Did you burn any bridges, did you make amends?
Did you ask God for forgiveness for your sins
What is Heaven like? If you could come back, should you?
If you could communicate from over there, would you?
Just questions that we ask ourselves everyday
'Cuz we all go anyway, I'ma say goodbye today
'Cuz it could be any day, I'ma say goodbye today
We've grown in so many ways but I'ma say goodbye today
'Cuz it could be any day, I'ma say goodbye today
So young, so gifted
Direction of life was uplifted, window in shifted
And took a turn for the worst but the blessing come to curse
And *** stressin' 'cuz my dawg is in the hearse
My *** Devon was way too young to die
Fell out the nest and was way too young to fly
But that didn't stop fate from happenin'
Idle time with the Devil, hate was happenin'
God, no, I didn't go that way
Comin' from his dance way, why did he go that day?
Lightly, I dare say life goes on
Don't let's stray, girls I say please be strong
He was supposed to be on the road with me
I wish somebody woulda came to get me
*** woulda had to hit me but until then my friend
I'ma say goodbye today 'cuz you never know when
'Cuz we all go anyway, I'ma say goodbye today
'Cuz it could be any day, I'ma say goodbye today
We've grown in so many ways but I'ma say goodbye today
'Cuz it could be any day, I'ma say goodbye today
Goodbye today, I'ma say goodbye today, gone away
Goodbye today, I'ma say goodbye today, it's okay
We try today, say goodbye today on your way
I'ma say goodbye today, I'ma say goodbye today
Say goodbye, know what it means
Be good 'til we meet again
I don't know what for we'll meet again
But we will meet again
Spread your wings and fly
I'll try not to cry but it'll be hard
I just miss not havin' you here
Even though I know you're in a better place
I just miss not havin' you here
Kinda selfish if you think about it
That's nature, that's life
Spirit never dies
I'll see you again
