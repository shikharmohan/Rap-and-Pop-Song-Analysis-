Still love me? Take this(cocks gun). You ready? 1, 2, 3! (Shoots gun twice)
[Chorus]
The more you put me through, the more it makes me wanna come back to you. You say you hate me, I just love you more. You don't want me, I just want you more. I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me. I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy. The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on, cuz you love me and I love you more. 
It's sick but who could ever predict we'd be doin' the same shit. We say we do it for our baby, but we don't, we do it for us. It's lust cuz neither one of us trusts the other. So we fuck till we bust. Till we cuss each other..out. We know what it's about. Shout. Till I throw you out the house, you throw me out the house. I throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth. Fist fight till we turn this mother out. And apologize after, laughter, pain. It's insane. We're back in the same chapter again. It's sad, but it's true, when I'm layin' here with you there ain't nothin' anyone could ever say or ever do. 
[Chorus]
Cuz the more you put me through, the more it makes me wanna come back to you. You say you hate me, I just love you more. You don't want me, I just want you more. I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me. I know it's sad, but it's makin' me happy. The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on. Cuz you love me and I love you more. 
Cuz I hate you, do you hate me? Good. Cuz you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry. It makes me wanna just take you and just throw you on the bed, fuck you like I don't even know you. You fuck other people, and I fuck other people. You're a slut. But I'm equal, I'm a mutt. We're both evil in our ways. But neither of us would ever admit it, cuz one of us would have one up on the other. So forget it. People can make accusations, people spread rumors.
But they ain't got proof, till they do it's just the two of us. It's just you and me. Cuz any chick can say that she's screwin' me. But you gotta believe me to a degree, cause true indeed. If you didn't, I wouldn't be hittin' you. Yeah I would. Cuz the sex is just too damn good. If I ran who would I run to? I would be the softened one. So it's off and on, usually more off than on. But at least we know that we share this common bond. You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on. I hope the only reason that I cope is cuz of that fact. And plus I can bust in that. And that's why.
[Chorus]
The more you put me through, the more it makes me wanna come back to you. You say you hate me, I just love you more. You don't want me, I just want you more. I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me. I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy. The more that you slap me the more that it turns me on, cuz you love me, and I love you more. 
I could never understand it, that's why I don't try. From junior high. Until we both die. It's silly. Oh why, must we try, is it really so rough that we must always call each other billy goat's gruff? Try to pull each others legs until the other begs. We're lyin' to ourself, that's the beauty of it, yeah. Cuz we truly love each other. That's why we always fight. All we do is shove each other every other fuckin' night. And it's clear, it ain't gonna change. It's pent-up rage. That we both have. We both feel like we've been upstaged by someone else. We both been someone else, just someone else's, someone elses' problem, Neither one wants help.It's an addiction and it can't be fixed. Our family's mixed up, there's a baby sister in the mix. And it hurts cuz the pieces to the puzzle don't fit. And anyone who thinks he knows us doesn't know shit! And they're probably just tired of hearing all the time. On every song, on every lyric and every rhyme. All the hoop-la, all of the whoopty-who. What you put me through, fuckin' whoopty-doo. But I won't be made a fool of, and this is true love. You wouldn't know what you did last time. You wouldn't screw up this time. Cuz this time girl I'm telling you what, you do it again,I'm fuckin' you up. No matter what you say, what you do. I'm gonna hunt you down till I find you. No matter where you run, I'll be right there, right behind you in your nightmares. So all of the flowers and the candy and all of the times that you threw 'em back at me. Tell me that you hate me. You gonna hate me more, when you find out, can't escape me whore. 
[Chorus]
The more you put me through, the more it makes me wanna come back to you. You say you hate me, I just love you more. You don't want me, I just want you more. I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me. I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy. The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on, cuz you love me and I love you more.
