Chorus
You must be, a radio station
And who are we, we must be
the number 1 songs, spinning all day long
and over again, and over again, and over again, and never again, and never again
And we know when, 
when we call in,
and nothings free,
sounds to me like,
state run radio x8
verse 1
We now interrupt this broadcast,
to bring you a special message about the forecast,
the futures cloudy and itÃÂ¢€s raining on the poor class,
the roads to peace are closed, and the traffic's on the war paths,
love is balling on a budget, the militaryÃÂ¢€s stressing
we need more cash, to keep fighting for your gas
keep us in our hoods and hope we never explore pass,
stay inside of your half, believe the lies you learn in your class,
that there's no treasure in your trash, & the ceiling has the same feeling,
that the floor has, and thatÃÂ¢€s where you should stay,
and this is what they play
Chorus
and over again, and over again, and never again, and never again, and never again
And we know when, 
when we call in,
and nothings free,
sounds to me like,
state run radio x8
Verse 2
YouÃÂ¢€re now tuned into the weakest,
frequency of fear, keep you locked right here,
and hope you never leave this, never be a leader,
think inside the box, and follow all procedures,
never ever believe that, you will never need this,
hit up all your friends and tell them to repeat this,
hi, your on the air, now what you want to hear?
well we ainÃÂ¢€t got the truth, but how about a remix,
different is never good, good is only what we pick,
you ainÃÂ¢€t got a hit, unless it sounds like these did,
not too smart you will be a superstar,
and if you dumb or something maybe you could be number one
Chorus
You must be, a radio station,
And who are we, we must be,
The Number 1 songs, spinning all day long,
And you put me, on daily rotation,
You on the air,
We know youÃÂ¢€re scared,
But we donÃÂ¢€t care,
Well bleep this here,
And over again, and over again, and over again, and never again, and over again
And you know when, 
when we call in,
and nothings free,
sounds to me like,
state run radio x16
