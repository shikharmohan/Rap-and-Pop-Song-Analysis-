S H I N I N on the funk
And listen to the emcees rhymin' on the funk
We solemnly swear to never bust a style that's bunk
So listen to the way that we're rhyming on the funk
Now, we would like to ask you have you ever heard this style before'
You gotta say no, 'cause there ain't no denying
And if you say yes you're lying
People are always wondering what's up with the Underground
Are they down? Or is just another new sound
We're saying things and when we use a beat we use it right
Because we're not just playing things
Spitting rhymes like a Tommy Gun spraying things
So when you see us on stage don't just stare us down
Or compare our sound yo any other crew ya like
Yo, judge how ya like
Because we are, S H I N I N on the funk
And listen to the emcees rhymin' on the funk
We solemnly swear to never bust a style that's bunk
So listen to the way that we're rhyming on the funk
Riding this like a roller coaster hugging the curves and dipping
Like I'm supposed to do for the Underground troupe
'Cause I know I'm the poop steaming hot
Stinking up the dance floor gonna do it freelance
For the funk, my friends and all the others in the industry
They want to get with me why is that, man?
Maybe it's my smooth flow they know this guy is dope
So they get hip to the style I'm using
It's called raw fusion ain't no time for ego-tripping
Let it be known there'll be no slipping on mine
'Cause all I want is a chunk of this Underground funk
S H I N I N on the funk
And listen to the emcees rhymin' on the funk
We solemnly swear to never bust a style that's bunk
So listen to the emcees rhymin' on the funk
Yo, Money B
What's up Cold Shock G?
Check it out, would you tell the people what we mean
What do you mean, what we mean?
You know what I mean
Tell 'em what we mean
When we're R H Y M I N on the funk
Let 'em know that we got spunk
We got it
And when I count to three
Go on and hit some of that Humpty-hump
One, two, three
Well, I'm Humpty-humping
You know that I'm saying something
The funk's in your face gonna keep the place jumping
As the beat keeps pumping I'm tick-toking 'em
Dope rhymes, I'm dropping 'em on the twenty-four track
And there ain't no stopping 'em
It's too late to put the tape on pause because we're
Shinin' on the funk
Shinin' on the funk
Shinin' on the funk
Shinin' on the funk
Tell me if you think the beat is nasty
We'll get ready, we're going to get sweaty
Just in case I hope you brought a towel in
I'm on the prowl when I hear the bass growling
Growling like a big bass monster
On a rampage, it's like we were on stage
Shock G speaking from the Underground
Do they understand? I really don't give a damn 'cause we're
Shinin' on the funk
Shinin' on the funk
Shinin' on the funk
