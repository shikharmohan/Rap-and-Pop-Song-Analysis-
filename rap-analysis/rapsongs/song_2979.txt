One time
Uh for these freaky hoes I lust
But I'm still flickin' ashes a lot of other motherfuckers snort dust
But that's they thang a lot of us fall victim somehow
But that's that game won't try to explain from books to bricks
Now I look, seen crooks and tricks caught up in the mix
Of everyday in every way but the right
I control the substance my people fiend for at night
Lord knows I do wrong, sound like the same old song
A lot of niggas singing homeboys conceal your weapons
'Cause ain't gonna be no smokin' section in heaven
No more be buckin' yo luck seven eleven on the first roll
Don't let the streets rock and roll yo soul
Swats GA by way of cascade heights
Gunshots, roadblocks, sidewalks and ice
Sold me out for 3.5 grams of neighborhood clout
Now what the fucks we bout I'm back home from the bullshit
Puttin' in work, meanwhile others dug ditches and covered
Themselves in dirt, one squirt and you locked down forever
Can't run from reality luring you closer and closer away
To the same old traps, now you never learn from your mistakes
So now you wear this ass whoopin' wit' pride, what side you on?
It wasn't no I in team, only in your dreams, saturated with schemes
Yeah you right, God gonna deal wit' ya fallin' from his grace
Rookie moves cops shift the game and 30 days
I'm blessed in the hole but that's till I go to the state federal
Penitentiary, yeah I could a did my time standin' on one feet
But see I fucked up royally thought I was slick
Them herpes-havin' ass crackers changed my big check to six
Times wit' Dean Whitaker's sermon of the day
But when I go to sleep I don't dream no more I just lay
A wise man knows his limitations concrete, concrete like Greg Street
Sufferin' from a severe case of inner city blues
I ain't got no clues to which directions I need to choose
This opportunity to gain is all I got to lose
'Cause I just can't settle for these streets shawty I refuse
That's the shit I like Lord got the door shot down to the pavement
Remove yo hat under the ceiling of this building
A rebuff from the usher of sorts because [Incomprehensible]
Most strive for the diamonds and overlook the gems
Got skimp wit yo bags boulders become shoulders to depend on
Which way to explore reform, refrain, we can't inflame
Every thought you walk through the trails is hell
Airborne for what clone me replace me wit' me
Another nation inside a nation out the land of Scots
Suction cups to test tube layer of skin
Supply the crust and we'll mix the fruit
Gun shows supplied me in the hour of need
Watch 'em bleed Aryan nation be the dealer
Now who's the killer? Yeah, yeah, yup yup that's the shit I like
That's the shit I like
Uh puttin' forth the effort to make a change
Not doin' a lot of talkin' bout it, what's yo game?
You slippin' you can't never do that
That's when you get jacked for yo life over emotions runnin' wild
Like salamanders swimmin' in southwest creeks
Feelin' incomplete, another story livin' [Incomprehensible]
You had it, now you lost it wasn't worth it look what it costed
Yo life young nigga
Didn't go out without a fight behind the gun trigger
You better think fast or get swept off yo feet
Nigga it hurts to see these drugs deteriorate
The minds of knuckleheads that want to be base heads
Don't say I didn't tell you 'cause you gonna see in the future
I hope I don't have to shoot you if you switch
Went from hardcore to beggin' like a bitch
Revolutions good to bad hoods to rags, real niggas to fags
What's the news? But I refuse to lose
Sufferin' from a severe case of inner city blues
I ain't got no clues to which directions I need to choose
This opportunity to gain is all I got to lose
Now I just can't settle for these streets shawty I refuse
Well I woke up this mornin' with the same frustration
From situations like these got a call about some work
From one of them temporary agencies
No high school diploma or any college degrees
I can't enlist but they'll draft me if there's a war overseas
Oh please, of course I can slice some Oz's
But see I'm one of those aspirin MC's
And uh bills are due so at times I'm doubtful and everyone disagrees
But I'd rather struggle on my feet than to live on my knees
So my uniform tight, workin' all night at Mickey D's
Got about 90 dollars and some change after the government
Get they fees, these minimum wages ain't enough to feed my babies
Purposely these limitations on black folks' opportunities
So I quit 'cause I'm tired of being one of those overworked
Underpaid employees stop carin' at all went on
And did a few small burglaries
It seems like my faith done turned into forgotten memories
And I ain't gettin' away with nothing because I know He always sees
But see right now I need to see how I can get this here dope sold
I done stuffed in my pocket as many rocks as it can hold
They gonna get high so I'm a get my money even though it's freezin' cold
Now how many times you done heard this story told?
Believe it or not, it's some very intelligent junkies
But dependencies is eatin' away at they souls like disease
Anyone can turn into somebody who covets and envies
Unequal economics can easily make you some enemies
And the crime rate never drops so the cops ride around in threes
I knew he would have killed me if I did anything but freeze
They found the rest of the dope in some nearby shrubberies
In a dim lit room being questioned by these authorities
And they gave me some time in correctional facilities
And now my woman's gotta take on a man's responsibilities
