I didn't even know a young lady could look that good
I'm ready to bounce out a queen and come to your hood
I'm ready to change your life baby, spend some cash
Because you got me chinky eyed like blunts mixed with hash
When you're in my Ferrari, look at the seats carve your ass
L drive drunk baby, pass the glass
As we run up in the club, politician with thugs
When your bra straps showin', baby girl it's love
'Cause you are the loose, talkin' and sippin' Honeypoof
Sweet as cranberry, peach schnapps and apple-loops
Runnin' with Queens finest all the way to the top
Pass cars, hard dick and plenty money to shop
Take it off, come on and dance with me baby
Take it off, there ain't nobody who can fade me
Take it off, I'm on a hot-streak lately
Take it off, you know that ass look crazy
Take it off, you saw me up in that Mercedes
Take it off, I know my crew look shady
Take it off, you see me spendin' dubs baby
Take it off, watch me dance for you baby
Wo day drive is live, Monte Carlo was ill
Convertible limousines, Def Jam got the bill
Remember R. Kelly had the house on the hill
Well, when the party's over we can go there and chill
In London, it's Big Ben style breakfast in bed
In Paris you were on an Eiffel Tower givin' me head
Go to Switzerland, private jets over the house
Come back home, ghetto style, bend you over the couch
Real niggaz, nothin' but the platinum shit
Keep that ass soakin wet, plus I'm spendin' his chips
Who's fuckin' with that, put your middle finger in the air
Has a jet passion X-man playin' with your hair
Take it off, come on and dance with me baby
Take it off, there ain't nobody who can fade me
Take it off, I'm on a hot-streak lately
Take it off, you know that ass look crazy
Take it off, you saw me up in that Mercedes
Take it off, I know my crew look shady
Take it off, you see me spendin' dubs baby
Take it off, watch me dance for you baby
Dance for me baby
Dance for me baby
Dance for me baby
Dance for me baby
To my man Black Jus baby R.I.P
Accessory to the crime is the prime Dogg 3
When we get the money baby, spreadin' the cream
To tell your brother Joe, hold it down for Queen
And to my cousin Will, hold ya head nigga chill
J.T. Damon in the car, let's get the squeels
My nigga Big Bonny Puff, glad your home
Rock the bells Melly Mell, Jimmy Love and Tone
Baby we live cats, lookin' at where we arrived at
Drug walls, hip-hop beats, how 'bout that
The rest fell so far, they can't climb back
Let's take it to the video-tape, rewind that
Take it off, come on and dance with me baby
Take it off, there ain't nobody who can fade me
Take it off, I'm on a hot-streak lately
Take it off, you know that ass look crazy
Take it off, you saw me up in that Mercedes
Take it off, I know my crew look shady
Take it off, you see me spendin' dubs baby
Take it off, watch me dance for you baby
Take it off, come on and dance with me baby
  (Everybody in the club)
Take it off, there ain't nobody who can fade me
  (Word up)
Take it off, I'm on a hot-streak lately
  (Champagne glass in the air baby)
Take it off, you know that ass look crazy
  (Just wanna pop it dog, word up)
Take it off, you saw me up in that Mercedes
(Yeah, yeah)
Take it off, I know my crew look shady
  (It's official, word up)
Take it off, you see me spendin' dubs baby
   (Rockerville)
Take it off, watch me dance for you baby
Take it off, greatest of all times
