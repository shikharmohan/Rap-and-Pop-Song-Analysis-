Run for cover, cover, cover
Remix, Missy, pass to me
In the club without the Dutches
It ain't known to me, yeah
Fish food wrapped up in a peach
Greenery gonna slur your speech like you are
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
(Yeah, it's the remix)
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
(It's ya boy)
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
(Young Buck in the mix, let's go)
Misdemeanor on the floor, pretty boy, here I come
Pumps in the bunk, make you wanna hurt something
I can take your man, I don't have to sex 'em
Hang 'em out the window, call me Michael Jackson, hee, hee, hee
I'm a pain in your rectum, I am that bitch y'all slept on
Heavy hitter, rhyme splitter, call me re-run
Hey, hey, hey, I'm what's happening
(Yeah)
Now to get my drink, that's right
Shake your ass till it stink, that's right
Mr. Mo's on the beat, that's right
Put it down for the streets, that's right
Woo
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
(Yeah, it's the remix)
Pass that Dutch, come on pass the Dutch baby
(It's the remix)
Shake, shake, shake your stuff baby
Woo
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
Pop that, pop that, jiggle that fat
Don't stop, get it till your clothes get wet
(Get it on and get crazy)
Number one, drums go bump, bump, bump
This beat here will make you hump, bump, jump
If you's a fat one put your clothes back on
Before you start putting pot holes in my lawn
(Ah)
Oh my God, show 'em I'm large a capo
