[foxy]:
Uh, uh, come on
Uh, uh, nana
Niggaz!
Yeah, you know about the na na
Everything laced up
Cartier swimwear bbs blazed up
Bare shit, let me undress
Jump in my sheer shit
Anything see-through
(mamma can I please you)
Baby boy, let me see
All of your cheese
After that, boo
I want the ice blue bentley
And we can zoom up the cancoon
In the villa room on all fours
Get up out them ice burg drawers
Come on
[playa]:
I listened to the message
That you left on my phone
The key is in my heart
Can I enter in your home
Don't act like you don't (know)
It's time to prove it (it's yours)
The time is tickin' baby
But there's one thing I've got to know
Chorus:
I wanna know, if this is on
I gotta feel, if this is real
I wanna know, if this is really so
[playa]:
The love that you're givin'
Is just blowin' my mind
The way that you are movin'
Girl I read between the lines
Are you ready (oohh)
Things are sweaty (oohh)
Oh just let me (oohh)
Love you all through the night, oh just
Take me, hold me, real tight
Ohh, all throught the night
Touch me (my baby)
Feel me (my baby)
Baby I promise that I'll make
Everything all right
(let me love you)
Chorus
[foxy]:
Anything that be gliterin' ain't gold
Any bad bitch that you ran up in ain't old
17 with the mean thing try me
See me in the coupe with my phillopean mommys
If you say we could play slow
Get toed while the liquer flow
Crystial not moe
Boo, after the show we could hit the telle-flow
Get your back blown out
In a black thai-hold baby
Take me, hold me, real tight
Ohh, all throught the night
Touch me (my baby)
Feel me (my baby)
Baby I promise that I'll make
Everything all right
(let me love you)
Chorus
