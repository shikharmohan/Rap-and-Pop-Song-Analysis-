Keep it chicken head, I'm lookin' for a dime
Get my swerve on, make it hot, word is bond
I'm lickin' on your ankle bracelet
We'll be sippin' moet wit strawberries and dat shit
I'm nasty ask me, why I lick my lips
So in the darkness I can run my tongue over your tits
It's all good sugary, you ain't leavin', sit up on my face
And help my stash grow even
Whipped cream taste mean from the back
She bounce wit'll now shorty's on the map
I put away the gat, took off the hat, throw ya mo's in the air
If you like it like that, no doubt boo
I keep it real girl, mad pleasure
Blowin' up your whole world
Whatever's clever I got endless cash
Trees from Hawaii, 2 pools or baths
I'll be loungin' with LL Cool J
I'll be loungin' with LL, hey, hey

I'll be loungin' with LL, hey, hey
Uh, my scenario is grand, a dime piece
Hennessey up in my hand
I turn out the lights like teddy, I'm feenin'
Standin' in the darkness
Now I'm ready, uhh, ooh yeah up in ya
Let it flow while I pump slow
Then I speed it up, heat it up
Make it mo' tasty, so you can swing low and lace me
Use your imagination, you do me, I do you ,sex education
It's all good, it's Cranberry Absolut, Peach Schnapps
Feelin' tipsy, loungin'' on the rooftops
I'm 'bout to spank you on dat ass
(Ooh)

(True)
When you need it who you ask
(You)
What you sayin' when I dash
(Don't go boo)

You got to bounce wit me suga, word up
You got to bounce wit me suga, word up
You got to bounce wit me suga, word up

Warm it up suga, make it hot, shorties'll swarm
Make me wanna bust shots
We speak daily on the regular
Run your jibs all day chip in my cellular
Shoot down to Jamaica, pretty white sand
Suntan oil, Pina Coladas in your hand
Layin' up at night, peepin' at stars
Remember when we was at the club in da bars?
I told ya my status was that of a don
You thought I was a dog and you ain't wanna get it on
But my mind has attractin' qualities
All the emotions of a young lady
So here you are, smack dab up in the mix
Shorty this here's about as good as it gets
Word up, I'ma treat you like a queen from the heart
Crack the bubbly,and let the episode start
I'll be loungin' with LL Cool J
I'll be loungin' with LL, hey, hey
I'll be loungin' with LL Cool J
I'll be loungin' with LL, hey, hey
