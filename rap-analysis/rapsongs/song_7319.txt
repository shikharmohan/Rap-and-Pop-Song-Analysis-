Alright man, y'all win
I won't say it, at least for this song, hey
I said they lookin' for the realest, well, I'm real as it get
Rap to the nigga dealin' hard who live in the 'jects
'Til some better nigga wit her, ain't delivered 'em yet
My mouth is, but I got a pistol bigger than that
I live and die by my respect so I honor the code
Peep niggaz who be out here flexin', stuntin' for hoes
And if you ain't never chose to remember nothin' before
Just know the game is some you win and some you don't
But you already begin again, start, it go
Learn to shoot a pistol, flip a O, how hard it go
Man, if you ain't ever heard of Pimp Squad before
You better ask a real nigga or a broad you know
'Cause you ain't ready for the pros, get it outta ya brain
You in over your head, way out of your lane
I been sayin' I'm filthy rich and got it from Caine
So would you say them niggaz know if they done got it the same, right?
'Cause you know who, you know what
Of the you know where, goin' against us, too unfair
'Cause everywhere you do a show, we got kinfolk there
And now you know I ain't no more, not a tin folk there
It's you know who, you know what
Of the you know where, beef now don't you go there
And if you do, do not use our copy producers, he won't care
If he leave the hood alone, pimpin' he won't share man
I know you think you out there gettin' it in
But whatcha doin', I done did it once and did it again
I had a trap between runnin' while living in sin
He done settlin' down, turnin' nine million or ten
I give a damn if I never sell a million again
I gotta thank you a million for just lettin' me in
But now I'm settlin' in, gettin' used to the view
On top, won't stop 'til I'm huger than you
Gon' flop? Who? Me, pimp you losin' your screws
We gotta dope if you lettin' niggaz shoot into you
No, you ain't ready for the shit I'm introducin' to you
The roof in the back of the park ain't translucent as you
So now your nigga dressin' up, man, do what you do
I got style, pimp, it's more than just the suit and the shoe
This been proven, I'm the truth, stamp government seal
I'm more than any of these other niggaz
Just Southern with deals, for real
'Cause you know who, you know what
Of the you know where, goin' against us, too unfair
'Cause everywhere you do a show, we got kinfolk there
And now you know I ain't no more, not a tin folk there
It's you know who, you know what
Of the you know where, beef now don't you go there
And if you do, do not use our copy producers, he won't care
If he leave the hood alone, pimpin' he won't share man
