EPMD, check it
I make a million bucks
Every six months and y'all
Hating my game, saying my name
They call me the E, wrong things
Knowing I'm fly without wings
While some of y'all have to pull strings
In this era I maintain the freak upon the beats
Master baselines of Raphael Saadiq
Lyrical mastermind, a genius so don't snooze
No missions impossible, ask Tom Cruise
I keep a joint lit, when I have to spit
I rough paragraph, laugh
When I'm busting yo' ass, who want it?
Come and see me like 112
And I'll rock that bell with Fox and L
E-Dub, Mr Excitement, right
The poltergeist of rap so come to the light
Yes, the recipient of this award goes to Moi
The best qualified superstar
My squad stays on point like
Den en den den de den, it's the joint
Yeah, my squad stay on point like
Den en den den de den, it's the joint
New York, I'm in your area, over here
DC, I'm in your area, over here
New Jersey, I'm in your area, over here
EPMD, it's a world premier
It's the joint, stay on point plus I'm feelin' it
Niggas killin' shit tryin' to duplicate the manuscript
That's impossible, pray like the gospel
Over coming set backs and jumping over obstacles
Like Evil Ken evil, on point like a needle
EPMD's like the Beatles, back with another sequel
To hip hop, check one two and you don't stop
Rap with mainstream R&B; and pop, now the worlds shocked
The E-doubles back with Mic-Doc
Like it or not we bout to turn it up another notch
My speeds put it down for my seeds
Raw breeds, acres with the deeds, its the joint.
My squad stays on point like
Den en den den de den, it's the joint
Yeah, my squad stay on point like
Den en den den de den, it's the joint

I got millions of chips and they stack like that
A five year spread and now we back like that
How dare they, niggas sittin' in they room with Brandy
Way pissed off thikin' how the can't stand me
He rhyme Shawn for his Penn, talking
Not lookin', shocken a dead man walking
You know me from rippin' shows wit my homie
The one and only, Ginuwine like Pony
You want a ride? Call me up when you're lonely
I'm Parish Smith and shit, Great like Tony
I'm hittin', hittin'
Where from? From Brentwood to San Quentin
I'ma keep rhyming, still representing, fro who?
For my niggas up north and in the courts
And for the emcees taking no shorts in this blood sport
