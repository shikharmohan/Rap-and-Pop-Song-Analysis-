Hello, I started this gangsta shit
And this the motherfuckin' thanks I get?
Hello, I started this gangsta shit
And this the motherfuckin' thanks I get? Hello
The motherfuckin' world is a ghetto
Full of magazines, full clips and heavy metal
When the smoke settle, I'm just lookin'
For a big yellow in six inch stilettos
Dr. Dre, hello, percolatin', keep em waitin'
While you sittin' here hatin', yo bitch is hyperventilatin'
Hopin' that we penetratin', you gets natin'
'Cause I never been to Satan for hardcore administratin'
Gang bang affiliatin', MC Ren'll have you wildin' off a zone
And a whole half a gallon, get to dialin', 911 emergency
And you can tell 'em, it's my son he's hurtin' me
And he's a felon on parole for robbery
Ain't no coppin' a plea, ain't no stoppin' a G
I'm in the 6, you got to hop in the 3, company monopoly
You handle shit sloppily, I drop a ki properly
They call me the Don Dada, pop a collar
Drop a dollar, if you hear me you can holla
Even rottweilers follow the Impala
Wanna talk about this concrete? Nigga I'm a scholar
The incredible, heterosexual, 'credible, beg a hoe
Let it go, dick ain't edible, nigga ain't federal, I plan shit
While you hand picked motherfuckers givin' up transcripts

Villain blows up yo spot, take yo notebook, yo bitch and yo glock
This motherfucker thought the coochie had a padlock
You slapped her ass, that's alarmin'
'Cause she want my worm like Carmen
We chin check niggaz, them thin check niggaz
Run trains on gold diggers, beware these foe niggaz
Scarin' motherfuckers like Stephen King flicks
Makin' niggaz clear the room like a dyke flee a dick
Makin' 2nd II None shit, nigga like Quik
So when I bomb first, nigga who you rollin' with?
Fuck that ice on your wrist, fuck yo fine ass bitch
'Cause you could lose it in a tussle, nigga watch me hustle
Watch niggaz kiss my ass without flexin' a muscle
Bitches, all in the back, they knees waitin' to buckle
Same time, same channel, don't change the dial
Niggaz4Life, fuckin' your wife, these niggaz wild
Hello, I started this gangsta shit

Hello, I started this gangsta shit
And this the motherfuckin' thanks I get? Hello
Did I fall off? Got you in your room
Rippin' every Chronic poster on your wall off
Just 'cause I put away the sawed off
Now I got you sittin' back with a smirk
Listenin' with your arms crossed
Questionin' Dre's credibility, what?
Wonderin' if it's still in me to produce hits
Y'all be killin' me as if I need to make more, I got a mansion
And six cars that are paid for, suck my dick, hello
We came a long way from not givin' a fuck
Sellin' tapes out of a trunk to movin' this far up
Now we got the whole world starstruck
Made a million plus and still don't give a motherfuck
Motherfucker, I'm Dre, I don't need your respect
I don't need to make another album, bitch I don't gotta do shit
I do it because I want to not to stay in the game
Fuck the fame, I'm still stayin' the same, lil' bitch
