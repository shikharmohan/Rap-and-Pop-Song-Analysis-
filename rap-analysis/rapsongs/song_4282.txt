Pardon my gang affil,
But you're stepping on a rod in the danger field,
Weezy Baby, how do the Manger feel?
Respect my aim because I aim to kill,
Hahaha, Old bitch ass nigga,
Abercrombie and Fitch ass nigga,
I talk rich shit because I'm a rich ass nigga,
I hope you in the zone because I pitch fast nigga,
Ha, I smoke something bitch,
My money comes faster than the roadrunner bitch,
I keep it on the side just in case you might wonder,
Tec 9 Four 5 just in case you like numbers,
Haha, bitch nigga we might jump ya,
2 Step all in yo face, we might Unk ya,
Hahaha, bandana on the right side,
East side until I die,
You better change like it's Mardi Gras,
And we pull guns like Quick Draw McGraw,
See I'm from New Orleans, Louisiana,
And he's from Compton, baby, bandana,
We carry them caskets, we tote them hammers,
Su to the Woop, yeah, that's our grammar,
Lemme hear you say Su Woop,
Su Woop, Su Woop,
