Hey, wooo, ooooh, hey yeah, oooh now
If I had one wish
That wish would be clear
That I would not have to go
That I could stay here
And although it hurts me
To leave you all alone
Just know IÃÂ¢€ll come back to you
For now I am gone
Gone, for now I am gone [x's 2]
(For now I am gone, for now I am gone,
for now I am gone, for now I am..gone [x's 2])
[Krayzie Bone]
When IÃÂ¢€m dead and gone donÃÂ¢€t even worry
DonÃÂ¢€t mourn me too long death-a get ya discouraged
KeepinÃÂ¢€ your vision blurry, prison and mentally hurtinÃÂ¢€
I know it for certain if IÃÂ¢€m really restinÃÂ¢€ in heaven
No need for you to fear donÃÂ¢€t cry
ÃÂ¢€ÃCause death wonÃÂ¢€t forever have a grip on our life
So IÃÂ¢€m-a be coming big?(bet) ready for the last shine
ÃÂ¢€ÃCause I am a believer that IÃÂ¢€ll see a resurrection
DonÃÂ¢€t believe that IÃÂ¢€ll burn in hell
I study the scriptures and they learn me well
No trippinÃÂ¢€, no drippinÃÂ¢€, no purgatory I dwell
I sleep, I rest in peace ÃÂ¢€til I prevail
ItÃÂ¢€s just a temporary lay down I wonÃÂ¢€t forever stay down
So keep me in your memory donÃÂ¢€t let me fade out
IÃÂ¢€ll probably never see you at the crossroads
Guess I was wrong IÃÂ¢€m gone, gone, long gone
[Chorus]
If I had one wish
That wish would be clear
That I would not have to go
That I could stay here
And although it hurts me
To leave you all alone
Just know IÃÂ¢€ll come back to you
For now I am gone
[Layzie Bone]
We hit the road back in 1993
Had a vision like a prophet
The project was go see
The logic was so deep
I come back and do a lotta good
I heard ya callinÃÂ¢€ so I headed out to Hollywood
One way tickets, my n-ggas and no fear
Some said that we was trippinÃÂ¢€ the mission was so clear
DonÃÂ¢€t wanna go there, the money was over there
I still love ya ÃÂ¢€Ã99, I miss ya St. Claire
Yeah, now IÃÂ¢€m movinÃÂ¢€ on a rollercoaster
Just ridinÃÂ¢€ tryinÃÂ¢€ to be JehovahÃÂ¢€s soldier
And IÃÂ¢€m grindinÃÂ¢€ tryinÃÂ¢€ to make it better for ya
So for now I best be gone, be gone
I made a vow to change the world somehow
IÃÂ¢€ma impact it and see it in this lifetime
On the dark road to bring back the sunshine
But for now IÃÂ¢€m gone, I gotta go get it
[Chorus]
[Wish Bone]
If itÃÂ¢€s out there to get
Then IÃÂ¢€ma go and get it
Get it ÃÂ¢€til I got nothinÃÂ¢€ left, chasinÃÂ¢€ better livinÃÂ¢€
ItÃÂ¢€s a ÃÂ¢€Ãtinuos mission, so IÃÂ¢€m steady movinÃÂ¢€
And I gotta get it in, never settle for losinÃÂ¢€
IÃÂ¢€m a thug true, add to or get out the way
You could settle for less but I need more on my plate
EatinÃÂ¢€ good, family good
Okay, ÃÂ¢€til that day, IÃÂ¢€m-a get up and move, move
Show my babies how the thug do, ooh
IÃÂ¢€m-a play it like itÃÂ¢€s my last game
If itÃÂ¢€s due better give it up right away
ÃÂ¢€ÃCause a thug n-ggas gonna bring pressure
See me f-cked up, starvinÃÂ¢€ n-gga never
And as long as n-ggas out here gettinÃÂ¢€ paid
Back to my old ways
Who they gonna run and tell, huh?
ItÃÂ¢€s a street thang, come on
[Chorus]
[Flesh]
Yeah we ready, back up in ÃÂ¢€Ãem
Wit nothinÃÂ¢€ but that harmony rhythm
Hard hittinÃÂ¢€ flows all we give ÃÂ¢€Ãem
Flows that spit venom
No cop there goes the end of ÃÂ¢€Ãem
Ever since the beginning we winninÃÂ¢€ it
Get a glimpse of legends standinÃÂ¢€ on deck
ÃÂ¢€ÃTil we come, we be here holdinÃÂ¢€ down the set
Keep on wonderinÃÂ¢€ what the Bone ÃÂ¢€bout to do next
Still they humble and the hungriest, God bless
The fan fam flex, all across the U.S.
Overseas and Tel Aviv and back west
You know we go the hardest
No need to say we better than the rest
ItÃÂ¢€s obvious more less
Came down off my high from the wet
When I had to do a stretch
I signed so I cashed the check
Had me caught up in a game, insane
My head blown, whatÃÂ¢€s goinÃÂ¢€ on
ÃÂ¢€ÃCause ainÃÂ¢€t nobody home
[Chorus]
