Intro: Akon]
Ima make shure you never forget me...(forget me) [fade]
[Chorus: Akon]
Going thru the strugles everyday on this pavement
n every hood i see em doin the same
theres alot of haters that dont want me to make it
all i want is for you to remember my name
So that you never forget me
So that you never forget me ohhhhuhhhohhh
So that you never forget me
So that you never forget me ohhhhuhhhohhh
[Verse: Krayzie Bone]
When Im dead and gone
They gon remember me 
As being one of the livest
Then when you were ghetto surviving
When they be temporary silent
Poppin there mind 
The silent Killer!
Straight off the ghetto a grimey nigga
With lyrics more podent than a fight with venom
One bite cud kill em
And knock em little niggas never knew wat had him em
Legends! From what we then did on the streets to what we did spit on these records
Blessings! We take em they put em on beats and we give em back no question
Run deadly in a Midwest
Crazy Jackson( Jackson)
The lyrical serial killer
Im fillin the illest of niggas dats askin of the mighty master
When it come to the rhyme Im faster than half of these niggas rappin
When it come to the grind Im massin no time for second chances
When it all goes down when they put me in my grave
**** em all cross my tombstome and bury me with my gage g 
[Chorus]
[Verse: Layzie Bone]
My reputection is solid gold 
an my street credits all polished yall
known as a lil boss hawk in the hood boy in my hood ima superstar
niggaz in tha pen tryna hold a ***** down but i put in my work in check it check it
nah these niggaz respect it
knowin im the wrong one they wanna mess wit
from the gutter wit my brothers 
knowin these ghetto streets they dont love us
duckin these undercovers these motha fuckers doin everything to try ta bust us
but these suckaz know they cant touch us 
they envy deep in they hearts
if they eva try to rush us ***** they know we gone rip em apart
niggaz go hard from tha start 
***** this nina ross is my body guard
**** wit mine n ill charge lil krayzy *** ***** at large
pullin cards on these lame niggas ill neva let go of my heat
yea stand up man on his feet
lil layzies bone and them 3...memba me
[Chorus]
[Verse: Wish Bone]
What I got to do to for you not to forget who brought you that straight thug spit
Sped up a little bit with gangsta talk with dat harmony all ova it
Hey bone slang(slang)
Till we mixed it wit dat street talk
And with no delay easy e let us get our creep on
And then he went home but its all gud
He left the right ones once hes still in the hood
Rest in peace(peace)
Like him when I die I hope they rememba me
That's why I no lie when I reach you wit dese beats
its not for nothin rememba the thugs for the soul that we song 
And makin the struggle that struggle
It aint easy believe me
Get breezy believe it
Still goin on up so games strong but I do it so they rememba me
[Akon:]
Going thru the strugles everyday on this pavement
n every hood i see em doin the same
theres alot of haters that dont want me to make it
all i want is for you to remember my name
So that you never forget me
So that you never forget me ohhhhuhhhohhh
So that you never forget me
So that you never forget me ohhhhuhhhohhh
