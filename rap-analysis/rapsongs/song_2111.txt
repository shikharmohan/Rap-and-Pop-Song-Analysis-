Forty wadah
Ehh, yeah
We do this for life ya dumb fucks, y'all niggaz is dump trucks
The type to bitch up and getcha eyebrows plucked
Mark my words loco gon' have it like Motown's heyday
So dope they name us all twice like we, Pelle Pelle
You better be prepared to call me Bullet Loco Gorde
Pop my collar with none other than Earl-40
Square off on a square like it's high noon 'cause I'm a tycoon
If you fuck with Sick Wid it, y'all niggaz gon' die soon
I can't make a fiend do nothin' against they will
I just leave they eyes so yellow you see 'em and yell
Whoa, spill the guts of the ones that's not real
So when you see me nigga scream out one shot kill
Gotta, spot on my shoe from all the blood we spill
I get it even if I don't want it nigga like free refills
Y'all don't wanna give us our props, y'all niggaz gon' get dropped
Nigga fuck hip hop, nigga this crip hop, what?
Pimp'n why you splurgin'?
('Cause I can)
Why you go up in my bitch?
(Nigga 'cause I can)
Why you smokin' all that broccoli?
('Cause I can)
Why everybody think you rich?
(Nigga 'cause I am)
Pimp'n why you splurgin'?
('Cause I can)
Why you go up in my bitch?
(Nigga 'cause I can)
Why you smokin' all that broccoli?
('Cause I can)
Why everybody think you rich?
(Nigga 'cause I am)
Motherfucker [Incomprehensible] grew up on the undertuckamajig
My destination control the block
Fast ass wad full of ones in my pocket
With a hundred dollar bill wrapped on top
Thirty two shot extended clip to keep it trill when I pop
Durin' the summer it's Zenith's but in the winter ride stock
Better believe us don't try to play us for false
'Cause it's not a game no way no how
Bullet Loco, Charlie Hustle and Major Payne nigga now
[Incomprehensible] try'na deal with it?
Fuck around and wind up gettin' killed with it
New booty rappers get penalized and expedited
'Cause they don't think about they shit before they write it
We don't sell narcotics with the po po problems, playboy take a look
We off into real estate, CD's, millions of books
Used to be crooks still hang around crooks, dealers and ex cons
Niggaz with Lucci from slangin' that alcohol and shermon
Players with cake, pushin' they weight, try to find the last trap
Transfer they bloody bread to illegal corporate scratch, what they want?
Pimp'n why you splurgin'?
('Cause I can)
Why you go up in my bitch?
(Nigga 'cause I can)
Why you smokin' all that broccoli?
('Cause I can)
Why everybody think you rich?
(Nigga 'cause I am)
Pimp'n why you splurgin'?
('Cause I can)
Why you go up in my bitch?
(Nigga 'cause I can)
Why you smokin' all that broccoli?
('Cause I can)
Why everybody think you rich?
(Nigga 'cause I am)
Are y'all fools ready for dis? It's for loco for sure I'll blast
With Bullet loco and 40 water we take your life then we haul ass
Tall cash stacked in the basement
Can't leave the house with less than a zip an a extra clip
Niggaz wanna know why I get down like this ain't that a bitch?
You see my, life on TV
'Cause it's the daddy with the [Incomprehensible] and a P
Niggaz just can't seem to get away from PD while they surrounded me
And houndin' me 'cause I ball hard, on parole in a Double-R
Fifty to a hundred G's and jewels on wrists, nigga we ghetto stars
Shit my niggaz spent G's and push drop Bentleys
Remi Mark sippin', Cristal, X-O Hennesey
And better believe if we enemies, we spray ya wit these
Every night at twelve have your whole motherfuckin' city prayin' on knees
And still 40-Water pass the strap and I blast, Jayo hit the gas
Had to tear his whole motherfuckin' head off tryin' to get to his stash
Every man they all man, quick to pull a lick out the Brougham
Only reason I rode down on that bitch ass nigga, is because I can
Pimp'n why you splurgin'?
('Cause I can)
Why you go up in my bitch?
(Nigga 'cause I can)
Why you smokin' all that broccoli?
('Cause I can)
Why everybody think you rich?
(Nigga 'cause I am)
Pimp'n why you splurgin'?
('Cause I can)
Why you go up in my bitch?
(Nigga 'cause I can)
Why you smokin' all that broccoli?
('Cause I can)
Why everybody think you rich?
