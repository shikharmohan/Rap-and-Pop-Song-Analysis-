Intro: Biggie 
Uhh check it out uhh 
*singing* I steps in where the Mo's and the hoes at bay bee! 
Fuck all that pretty shit 
Takin it back to the gutter for you motherfuckers 
Niggaz know the deal 
Niggaz know who the Don is 
Live from Bedford Stuyvesant the livest one 
Peep game uhh what what 
Verse One: Puff Daddy 
Out of this world like Mars when I spit these bars 
Come fuck with these stars up in luxury cars 
We built them radars to stay free from the cops 
Crucial choices to make, like A-C or the drop 
Are we gonna stop? Shit man never my squad go broke 
Your squad arti-choke 
Watch your circle vanish like cigar smoke 
Ain't no joke, when your ones don't show 
Nigga I know, might say 'Been There Done That' like Dre 
Through hard work I earn the vault 
Promise God to never look back or I turn to salt 
Got nice watches nice cars nice bitches and rings 
Guess it's safe to say a nigga like me got nice things 
Can't relate to motherfuckers, who ain't go no cake 
When you all fucked up, and can't get no break 
When your fake ass friends, don't help you out when you need it 
Be on some real bullshit, politely tell you to beat it 
Fuck that, get your own nigga, don't ask me for shit 
That's what I did, now they all askin for hits 
Nigga it's on for the simple fact I let it be known 
We still fly but seperately cause now I, charter my own 
Propellers, Goodfellas, leave all them playa haters jealous 
Billboard charts should tell us, they can't touch us 
Why niggaz bring the ruckus? 
Because release day is bigger than Mandela's, motherfuckers 
Chorus: 
Just some ghetto boys 
Living in these ghetto streets -- these ghetto streets 
And everyday they gotta fight to stay alive 
It's just reality 
Verse Two: Jay-Z 
Yeah, make you a deal, check 
These here's the dog years and motherfuckers don't shed 
I try to bring you life but motherfuckers want dead 
So I travel with the babble, with the chrome, with the lead 
Cause when it's on, then it's on, the shots flowin through your head 
I been rich I been poor I saved and blown bread 
Some say I been here before because of the way I zone 
Some said, Jigga zone is like the fallin of Rome 
Reoccuring, that he thinks like that cause he's observing 
Won't be known until I'm gone and niggaz study my bones 
Mentally been many places, but I'm Brooklyn's own 
In the physical, onee seems, like a lost body 
In fact my thoughts don't differ much from that of God body 
But it's the odd shottie, that got cats, likening me 
to the mob John Gotti, rap dudes bitin me cause 
I got it locked like the late Bob Marley 
Pardon me y'all, the great Bob Marley 
Solemnly we mourn, all the rappers that's gone 
Niggaz that got killed in the field and all the babies born 
Know they ain't fully prepared for this New World Order 
So I keep it ghetto like sunflower seeds and quarter waters 
You walk em through it, you know, talk em through it 
Know these beads is more than music whenever I talk to it 
Destined for greatness and y'all knew this, when I doubled the pie 
Had a shorty and a girdle comin out of B-W-I (in school) 
I hated algebra but I loved to multiply 
And I told my nigga Big I'd be multi before I die 
It's gonna happen whether rappin or clappin have it your way 
Cause if that's my dough you're trappin, I'm clappin your way 
Chorus 
Verse Three: Notorious B.I.G. 
Damn it feel good to see people up on it 
Flipped two keys in two weeks and didn't flaunt it 
My brain is haunted, with mean dreams 
GS's with BB's on it, supreme schemes, to get Richer 
than Richie, quickly, niggaz wanna hit me 
If they get me, dress my body in linen by Armani, check it 
My lyrical carjack, make your brains splat 
High caliber gats is all I fuck with, now peep the rough shit 
in my circumfrence, mad bitches, with mad lucci 
Bulletproof vestes under they coochie 
Spittin my uzi, don't lose me, my trigga niggaz represent 
Drivin dirty in J-30's gettin bent 
And to my hit hoes, my murder mommies 
I be smokin trees in Belize when they find me 
While you still killin niggaz with punany, like heiny 
and Cyrus up in Cypress fuck you raw you on the floor with the virus 
While I just, slang coke, smoke pounds to choke 
Got lawyers watchin lawyers so I won't go broke, now check it 
Them country niggaz call me Frank White 
I'm squirtin off in my loft of course I know my shit's tight 
Sunrise open my eyes no surprise 
Got my shorty flyin in with keys taped to her thighs 
With all the utensils, who hang my china thing 
She half black half oriental eighty-six she got me rental 
The situation ain't accidental.. 
What? From a, from a young G's perspective.. (repeat 2X) 
Chorus 2X to fade
