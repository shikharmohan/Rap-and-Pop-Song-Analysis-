Beyonce:
Every night I rest in my bed
hopin maybe i'll get a chance to see you when i close my eyes
I'm goin out of my head
lost in a fairy tale
you hold my hand
and be my guide
Life is filled with stars from other skies
and i hope it rains
ur the perfect lullaby
(what kind of dream is this)
it could be a sweet dream
or a beautiful nightmare
either way i
dont wanna wake up with you
Nicki Minaj:
Young money rite here

It could be a sweet dream
or a beautiful nightmare
