I want to thank You, Heavenly Father
For shining Your light on me
You sent me someone who really loves me
And not just my body
He keeps me happy so very happy he loves me
I don't know how to be
It's been a long time since I had someone who loves me
I owe my thanks to Thee
I know it could not happen without Your love
Ooh without Your love
It took a long time for it to happen
But I knew those nights I prayed
That You would send me someone who's real
And not no one for play
I kept the faith and didn't worry
My nights grew longer than the days
Until one day it really happen
He sent true love my way
I know it couldn't have happened without You
Ooh without You
When the time is right He'll fill your life with love and care
Believe and He'll be there
Just do all right don't do no wrong and the keep the faith
For love will shine His light your way
Thank You Father for shining Your light on me
I prayed a long time for it to happen
I did 'cause I believe
He makes me happy, so very happy
I don't know how to be
It's been a long time since I had someone who loves me
I owe my thanks to Thee
I know it couldn't have happened without You
Ooh without You
I know it couldn't have happened without Your love
  (My nights were long and blue, until He sent me you)
Ooh without Your love
I know it couldn't have happened without You
  (My nights were long and blue, until He sent me you)
Ooh without You
I know it couldn't have happened without You
  (My nights were long and blue, until He sent me you)
Ooh without You
I know it couldn't have happened without You
  (My nights were long and blue, until He sent me you)
Ooh without You
