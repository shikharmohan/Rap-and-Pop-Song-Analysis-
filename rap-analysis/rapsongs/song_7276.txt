Shawty saw the drop top like the bezzle in my watch
Shawty saw the drop top like the bezzle in my watch
Shawty saw the drop top like the bezzle in my watch
Like the bezzle in my watch, like the bezzle in my watch
Shawty saw the drop top like the bezzle in my watch
Shawty saw the drop top like the bezzle in my watch
Shawty saw the drop top like the bezzle in my watch
Like the bezzle in my watch, like the bezzle in my watch
Shawty saw the drop top like the bezzle in my watch
Shawty saw the drop top like the bezzle in my watch
Shawty saw the drop top like the bezzle in my watch
Like the bezzle in my watch, like the bezzle in my watch
I came up bumpin' Eazy-E, Cube and Dre
(Scarface, Outkast what's happenin' niggaz)
Eightball MJG, UGK they raised me like Santa raised cee
I always made the money, money never made me
Break me what this bitch you crazy
You seen with the freaks don't think she never paid me
Pimpin' get a bitch, break a bitch, hit a bitch, shake a bitch
Spit game till I make this shit turn these tricks and get me rich
Lick his ass suck my dick bring me back my niggaz quick
Who you think you fuckin' with? I'm serious about this pimpin' shit
All the niggaz I kick it with lookin' for a richer bitch
Get this bitch to take this trick for pounds of weed bricks and shit
Broke bitch you get your shit before I get another bitch
Who could fix your shit, my pimp strong I ain't with your shit
You goin' to make me split your shit
Two things I ain't seen is this you a phony bitch I can't get
Eyes on the ride yeah, right shut the fuck
Shawty saw the drop top like the bezzle in my watch
Shawty saw the drop top like the bezzle in my watch
Shawty saw the drop top like the bezzle in my watch
Like the bezzle in my watch, like the bezzle in my watch
Shawty saw the drop top like the bezzle in my watch
Shawty saw the drop top like the bezzle in my watch
Shawty saw the drop top like the bezzle in my watch
Like the bezzle in my watch just like the bezzle in my watch
Whole mack load it up hard as fine blow it up
MJG I know you hoes and been exposed enough
I cross a tree over bag, a bitch in a toaster oven
Slam dunk in pimpin' and her sister if she close enough
Look over here open up the door and let it cook in here
Grab the mic and weak niggaz tuck there tail and look in fear
As I bust around with no shells from inside in myself
Lyrics like a counseled weapon sendin' you bitches straight to hell
Burnin' up just like in Waco Texas, heatin' up your necklace
Scorchin' up your afro the devil comin' at your
Ass any hard one for niggaz who really want it
MJ fuckin' G with pussy and titties on it
Them bitches love it when they see pimpin' come up in it
24 inches under somethin smokin' tinted
Hustle hard for keep it 'cause I love to spend it
Pimpin' love is when your style is when you love to hit it
Shawty saw the drop top like the bezzle in my watch
Shawty saw the drop top like the bezzle in my watch
Shawty saw the drop top like the bezzle in my watch
Like the bezzle in my watch, like the bezzle in my watch
Shawty saw the drop top like the bezzle in my watch
Shawty saw the drop top like the bezzle in my watch
Shawty saw the drop top like the bezzle in my watch
Like the bezzle in my watch, just like the bezzle in my watch
I came a long way from a posta, posta
Till I kosta nostra kept the toaster closer
Than I'm supposed to well I poast ya 'procha
Ride like a roller coaster, pistol whip you hold ya throat
Then choke you like a croacha, croacha rocha
Pull out a light and smoke you, damn
Pull my coat off I blessed man just stressed man
Just still elementary just a glance couldn't learn
It is hurtin' my chances, pack pistols just to blast it
I blast it just to prove it
I put it to second guessers, mother fuckers get a movin'
I born into hustlin' I grew up tustlin'
Gave my muscle in and got into meetin' my frail but hell I put my trust in
My left and right hand grindin' threw the night
And I keep my family right and see some paper like a white man
Ballin' in the night and we holdin' in the light and sippin' on worthless
Sprite and you can call it what you like
I call what the fuck I feel play the courts that fuckin' peel
But we ain't sleepin' till they free the pimp and that's the fuckin' drill
Shawty saw the drop top like the bezzle in my watch
Shawty saw the drop top like the bezzle in my watch
Shawty saw the drop top like the bezzle in my watch
Like the bezzle in my watch, like the bezzle in my watch
Shawty saw the drop top like the bezzle in my watch
Shawty saw the drop top like the bezzle in my watch
Shawty saw the drop top like the bezzle in my watch
Like the bezzle in my watch, just like the bezzle in my watch
Shawty saw the drop top like the bezzle in my watch
Shawty saw the drop top like the bezzle in my watch
Shawty saw the drop top like the bezzle in my watch
Like the bezzle in my watch, like the bezzle in my watch
Shawty saw the drop top like the bezzle in my watch
Shawty saw the drop top like the bezzle in my watch
Shawty saw the drop top like the bezzle in my watch
Like the bezzle in my watch, like the bezzle in my watch
