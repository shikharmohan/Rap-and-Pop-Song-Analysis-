Phat phat, uh and along came Pos, phat phat
It's a sure bet
When I stare into your dark browns I get
Overwhelmed, overjoyed, overstep
My bounds, on your touchy subject
Your weight, shape's not what I date
It's you, my crew don't mind it thick, uh uh
Every woman ain't a video chick, nah
Or runway model, anorexic
I love what I can hold and grab on
So if you burn it off, keep the flab on
We gonna stay gettin' our collab on, ow
Girl, we gonna stay gettin' our collab on, ooh ooh

Don't stuck on the things they say, now you know it's a nasty world
Tryna get witcha anyway 'cuz I know your a nasty girl

Claim you outta shape, you not outta place, uh-uh
You keep it natural with no powdered face
Without exercise you got the eye
Starin' you down, make me wonder why
You women wanna frown at them stick figures
On them little ass girls, when a clique of niggaz run up
And try to hurl game for real, your frame holds appeal in the everyday
World in conceal is not the way to go, I'm tellin' you
I had to let ya know, ya need to let it all hang
Don't be scared to show a little of that thang-thang
No matter how you weigh it girl, it's feminine
Got a body everybody wanna know, yeah yeah
Be the private dancer in my Luke show, c'mon girl
Skip the salad girl, bring us both a menu
Eat the whole box of chocolates I send you, hey
See girl, ya more than just apple in my eye
Confess I wanna get up in ya thighs
Downs, the rest'll tell you all the things
Don't stuck on the things they say, now you know it's a nasty world
Tryna get witcha anyway 'cuz I know your a nasty girl
We's never gon' discriminate so lemme compliment your size
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I love it when y'all broads wear it skintight, skintight
Make the big panties look like little panties, hey
Tryin' to lose that bottom girl you been right
I saw who make ya cookies I should go and thank ya granny, uh huh
Don't mind you being conscious of ya calories
If gettin' paper stack man you'd get salaries
You ain't in this alone I got a tummy to
Just lemme watch the weight, don't let it trouble you, come here girl
Nine ten specimen up in ya jeans
You 'bout a size seven and just make it fit
Slim Fast, lypo and body creams
I'll put you on the dogs I got a candle lit
Don't stuck on the things they say, now you know it's a nasty world
Tryna get witcha anyway 'cuz I know your a nasty girl
We's never gon' discriminate so lemme compliment your size
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Don't stuck on the things they say, now you know it's a nasty world
Tryna get witcha anyway 'cuz I know your a nasty girl
We's never gon' discriminate so lemme compliment your size
