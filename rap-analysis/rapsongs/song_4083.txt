Chris Br-eezy I ... see ya da-da 
Ya, right off the bat 
I'm a mack 
We can get it poppin, we can get it crack-in' 
And if your man is whack 
And if he lack what I pack 
Then Imma make you lack him 
Shorty we can do what you wanna, how you wanna 
Where you wanna, when you wanna - ask them 
And my clip never droppin' 
We can get it poppin' like a mac-ten 
Brrrr-Dat Dat Dat on your back back back 
I smack smack smack that 
And I'm strapped with an automatic tongue 
And it goes Brrrr-At-Dat Dat Dat 
Now who wanna get shot baby I could tap that 
Yup I could tap that (atta?) Rat Pack 
I could lay back like a fat cat 
But I'm a big dog on Inter-track 
Ah- and we can get it poppin' e'ry night e'ry night 
When we do tha tour thing 
You know I had to tell them young niggaz 
When it come to the women I just switch like a mood ring 
But I'm rich, I'm high on the food chain 
I'm hot, I smoke like two trains 
I'm trained, I know how to do things 
My thing - hot like blue flame 
Flame- the fireman put it out 
She hot- the fireman put her out 
All she gotta do is call up emergency 
And I will be on my way to the house 
knock,knock? I know somebody home 
Don't leave me knocking' baby 
All you gotta do is bring that car 
And we can get it poppin' baby.
