What's on y'all, niggaz minds
Fuckin' wit' me, y'all know
Somebody has told you about fuckin' wit' D
Stuck in a tree is what you will be?
Like a cat and I'm the dog at the bottom
Lookin' up what's that
Your worst nightmare is I take it right there
You got niggaz comin' where they at, right where?
I make 'em like air, floatin' away
Wouldn't tell what he was thinkin' so I opened a way
Went from broken away, you know he hurt before he died
Makes you wonder if he lost his shirt before he died
Only two knew the answer and one of us is dead
So anyone who seeks the truth can get it straight to head
Than you and him can discuss what I did
Yeah it was wrong dog but I slid
I'll repent one day, just not right
Now, you hear my shit all on the street
I'm kinda hot right now
Come on
I don't give a fuck about
Ch'yall niggaz 'cause y'all
Ain't killin' nuttin'
I don't give a fuck about
Ch'yall niggaz 'cause y'all
Ain't killin' nuttin'
I wanna break bread wit' da' Katz that I starve with
Wanna hit the malls with the same dogz I rob wit'
Wanna be able to laugh with the niggaz that I cried with
When it's over be like these is tha niggaz that I died wit'
What do you do when you find out in the hall, there's a rat
What do you do when you find out that your dog is a cat shit
On niggaz back, can't hold but two
So while you gettin' more gatz I'm puttin' wholes in you
Snub nose will do, break 'em off real
Proppa', need to keep it' spittin' but
I ain't gonna stop pa', cocka, unlocka, let 'em go
Give it to his man just to let him know
All things considered it was real for' a minute
Got what was yourz and tried to steal sometin' wit it
Now feel sometin' hit it, your chest that is
The best that is, is probably the best that slid
Yo stress that kid
I don't give a fuck about
Ch'yall niggaz 'cause y'all
Ain't killin' nuttin'
I don't give a fuck about
Ch'yall niggaz 'cause y'all
Ain't killin' nuttin'
When niggaz hear that dog bark they betta run
When police hear that dog bark they betta come
They expect tha same thing that's live
And they lives will be lost
There is a price to pay, how many lives will be lost
Since I run with the Devil, I'm one with the Devil
And I stay doin' dirt so I'm gonna come with the shovel
Hit chyou on a level of a madman who's mind's twisted
Made niggaz dreams caught the last train mines missed it
Listed as a manic depressin' with extreme paranoya
And dog I got sometin' for ya
Hear my name, feel my pain
Niggaz wanna steal my fame, but first feel
My reign, know what it's like to suffer
Never have enough of shit, startin' off hard than
Only gettin' rougher, tougher
But than came the greese, so if you wanna say peace
Tame the beast
