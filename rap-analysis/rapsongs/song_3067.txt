It's on like Donkey Kong
You wanted that fast buck
now I gotta light that ass up
The nigga with the big fat trigger
Don't test me, gravedigger had the swig
of the ST, remember the time we first met her
You threw your set up now you gotta get wetter
BOOM! PING! BUCK! POW!
Now who's that nigga with the diff'rent style?
Uhh, ya wanted ta trick
It's all about the pud and who can empty it
First mate, they made day AK
and I'll Kurtis Blow ya ass away like AJ
I'm almost certain I'm put on the hurtin
Bitch, it's curtains!
Locced in my motherfuckin head
Gotta play connect-the-dots with my infrared
You in danger, Mr Gangbanger
It ain't cool to take nappy from a stranger
Wit'cha drive-by's it took time to catch ya
but now I gotta wet'cha
Chorus:
Now I gotta wet'cha (wet'cha)
Now I gotta wet'cha (wet'cha)
I'm comin ta get'cha (get'cha)
You better hope I don't catch ya (catch ya)
(You're all wet) The nigga with the big fat trigger
(You're all wet) The nigga with the big fat trigger
S-I-M-I
Valley for the KKK, Rodney!
A place on the map where the order is
though devils can't leap up a motorist
and get nothin but a slap on the wrist
Gorillas, gorillas report
