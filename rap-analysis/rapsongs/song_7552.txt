Ay, ay, but you gotta believe, but you gotta believe
Ay, ay, but you gotta believe, but you gotta believe, let's get it
I used to hit the kitchen lights cockroaches everywhere
Hit the kitchen lights now it's marble floors everywhere
Call the carpenter the roof on the coups gone
Give a fuck what he sold I'm the truth holms
Kitchen fumed up, niggas jamming 2Pac
Get my Billy Hondas on working two pots
Baby need shoes partner need bail money
Blood hound for the bread I just smell money
You niggas just write I recollect
Hands on Jeezy really counted them checks
I'm Donald Trump in a white tee and white ones
The conversation is money nigga, you want some?
Ay, ay, ay but you gotta believe, ay, but you gotta believe
Ay, you ain't never seen them pies
I'm talking so much white it'll hurt your eyes
I really lived it man counting so much paper
It'll hurt your hands, let's get it
I'm what the streets made me a product of my environment
So what the streets gave me, product of my environment
Now its 28 inches on a brand new hummer
Telling you right now it's gone be a cold summer
Blew the brains out the Chevy call it suicide
It's a way of life that's how us young niggas ride
Trap or die gave 'em hope they waiting on the sequel
It's clear to see the boy Jeezy do it for the people
Ay, ay, ay but you gotta believe, ay, but you gotta believe
Ay, you ain't never seen them pies
I'm talking so much white it'll hurt your eyes
I really lived it man counting so much paper
It'll hurt your hands, let's get it
I'm the author of the book, yeah a genius wrote it
There's a message in my words you gotta decode it
I seen it all every gram every bird
I spit the truth every noun every verb
I never exaggerated one line one time
Never lied to the people not one time
A hard head make a soft ass, ay
And hard white it get you straight cash
Ay, ay, ay but you gotta believe, ay, but you gotta believe
Ay, you ain't never seen them pies
I'm talking so much white it'll hurt your eyes
I really lived it man counting so much paper
It'll hurt your hands
