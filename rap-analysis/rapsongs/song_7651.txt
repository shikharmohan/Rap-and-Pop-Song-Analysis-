Tryin' to get Boston George and Diego money
Stack it all up like Lego money
Played with them blocks, call it Tetris
Real talk a hundred carats in my necklace
Look up in the sky and tell me what you see
The clouds, no nigga, not me
I see opportunity, I'm a opportunist
Nigga, you heard what I said, "I'm a opportunist"
Soft to hard, white to green
All these free agents, you better build your team
I come to take the game like John Madden
'Cause I played in the game like John Madden
The world is yours and everything in it
It's out there, get on your grind and get it, ay
Hands in the air, sky's the limit, nigga, hands in the air, yeah
The world is yours and every bitch in it
It's out there, get on your grind and get it, ay
Hands in the air, sky's the limit, nigga, hands in the air, yeah
Do anything you put your mind to, put your grind to
Forgetful ass, nigga, must I remind you
Men do what they want, boys do what they can
And it ain't no secret, I'm a grown ass man
With my hands on the Bible and I solemnly swear
Leave the mall with more shoes than I can possibly wear
Niggas still hatin' but they can kiss my ass
Still get a hard on when I count that cash
I give 'em the squares, he give me the bag
I give 'em the squares, he give me the cash
And that's what the fuck a call an' even exchange
And if there's anything extra, you can keep the change
The world is yours and everything in it
It's out there, get on your grind and get it, ay
Hands in the air, sky's the limit, nigga, hands in the air, yeah
The world is yours and every bitch in it
It's out there, get on your grind and get it, ay
Hands in the air, sky's the limit, nigga, hands in the air, yeah
Grind sundown 'til it comes up again
Stay down 'til we come back up again
It's all in the game, the ups, the downs
It's all in the game, the O's, the pounds
The shit was all good just a week ago
Whole click was eatin' good just a week ago
It's all good, nigga, give us a month
Thinking of a master plan while I smoke this blunt
Went to Houston and back now, everybody got coupes
Put the word in the street that supply the troops
I just call 'em how I see 'em
Serve these niggas third person, dog, I ain't tryin' to see 'em
The world is yours and everything in it
It's out there, get on your grind and get it, ay
Hands in the air, sky's the limit, nigga, hands in the air, yeah
The world is yours and every bitch in it
It's out there, get on your grind and get it, ay
Hands in the air, sky's the limit, nigga, hands in the air, yeah
The world is yours and everything in it
It's out there, get on your grind and get it, ay
Hands in the air, sky's the limit, nigga, hands in the air, yeah
The world is yours and every bitch in it
It's out there, get on your grind and get it, ay
Hands in the air, sky's the limit, nigga, hands in the air, yeah
