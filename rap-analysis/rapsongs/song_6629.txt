Ridin' in my Chevy and I'm sittin' at the light, at the light
I got *** in my blood, sippin' Remy
Keep it pimpin' with my pinky off the curtain
All the people when they see me like, Snoop turn it up
When I'm ridin' in my Chevy and I'm sittin' at the light, at the light
I got *** in my blood, sippin' Remy
Keep it pimpin' with my pinky off the curtain
All the people when they see me like, Snoop turn it up
I'm in my zone ***
Get stuck in the ribs by old bone crusher
2 tone leather with a soul of a hustler
Tryna stack mail, stealin' clothes from my brother
People wanna know am I close to my mother
I'm a premature baby, I'm ahead of the others
Yes, I'm aware of the gutter
Ahead of my time, the games gettin' smothered
I stay on the grind but it's only gettin' rougher
*** think I'm playin' 'til they smokin' like a muffler
'Bout to take flight and land, open on you bustas
Catch me if you can in a world full of suckas
*** keep sinfin', they wanna be usher
Until they get they eyes and coffin closed by the usher
Them punches won't work, you need more muster
Lord, lay 'em down, he need no sufferin', ***
When I'm ridin' in my Chevy and I'm sittin' at the light, at the light
I got *** in my blood, sippin' Remy
Keep it pimpin' with my pinky off the curtain
All the people when they see me like, Snoop turn it up
When I'm ridin' in my Chevy and I'm sittin' at the light, at the light
I got *** in my blood, sippin' Remy
Keep it pimpin' with my pinky off the curtain
All the people when they see me like, Snoop turn it up
Hmm, on my road to riches
I done seen a lot of roaches and ***
That's why the Dogg keep goin' the distance
But *** don't know when to listen
That's why ***
And stay in touch with my competition
I'm in touch with my composition
Roll a ***, it's the ***, yeah, we got prescriptions
Just a G 5, no aggressions
Pick a side, yeah, you know we ***
And through my eyes I see the world different
A hundred G's to record with 'em
Hit the gas, get me more engine
This is somethin' that was born in 'em
No game for a *** just forfeit 'em
I'm in tune gimme more rhythm
I let the *** and the swords hit 'em
Aw, please like a force emblem
Now make dead with the mortician
***, it's big Snoop Dogg
Ya best to listen, ya heard me?
When I'm ridin' in my Chevy and I'm sittin' at the light, at the light
I got *** in my blood, sippin' Remy
Keep it pimpin' with my pinky off the curtain
All the people when they see me like, Snoop turn it up
When I'm ridin' in my Chevy and I'm sittin' at the light, at the light
I got *** in my blood, sippin' Remy
Keep it pimpin' with my pinky off the curtain
All the people when they see me like, Snoop turn it up
