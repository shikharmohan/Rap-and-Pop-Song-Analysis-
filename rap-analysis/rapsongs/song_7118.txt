What is it we wanna do?
Now that I'm allowed to be alone with you
Birthday Girl its your birthday
Wherever you wanna go 
Now you are old enough to go and see the R-rated show now
R-rated show 
[Black Thought]
Yo, She said she was a magazine editor named Jenning 
Backstage in high heels and painted on jeans 
Probably had the most devious eyes I'd ever seen
Told me she was twenty-two she was only seventeen
She had sumthin' to hide she snuck in from outside 
And got everybody gassed like the car I drive
With all that grown lady ass and my for rap vibe
She said she came to see them roots boy fallout live
But listen,
[Chorus]
Verse 2 [Black Thought]
You see the girls look good but they brains not ready 
I talk to a woman, he mind more steady 
Probably something in the way they designed just more steady
I just let you recite cause the line so heavy
But I shoulda known better cause now I feel like America's underbelly 
R. Kelly got a smart better less, internet predators, chat-room irregulars
This not my twist 
You trying to send me to the therapist 
[Chorus]
Verse 3: [Black Thought]
Now she told me cheddar cheese grits  
Two tomato fried fish 
Cause she heard its my dish
Tryna be my sidekick 
All the people all around thinking she was my chick 
Saying DAMN the girl thick 
But she aint no twenty-six
Looking at me like am up to sumthin' on the funny tip 
Like I ever been the one to honey jib
Its your birthday so let me know the gift you wanna get 
In fact blow out the candles on the cake and make a wish for me

They can't really seem to look away 
So they tried asking her to stay
Fake I.D. you won't get turned away
You look lovely tonight
Now you are old enough to buy a gun 
So many better ways of having fun 
Right now I can only think of one
You look lovely tonight. 
[Chorus]
