Gimme that funk, funk
Yo, gimme that Funk
Sho' nuff that funk
Yo, yo, beware of the dogs, off the chain
*** Your whips at the club, we piss in the parkin' lanes
Blow it up ten frames, so you see it wide
If your broad ain't *** she don't need to ride
She can crawl in the trunk with her knees inside
By the spare, she hungry I'll feed her fries
'Cause I'ma dog *** shot call ***
My shotgun talk with a lecture hall scripture
Applaud *** shake that ***
I getcha drunk and high and duct tape that *** fast
Then leave you on your daddy front lawn
With your hair all *** up, with one pump on
Get stomped on, I take the money and run
I'm a dog, *** right in front of your son
If you ain't got Missy and Meth
Want me to spit the hot *** for you? *** write your check
When you come home from work, I'm gon' make you do more work
Pour some wine in the cup, sip sippin' on sizzurp
Now we gon' make love to and in ya
Slide, wanna take a ride
When you with me, oh, so right, tell them boys not tonight
Say you chillin' with your *** and this is one y'don't wanna miss
'Cause this love right here is on fire
Slide, wanna take a ride
I love it, boy, when you play this song
Dead wrong, you know this record be turnin' me on
You keep me growlin' like a dog in heat
Hey wodie, put it down, make me sleep for weeks
I love it, boy, when you play this song
Dead wrong, you know this record be turnin' me on
You keep me growlin' like a dog in heat
Hey wodie, put it down, make me sleep for weeks
You on the block layin' low, from the cops layin' low
When you done let me know 'cause my love make you be like whoa
'Cause I got your mind in the trenches
Slide, let's take a ride
Baby, come give me some, hey wodie, ain't no other one
Can shine on my life and make me wanna stay the night
'Cause you put butterflies in my stomach
Slide, baby, won't you slide?
I love it, boy, when you play this song
Dead wrong, you know this record be turnin' me on
You keep me growlin' like a dog in heat
Hey wodie, put it down, make me sleep for weeks
I love it, boy, when you play this song
Dead wrong, you know this record be turnin' me on
You keep me growlin' like a dog in heat
Hey wodie, put it down, make me sleep for weeks
Yo, yo, I wanna Gangsta Boogie with my gangsta ***
Love it when the *** talk back thanks to ***
All my dogs playin' the wall, get at these broads
You ain't got no *** at all, we ain't *** wit y'all
I'm not your smooth lovin', see me at Casbah thuggin'
Hands where your Stove Top be stuffin'
Never catch Tical handcuffin', I'm in your party puffin'
Smellin' like that Wu-Tang production
Cousin tried to tell me *** come a dime a dozen
And when it come around, I'll beat it down like percussion
Missy, come and get me, I'm 'bout to call Doc
We can all meet up at Peanut's, I heard it was the spot
Somebody roll up the, push the car lighter
Kick your feet up Saturday Night, who got the Fever?
Brought the flavor of Indonesia
Puff, puff, give type procedures
And this joint bumpin' out your speakers
I love it, boy, when you play this song
Dead wrong, you know this record be turnin' me on
You keep me growlin' like a dog in heat
Hey wodie, put it down, make me sleep for weeks
I love it, boy, when you play this song
Dead wrong, you know this record be turnin' me on
You keep me growlin' like a dog in heat
Hey wodie, put it down, make me sleep for weeks
I'm gonna take you high to the top
And let your body not reject me, babe
I'm gon' make you really love me
I'm gonna make you scream don't stop
But you must first respect his lady
You must respect this lady
