Yeah, smokin', dopin', keep your ears open
Put me on the flier and I'm guaranteed to rope in
Twenty-thousand people to the place that I play at
And have 'em even sayin' how could someone say that?
They're as good as the man who just saw
Please give me some more of those hoopin'
Scoopin', rhymes you be troopin' if you don't know
The new dance, Patti Duke 'n clap your hands
Stomp your feet, snap your fingers
I'm snatchin' airplay from all you, AIDS catchin' singers
It's a special delivery on your front step
My picture's on the cover and the rhymes are in effect
'Cause I love to lay down joints for the playground
And have you od'n sayin', y'know, J sound
Righteous, the brother did what he had to
I didn't talk about this, so I had you
Sleepin', breathin' sayin', yo, he ain't keepin'
His promise to astonish, from weekend to weekend
But here it is, the jam of all jams
And from this day forth MC's are gettin' slammed with the
Uhh, aww yeah, uhh ahh
Uhh, aww yeah, uhh  ahh
Uhh, aww yeah, uhh  ahh
Uhh, aww yeah
I'm the wise wizard of the microphone, swingin' it
Here's a mean joint, all the hip-hoppers are singin' it
Doin' a dance in tight bike pants
So get up on it , hoe, you'll only get one chance
To work out, the soreness in your muscles
Do your own thing, even the hustle
MC's I'ma torture, that's already known
But while I'm torturin' them, I'ma leave you alone
So you can bump, grind, and rub up against your partner
And look wild like you're tryin' to get a part in a
Dirty movie on the hip-hop tip
Now tell me
(Tell you what?)
That brother, l ain't tryin' to flip with the
Uhh, aww yeah, uhh  ahh
Uhh, aww yeah, uhh  ahh
Uhh, aww yeah, uhh  ahh
Uhh, aww yeah
Movin', groovin', admit that you've been
Shocked and rocked and I'm on top
And it's been proven, I'm self-reliant, on stage I'm defiant
All those rumors are small things to a giant
I'm not a cool calm, collected type of brother
I'm kind of hype, that's why I'm a good lover
In bed I'm energetic, kind of like a freight train
Goin' so crazy I have the girlies sayin', "Wait, James"
I do, damage use the beef to build a sandwich
And when I'm done, she'll be sayin'
"How did you manage to make me feel pleasure from my toes
To my head?" On top of that, you ran laps around the bed
So bust out the pumped up funk that I'm revealin'
And listen to it, while you're in your car wheelin'
On on your Walkman as you're starin' at the ceilin'
Or when you and your love is sex-appealin' to the
Uhh, aww yeah, uhh  ahh
Uhh, aww yeah, uhh  ahh
Know what I'm sayin'?
Uhh, aww yeah, uhh  ahh
It's like a smooth joint
You know what I mean?
Uhh, aww yeah
Real mellow, on the love tip, check it out
Uhh, aww yeah, uhh ahh
Uhh, aww yeah, uhh ahh
Uhh, aww yeah, uhh ahh
Uhh, aww yeah
Marvelous
