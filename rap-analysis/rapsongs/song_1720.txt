A little high belongs to you
Yeah, getting high off the soup
(Drink it up)
A little high belongs to me
Top rhyming's how we're coming with the loop
(Sip it down)
A little high belongs to you
A dab of this, dab of that, not too heavy on the garlic
(Take it easy)
A little high belongs to me
With just a touch of oregano
Now everybody's funking but they don't know how
They wasn't down back when the bull funked the cow
But the chest of the cow was vestless
So the stank from the D-thang bang left the breathless
Oregano flow
Don't waste your time sticking out your chest, for no
Reason, it's the season for the lovely flow
The 'D', we're sick enough of stress, let it go
Now follow as I slip into the butter melody
This is the part I take your heart and leave your vision blurry
So try to focus on my dope
And I suggest you invest in a telescope
As I'm kicking hella rhythm, move closer to your television
Catch a look just like a hooker catch j-izm
Even with bifocals for your ears, you still couldn't see me though
As I flavor up this vide' like oregano
Slinging them nouns and verbs
You couldn't see me with binoculars
I guess I'm kind of different 'cause I do love them hoes
Only not the same way that I love my niggaroes
'Cause I love it when they say something fly
The ill caps make me laugh till I cry
Some fries and some freaks and it's on, all night long
I love to see my homies living strong
But that cook with the cloudy cookbook
Rained salt on another brother's sunny day
I wonder are we really happy here
With this lonely G game we play
A little high belongs to you
Yeah, getting high off the soup
(Drink it up)
A little high belongs to me
Top rhyming's how we're coming with the loop
(Sip it down)
A little high belongs to you
A dab of this, dab of that, not too heavy on the garlic
(Take it easy)
A little high belongs to me
With just a touch of oregano
Now everybody's looking but they cannot see
The 'D' because we're future and we're too slippery
You know we're coming with oregano flow
Don't waste your time sticking out your chest, for no
Reason it's the season for the lovely flow
The 'D', we're sipping off the stress, let it go, let it go
Top rhyming's how we're coming with the loops
Oregano, baby, oregano
A little high belongs to you
Yeah, my soup'll get you high
(Drink it up)
A little high belongs to me
Top rhyming's how we're coming, bye-bye
A little high belongs to you
A little high belongs to me
