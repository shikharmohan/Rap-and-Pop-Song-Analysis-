Roawrrr, roawrrr
'Til my dragon baby stop whinin'
I see my influence still
Roawrrr, roawrrr
'Til my dragon baby stop whinin'
I see my influence still
Roawrrr, roawrrr
'Til my dragon baby stop whinin'
I see my influence still shinin'
Hit you with my ultra violence
Skin cancer causin' laser beam flow, then causin' riot
Oh shit, I'm gon' give you more an' more flows
That's gon' help you see who got the real raw
You can watch me wreck for the entire nine seasons
Cold-blooded flow that got you motherfuckers freezin'
You must find your style
Identify with your own profile
Niggaz don't understand what we be talkin' about
Designed especially for biters who try to figure it out
Ice Capades all over beats, son
While I smoke your Phillies all the way down to the last one
Yo, watch me skyrocket
Prop me for my flow, then get your hand out my pocket
As the world keeps on turnin
Killin' microphones as the nigga most determined
Keepin' biters fiendin' like this was they last servin'
Stay away from fake motherfucks like Mark Fuhrman
Got your whole entire 'Little house on the Prairie' burnin'
Stick me for my rhyme like you stuck me for my Sherlings
Yo, you must be out your fuckin' mind
The only thing you really need to do is chill
An' watch the sun shine
Roawrrr, roawrrr
'Til my dragon baby stop whinin'
I see my influence still shinin'
Hey, get with this here roll call
Keep my peoples movin' like a U Haul
Then I'm gonna hit you wit that
Shit that's sure to make your dome crack
Watch me knock you down
You'll be surprised how quick the fuckin' word will get around
A biter came up missin'
An' the bitch was never found, yo
I come with shit, so sure, to hit
Hit you 'til your motherfuckin' dome split
Counterfeit niggaz need to sit back up off of it
An' if you don't listen, you deserve whatever you get
Just a moment, let me take a breather
Got you niggaz sweatin' coal, like you caught the fever
Just to know my every move, you fuck a freak psychic reader
For those who bite my flows, I got to always pack my heater
Yo, I was the one that made a nigga cough
Soft, wait quick to turn a nigga off
Yo, I'm quick to break a niggaz spine
An' any effort made by those who try to take mine
Roawrrr, roawrrr
'Til my dragon baby stop whinin'
I see my influence still shinin'
Roawrrr, roawrrr
'Til my dragon baby stop whinin'
I see my influence still
Roawrrr, roawrrr
'Til my dragon baby stop whinin'
I see my influence still
Roawrrr, roawrrr
'Til my dragon baby stop whinin'
I see my influence still shinin'
