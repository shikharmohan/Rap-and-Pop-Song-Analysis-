[Lil Wayne]
Yeah, I should never leave hip-hop
Controlled by my two hands they go tik-tok
Around the clock, yes it's my time, my throne
Better know the time of day in any f*ckin time zone
I'm feeling like I'm on top of the rhinestone
Pullin' the ladder from heaven, about to climb home
Mental thoughts are sharper than the pinecone
In this world of numbers I keep my nine though
And I don't go to church because the lying low
And the preacher, he be gettin' his shine on
But I Know my lord, I am God's own
banks on my hands, tick tick, a time bomb
[Jay Sean]
Yeah, don't you know I'll be (I'll be)
Yeah, don't you know I'll be (I'll be)
I'll be here cause I won't quit yeah
you can try lock me up
you can try break me down
but I stay strong
It's my throne
Can't stop now cuz that ain't me
