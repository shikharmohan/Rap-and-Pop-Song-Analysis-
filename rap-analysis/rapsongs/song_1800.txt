If I'm gonna rob I'ma rob all night
If I'm lookin' for somethin' then it's prob'ly a fight
If I'm gonna fuck bitches then they better be tight
If that's dead then the head better be right
If I'm gonna rob I'ma rob all night
If I'm lookin' for somethin' then it's prob'ly a fight
If I'm gonna fuck bitches then they better be tight
If that's dead then the head better be right
Here we go again fuckin' right
Dog man X baby dog for life
Know how this shit go? Built off fights
Bitch dog be like aigh aigh aigh
This rap shit be gettin' kinda hectic
It's not a game nigga cats don't respect it
Real shit's been neglected for far too long
Let's get it on
I jump off slugs like packages from UPS
But you run when you see X
Pull out the front when you see Tex
The light is what you see next
Fuck who you listenin' to I'm the badest
Ninety eight percentage of the industry is faggots
Stewart little niggaz don't want no static
When they say, "Who shot J R? It won't be Dalas"
If I'm gonna rob I'ma rob all night
If I'm lookin' for somethin' then it's prob'ly a fight
If I'm gonna fuck bitches then they better be tight
If that's dead then the head better be right
If I'm gonna rob I'ma rob all night
If I'm lookin' for somethin' then it's prob'ly a fight
If I'm gonna fuck bitches then they better be tight
If that's dead then the head better be right
You all niggaz don't know how the dog livin'
No matter what I do I keep on winnin'
Can't stop me now it's just the beginnin', be'nin'
Gonna be there till the endin', endin'
In 2005 you don't know
Stop drop open up shot let 'em go
Hit 'em with the same flow I hit 'em with before
This time I'm goin' around the back door
Got me like God you niggaz is stupid
Get the drum crack four bars horn then loop it
Same shit that you did to me took what you did?
Got niggaz movin' but not institution
Dog done did it again
Dog is in it to win
Dog did a nigga and then
You thought dog was afraid?
If I'm gonna rob I'ma rob all night
If I'm lookin' for somethin' then it's prob'ly a fight
If I'm gonna fuck bitches then they better be tight
If that's dead then the head better be right
If I'm gonna rob I'ma rob all night
If I'm lookin' for somethin' then it's prob'ly a fight
If I'm gonna fuck bitches then they better be tight
If that's dead then the head better be right
My niggaz some niggaz that you don't wanna try
But then again I be that one to bust a nigga in his eye
I don't give a fuck bitch all my niggaz ready to die
Hit you with the things so you niggaz ready to fly not
You don't want no more
Bring all you got to even the score
E5 is hot? You want more?
You really don't know what you're askin' for
Listen old man don't do that
We all dogs over here don't act like a cat
We like touch balls round table with a bat
Start with the cheers crack crack crack
If I'm gonna rob I'ma rob all night
If I'm lookin' for somethin' then it's prob'ly a fight
If I'm gonna fuck bitches then they better be tight
If that's dead then the head better be right
If I'm gonna rob I'ma rob all night
If I'm lookin' for somethin' then it's prob'ly a fight
If I'm gonna fuck bitches then they better be tight
If that's dead then the head better be right
If I'm gonna rob I'ma rob all night
If I'm lookin' for somethin' then it's prob'ly a fight
If I'm gonna fuck bitches then they better be tight
If that's dead then the head better be right
If I'm gonna rob I'ma rob all night
If I'm lookin' for somethin' then it's prob'ly a fight
If I'm gonna fuck bitches then they better be tight
If that's dead then the head better be right
