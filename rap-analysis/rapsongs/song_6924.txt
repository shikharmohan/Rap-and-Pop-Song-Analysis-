Tajai:
Yo, the jam was fly
Oh my, now it's over
My batch of pals cut so tajai must catch a taxicab
Dag nab
Why'd they leave me? 
Stuck in the late night alley
I'm, not so hype that everyone should be sweatin'
Yet nobody's smilin'
Plus crews are pilin'
Starin'
Thinkin' what they'd look like wearin'
My gear
A sigh when the yellow cab neared
It sped up, 'cause dreds made him think I'd vic him
Now I gotta dodge thugs like I'm playin' chicken
An englishman, an irishman, 5 or 10 caucasians passed me
In their taxis
Oh no such luck
I'm gonna get bucked
For my apparel
As I seen a black guage barrel
Just then a fat cab came to my rescue
Damn I'm glad black men drive them cabs too
Opio:
It seems nowadays cab rides are rather pricely
Especially when the driver goes for self
In spite of the directions that are given
They are driven
To cruise backstreets
That treats
Them to a pricely fair, exactly
What happened to myself when I chose to call a taxi
It pulled up to the curb and I hopped into the backseat
Gave him the destination, said he'd never heard of the place
And I'd have to tell him as we went along, and then placed it in drive
When I said make a left he made a right
Alright
I get it, you wanna make some slight
Detours
So you can be sure
That you get yours
And when I turn my head you up the bill a little more
I told the cabbie to stop, he didn't think I watched it
Fake reached into my pocket
And then jetted like I was rocket
Ishmael
His tail light was broken
As a token
Of appreciation, he started chasin' but I smoked him
Phesto:
What?  you can't escape me
Mop head
Drop dead, deceased
Say your final summons if I catch ya
Bet ya
Regret ya
Ever ditched me
Drivin'
Connivin'
Guys been
Robbin' me lately
He went up lake st.
But I'm followin'
Swallowin'
Up steps
He ran to the left, I made a left and crashed
Into a rose bush
My nose crushed
On impact
But yo, I'll get him back
A-plus:
Ha, I didn't have enough for a car, what a bummer
I had to get a job drivin' taxis last summer
All the other drivers knew that my car was spectacula'
'cause I had a tight, very bright yellow acura
Pilin' in 9 or 10 skins at a time, g
Funny how the honeys with the money always find me
Payin' their green to see what color my house is
Feelin' like del 'cause they would sleep on my couches
I'd charge senior citizens extra, 'cause they never mention
I'd take all the money from they pension
And I'd drive a blind man around for a while
Even if he only had to travel just a mile
With a smile
And don't let your dog off the leash
'cause if he stepped then I would have to squash the beast
And if you didn't have the right change, don't even ask me
Or else I woulda' ran ya ass down wit' my taxi
