Now, where the ladies at? Yo, we're chillin' over here
And all the fellas, the fellas? Takin' over this year
I heard the party's round here, right? You know that's right
Dinninit, yo, hey, hey, hey
Now, where the ladies at? Yo, we're chillin' over here
And all the fellas, the fellas? Takin' over this year
I heard the party's round here, right? You know that's right
Dinninit, yo, hey, hey, hey
Dinninit, yo, hey, hey, hey
Dinninit, yo, hey, hey, hey
Dinninit, yo, hey, hey, hey
Dinninit, yo, hey, hey, hey
It's so real when we come through
Sunshine be on my sidewalk when I come through
Schoolly D like family reunions, midday may, it's all lovin'
Take a walk down to D dot C
The war's tuggin' and ain't no druggin', my credit's a gain
While you searchin' for some trick to put the shit in her name
I be spendin on wall street and buyin' boardwalk
Dodging problems of the world, drawn out in white chalk
Peace, Mr. War, I'm seein' all dimensions
But unlike your eye extensions, my vision don't blur
'What', 'When' and 'Word's, where the gossip occur
Heard I'm sexin' sade and I bought her a fur
Battin' eyes at Toni Braxton and I bought her a fur
Now I'm hittin' Whitney Houston, oh, she bought me a fur?
Far-fetched like glass teks and Kiddie Rolex
Soon comin' but now it's time to kick the fun in
Now, where the ladies at? Yo, we're chillin' over here
And all the fellas, fellas? Takin' over this year
I heard the party's round here, right? You know that's right
Dinninit, yo, hey, hey, hey
Now, where the ladies at? Yo, we're chillin' over here
And all the fellas, the fellas? Takin' over this year
I heard the party's round here, right? You know that's right
Dinninit, yo, hey, hey, hey
Dinninit, yo, hey, hey, hey
Dinninit, yo, hey, hey, hey
Dinninit, yo, hey, hey, hey
Dinninit, yo, hey, hey, hey
I'm pourin' out these rhymes for them kids who ain't here
Stakes is high but we gonna try to have fun this year
Before there were guns, there was native tongues on these plains
But others on without them being pawns in this game
'Cause a pawn in this game is left with no game to play
So, um, you best ta check and hear what we got to say
Now if you came to party just let it be known
Now if you came to fight, you might get that head flown
By the one and only, Maseo Plug Third
J.D. Dove plays the wall as Kenny Cal spurts words
And a number to a crew of dope girls from the woods
And not dope meaning weed but dope meaning
Like them west coast kids who be throwin' up signs
I hate a buster unless his name is Busta Rhymes
So check the way my mind moves over times and grooves
Got some money to blow, wonder why wanna know
Now, where the ladies at? Yo, we're chillin' over here
And all the fellas, the fellas? Takin' over this year
I heard the party's round here, right? You know that's right
Dinninit, yo, hey, hey, hey
Now, where the ladies at? Yo, we're chillin' over here
And all the fellas, the fellas? Takin' over this year
I heard the party's round here, right? You know that's right
Dinninit, yo, hey, hey, hey
Dinninit, yo, hey, hey, hey
Dinninit, yo, hey, hey, hey
Dinninit, yo, hey, hey, hey
