Aight!  Check it out
Word, niggaz smoke too fuckin' much man
We can all get by if we want now
Get a fat piece of the pie if we want
Motherfuckers gettin' mad high when they want now
I will survive, recognize it be Tical
What up our?  Niggas is strapped, ready for war on the ill block
Things just ain't peace no more, fuck it
If you ain't with me then forget me
Niggas try to stick me, retaliation, no hesitation shifty
Creepin' niggaz in the dark, triggas with no heart
Rippin' ass apart, I'll be swimmin' with the sharks now
Stay out my water or it's manslaughter
Kid, you ought a start reachin' for that nickle-plated
Auto-matic my thoughts get sporadic
Loaded raps bustin' mad shots to ya attic
They say this hazard, this flows a hazard
Straight from Hazard County with a bounty on his head
And it said, "Wanted Dead or Alive"
I swear by the whites of they eyes to never take a dive I will survive
We can all get by if we want now
Get a fat piece of the pie if we want
Motherfuckers gettin' mad high when they want now
I will survive, recognize it be Tical
Eeep ock, hip stop, mmm-bar
Here we go star
Shit's gonna happen if niggas start actin'
Like they want problems, you want 'em, you got 'em
Rap contact, is writin' this exactly, the way it should be
Attacked Killer Bees on a swarm
Salaikum Asalaam, drops bombs like Quran
The ism helps to stimulate my pugilism
I bust rhymes like jizm, impregnate the rhythm with the wisdom
Decipher, to see I be hyper
I bring all the style, that rekindle like old flames
Saliva, check the wicked flows I deliva
Oops, I mean delivers like the Hudson River
Styles be tight, trite like a thief in the night
I be the sneaky-ass nigga bustin' nuts in yo wife
Blasted, buggin' off Bacardi and acid
Flippin' on the mic, it's a classic
