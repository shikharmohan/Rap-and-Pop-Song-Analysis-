Absolutely, Flaco
Fresh and I'm fresh and my fresh just get fresher
Diamonds in production glow greater than the pressure
None turn to some and the some turn to more
The more turn to many and the many turn to all
Shouting on my nothing like it's nothing at all
To not knowing what ya got till it got gone
Same song, new time signature
New brand hustle with the long time arithmetic
Bey, from the preacher man, number man, understand
Curves and sliders, overs and under-hands
Black Batman, knock 'em out the park pitch-
quiet, fire sniper not the one you tryna box with
Block work when the block turn jobless
and triple beams ain't the best means to weigh your options
Smarts, get smart with your smartness
Too busy surviving to argue about Darwin, darling
See me, huh, a pretty dancer
Me, Sugar Ray and Ali pretty dancer
See me do it (see me do it)
Ready, steady, step it out
Big swing-swing with bangers and thing-thingers
Soul glow zinging all over the ring finger
Yo-yo, don't play me so close
Make me tell you something that you ain't really ready to know
Fight camp you was in top form
Fight night, damn you ain't breaking popcorn
Aw man word bond? Word is +bond-ultimatum+
Lights off, smelling salts resuscitate em
I don't underrate 'em son, I don't nothing-rate 'em
All i do is pop-pop, fru-st-rate 'em
Exacerbate 'em, sharp shoot, lacerate 'em
Steady hustle, shuffle-shuffle, fascinate 'em
Ecstatic nature, black imagination activated
True and living elevated, you are rocking with the greatest
Ecstatic nature, black imagination activated
True and living elevated, you are rocking with the greatest
It's like a dove from up above
See me, huh, a pretty dancer
Me, Sugar Ray and Ali pretty dancer
See me do it (see me do it)
Ready, steady, step it out
Fly like a dove from up above
See me, huh, a pretty dancer
Me, Sugar Ray and Ali pretty dancer
See me do it (see me do it)
Ready, steady, step it out
[Repeated until end]
Fly like a dove from up above
[Repeat 4X]
Ecstatic nature, black imagination activated
True and living elevated, rocking with the greatest
Ecstatic nature black imagination activated
True and living elevated, you are rocking with the greatest
