Hand me one of them thangs killed John Wayne
D.E.A. back in this bitch
Fuck around with this nigga Bosko, he stay mobbin'
Shall we spit some saliva? Spit some saliva
In and out of the traffic
Sparkin' up a bunch of commotion and static it's a habit
Bloated, wasted, loaded, tilted when I roll it
Like the steering wheel on my Deville when I first drove it
Who the caviest and the savviest [Incomprehensible]
Strikin' like a pack of matches
Blood alcohol, lookin' like above average
Money tall player, papered up, ghetto fabulous
You can ball too pimpin' just be about your cabbage
I don't need no iron, I'm already creased
Pistol-whip a bitch with my mouthpiece, paid for hoe
On my car, fuckin' lease
Strikin' through your neighborhood, disturbin' peace
Boogie green Cutlass with the gold feets
Same colored tint with the bucket seats, bitch
All my wife I was raised around killers
Boy I tell ya these monkeys don't wanna see no gorillas
(It's like a jungle)
It's like a jungle sometimes
(It's like a jungle)
It's like a jungle sometimes
(It's like a jungle)
You know a sea serpent
Snake in the grass can post up lies
(It's like a jungle)
It's like a jungle sometimes
(It's like a jungle)
It's like a jungle sometimes
(It's like a jungle)
We play for keeps, so nigga
If you feel froggish leap, leap nigga, bitch
Chest splitter, game spitter, go getter
I stay busy like Mighty Joe, the go-rilla
One hitter quitters if you're it, bump my feet nigga
I hit the turf, knockin' off wall pictures
Nowadays niggaz can get arrested
For reckless dressin', attempt to pimp
But they don't know a broke horse
And don't know how money makes a pimp, pimp
See I'm like a pimp, I got to be about means
Twinkied out with a car full of TV screens
I mean I'm mean, I boss up for the green
Hit the scene and check my runners 'bout my cream
One-eighteen, haters wanna cross my dream
Handicap me, shoot me in the spleen
(It's like a jungle)
It's like a jungle sometimes
(It's like a jungle)
It's like a jungle sometimes
(It's like a jungle)
If you see me in a fight in the forest with a bear
Don't help me nigga help the bear
(It's like a jungle)
It's like a jungle sometimes
(It's like a jungle)
It's like a jungle sometimes
(It's like a jungle)
Boy, I tell ya, these monkeys
Don't wanna see no gorillas, see no gorillas
Man potnah you ain't from 'round here, you ain't got no pass
Oh you with 40-water, we can go 'head and let you go
But next time, it's yo' ass
Lick you for yo' cash, get you for what you got
'Cause triflin' on this side of the soil that's all we do is plot
Seen it, lived it, did it, been in it, done it
Cooked it, shucked it, sold it, couple hundred
Units a month, dirty white girl
Baby powder, China white, step-mother pearl
I'm out of weed, I'm losin' my focus
Ash tray full of doobies and roaches
In the parking lot rollin' a blunt, in the middle of some funk
Dudes got to dumpin' bitches, haulin' ass
Takin' off they pumps, fallin' in the grass
Cowards flyin' everywhere, fools gettin' glassed
While I'm sittin' in my cut thang, tryin' to play
They fuckin' up my shit
(It's like a jungle)
It's like a jungle sometimes
(It's like a jungle)
It's like a jungle sometimes
(It's like a jungle)
You know a sea serpent
Snake in the grass can post up lies
(It's like a jungle)
It's like a jungle sometimes
(It's like a jungle)
It's like a jungle sometimes
(It's like a jungle)
We play for keeps, so nigga
If you feel froggish leap, leap nigga, bitch
Be about your paper bro, don't hate on mine
It's like a jungle sometimes
Gorilla pimpin' ain't easy but I'm steady on the grind
It's like a jungle sometimes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
It's like a jungle sometimes, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
It's like a jungle sometimes, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
It's like a jungle sometimes, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
It's like a jungle sometimes
