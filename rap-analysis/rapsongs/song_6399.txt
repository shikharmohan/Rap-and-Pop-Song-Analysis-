Ah shit, I'm sick of niggas jumpin' up with choppers
Runnin' for your shit, tryin' to make another nigga stop ya
But it's on cause you up against a real nigga
I steal niggas and kill niggas, I'm the real nigga
You up against a muthafucka with a quick temper
I'm a born killer, in case you don't remember
I got my pistol but I got a different clip in it
Click-click, muthafuckas, can you get with it?
You ain't the nigga that you thought you was, fool
And now I'm after that ass on the cool
It's all about survival of the fittest
Nigga, you shouldn'ta did this
And now I gots to handle my business
I got to get your ass up out the picture
I ain't the nigga you wanna fuck with
Muthafucka, I wouldn't bullshit ya
Now look at what you stuck with
The last nigga in this muthafuckin' world
You shoulda fucked with, I'm leavin' niggas in bodybags
You shouldn'ta fucked with the Brad
You punk muthafucka, I'm comin' agg
Mr., Mr. Scarface for the nine-trey
Niggas packin' nines, fuck you, bitch, I pack an AK
Fully automatic for you hoes who wanna jack this
S.A. fool, and I'ma put you on your back, bitch
Ain't no half-steppin', I'm comin' at you rough-like
Shootin' to kill 'cause back in school I had enough fights
Whenever when I bucked my knuckles up on a nigga's head
So you can sling em all you want but I be slingin' leg
'Cuz like I said befo' I'm a muthafuckin' dreadlock
Puttin' fools in headlocks, givin' niggas headshots
And everybody in your muthafuckin' area
Is tryin' to scrap up some money, so they can help to bury ya
But I can give a muthafuck about your family
Because your family ain't my fuckin' family
You shoulda thought before you stepped to tha
Nigga in black standin' right here next to ya
I'm stoppin' muthafuckas from breathin'
Just gimme a reason and I'ma be squeezin'
The trigger of this muthafuckin' glock
Pop-pop until you drop, from these muthafuckin' gunshots
And leave your whole fuckin' family sad
Don't fuck with the Brad, muthafucka
'Cuz Brad's comin' agg
Where the cocksuckers at, where the cocksuckers at?
(Where they at? Where they at? There they go)
At my gat
'Cuz I'm about to heat up like a vet
Chop shit down on your set and then jet
And smash off in my soap box
'Cuz I'm down for the dirt
And muthafuckas said it don't stop
Now which one of you hoes wanna fuck
Make your way to your truck
I wanna see the way that you jump
'Cuz by the time you get your keys
I'm lettin' loose, muthafucka,
Lay em down, nigga, and get these
It ain't shit for me to watch em fly
So die, muthafuckas, die, muthafuckas, die, die
I ain't no muthafuckin' good guy, dog
And I don't give a good guy damn about none of y'all
I'm from the state of the muthafuckin' gunslingers
Knockin' dicks in the dirt with just this one finger
So get your ass caught up in this gangsta shit
And I'ma try my best to make it stank, you bitch
Plus you comin' with that fake drag
You fallin' dead on your ass, you muthafucka
I'm comin' agg
