Man I'm gonna do my thang, get up!
It's crazy in the club when I'm in there man, get up!
Trust me homie I'm not playin', get up!
Now get on the dance floor off the chain
I say get up!
I came to bring you that California love
And a lil' New York hatin' it's all of the above
I'm not playin' I'm sayin' I'm off the chain
You niggas better follow the instructions
I said get up!
I ball till I fall
I stunt till I drop
I'm off the show room floor
Not the used car lot
You buy a bottle
I buy the bar
I make every other week feel like Mardi Gras
When I get in to it
I get in to it
Everybody can't do it the way I do it
I make it rain, rain
Till the sun come out
A nigga playin', playin'
We make the guns come out
Now, my question is
Who they gonna blame
When I'm back number one on the Billboard again
Shit, shift now the game done change
Since Mike made Thriller and Prince made Purple Rain
I guess I make the kids wanna slang
And NWA made the West Coast bang
Nah it's just music, man it's just music
Now get your ass on the dance floor and move it
I have the savoir faire
I'm the reason everybody here
I say get up!
I make it hot, I make it hot in here
Your feet hurtin' I really care
I said get up!
I want to see you, I want to see you move
And get all into the groove
I said get up!
I'm getting money man I really don't care
Let me see you put your hands up in the air
I said get up!
Girl, you look good
I want to get to know you better
You look good in them jeans
And them red stilettos
You got a Bentley
Coupe booty baby
I want to drive
See I tell you what mileage is
When I'm inside
I'ma take you for a spin
You know round and round
Switch gears till your love come down
I take you to the point of no return
If you listen you learn
Just how a nigga earn
I got money to burn
While the Gap Band play
She dropped the bomb on me
It's up and down
And up and down
Gracefully
Rick James would have said she a brick house
Or Fifty you should go home to see
What that bitch bout
I found out she like it how I like it, huh
Back it up' get cha some
I know how to get you sprung
Tune you up' use your tongue
Under the hood it's so good
She said it's so good
Goddamn I'm so hood
Nigga wattup?
I have the savoir faire
I'm the reason everybody here
I say get up!
I make it hot, I make it hot in here
Your feet hurtin' I really care
I said get up!
I want to see you, I want to see you move
And get all into the groove
I said get up!
I'm getting money man I really don't care
Let me see you put your hands in the air
I said get up!
And get into it
You are now rocking with the Unit
I said get up!
And get into it
We gonna show you just how we do it
I said get up!
Aftermath, still shady Aftermath
I said get up!
Aftermath, still shady Aftermath
