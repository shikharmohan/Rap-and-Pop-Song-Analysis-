Word up! Y'know whut I'm sayin'
I gotta globe in the world in the mail today
Nah I'm sayin' "Heh, word up!"
Kid told me yo, the world is yours kid, put it in ya pocket
Nah mean, make a brother feel good, word up!
Brother feel energized, I wanna dedicate this one to the game
That put me on the map
I know you love it, the game is so irresistible to touch
You should see me when fienin' for microphones that I fienin' can clutch
Droppin' bombs, combinin' the club attracts
like the Ol' Sugar hill Gang, King Tim and Fatback
There's no question the suggestion was made
The foundation was laid when the Furious played
Grandmaster Flash slayed the competition that was wishin'
They could serve the technician with the number one position
The real deal, Fearless Four scored
Bambataa was hotter, Spoony was givin' em nutta
An' I was all up in my headzone, melody and all
Cosign and the movement sayin' "Yes, yes y'all"
It's just the love affair that never ended
I recommended that I take microphones and blow 'em up
Ain't that splendid this one goes out to all the hip hop do or diers
A song is dedicated to the music I admire
Whenever and ever
We want you, I need you
(I need hip hop)
Whenever and ever
We want you, do you feel the same way too?
(I need hip hop)
Kane's era was terror, he warmed it up
Parrish and Erick cat lyrics that'll make ya turn it up
And I was in the cut, chillin' in my drop-top Benz
With friends, loungin' with my mens, laughin' 'bout all the ends
That I spends, making snaps, pumping Kool G Rap and Biz
Dapper Dan, Dookie wrotes I'm about to show what time it is
At the rooftop, I was with Doug E.Fresh and Slick Rick
'La Di Da Di, Who likes to party?' was the fat shit
I mean I saw this hip hop thing on every level
Chuck D, PE, yes the rhythm and the rebel
I can reminisce the black fist, Uzi, Terminators
Terror doom techniques that terrorise the lighter shade
It's all about the game that we play everyday
Eric B and Rakim flow to such a diff'rent way
I'm lovin' hip hop 'cos it help brothers escape
Let's celebrate our music people before it's too late
Whenever and ever
We want you, I need you
(I need hip hop)
Whenever and ever
We want you, do you feel the same way too?
(I need hip hop)
Survival of the fittest Mobb Deep, and Lost Boyz
Lickin' shots got the game hot
They even flipped on 2PAC
Snoop Doggy Dogg put the West Coast in gear
Dr Dre, NWA, Eazy E's in here
I wanna tell the world they just don't understand
My man Nas Escobar, Wu-Tang Clan
Keith Murray to the Redman, down south Da Brat
My people are you with me where you at? Ya peep that?
I'm on a mission to rejuvenate the funk
Bring the game back and give the do-or-diers what they want
When you hear Craig Mack, Notorious B.I.G.
Latifah, Heavy D, you should reminisce of me
Some say it's Naughty By Nature-'hip-hop in all its glory'
A fleet of battleships floatin' in diff'rent categories
My love affair with hip-hop'll never fade away
Sincerely yours, LL Cool J
Whenever and ever
We want you, I need you
(I need hip hop)
Whenever and ever
We want you, do you feel the same way too?
(I need hip hop)
Yeah, ain't no doubt about it kid, know I'm sayin'
Hip hop's the game, helped a lot of brothers escape
Take it to another level, know I'm sayin'
It's our music, we own this music, know what I'm sayin'
Word life! I wanna give a couple of shoutouts here, know whut I'm sayin'
First of all, I wanna thank my man Baby Chris, y'nah mean?
Helped me put this Mr. Smith Mr.Smith album together
Make it hot, knowI'msayin'
Thank the Track masters Pope Tone, Steve Stout
We definitely turning this joint out, y'nah mean
Word bond! Hip hop for life, kid yeah!
Whenever and ever
We want you, I need you
