Get the burner, uhh, the burner, let loose the cannon
Blood drippin', slippin' off my planet
Man, the panic, funk mode
Mechanical mix flows, competition in my dojo
Swing a hook, got the vertebrae, be brave
Heat gain meltin' on my heatwave
Power to the crowd, pandemonium
Showin' em how I gets down
The life of a killer is scandalous
The life of a killer is dangerous
The life of a killer is scandalous
The life of a killer is dangerous
Triggedy, sky high like a kite
God diggity, every other cloud's blue
Puff on a, yea, puff on a
Bring it on, off, on, baby one two
Peep in the arena, death at your doorstep
Right around the corner is the land of regret
When ya sweat to get down, sweat to get off and on
Till then nothin' normal 'bout my songs
The life of a killer is scandalous
The life of a killer is dangerous
The life of a killer is scandalous
The life of a killer is dangerous
The life of a killer is scandalous
The life of a killer is dangerous
The life of a killer is scandalous
The life of a killer is dangerous
L L cool, J Jazzy jewel
Takin' dime pieces to the real school
I got 'em on nations buckin' like fools
Pit bulls fightin' over streets I rule
Catch it if you can when the hatchet hits your hand
Throw ya skunks in the air, my funk got the flair, man
I can do division, baby I can do math
Multiplying fractions now ya know the half
Knuckle games played, must pack steel
Oh yes, I'm livin' like real
To the highest extent, bloody clothes doin' battle
To the death of my foes, it's my show
The life of a killer is scandalous
The life of a killer is dangerous
The life of a killer is scandalous
The life of a killer is dangerous
The life of a killer is scandalous
The life of a killer is dangerous
The life of a killer is scandalous
The life of a killer is dangerous
