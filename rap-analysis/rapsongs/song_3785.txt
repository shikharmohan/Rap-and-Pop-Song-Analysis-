(Chorus)
Strummin my pain with his fingers 
Singing my life with his words 
Killing me softly with his song 
Killing me softly with his song telling my whole life 
with his words killin me softly with his song
(Verse 1)
I heard he sang a good song 
I heard he had a style 
And so i came to see him and listen for a while 
And there he was this young boy 
a stranger to my eyes
(Chorus)
Strummin my pain with his fingers 
Singin my life with his words 
Killing me softly with his song 
Killing me softly with his song telling my whole life
with his words killin me softly with his song
(Verse 2)
I felt all flushed with fever 
embrarrassed by the crowd 
I felt he found my letters
and read each one out loud 
I prayed that he would finish 
but he just kept right on
(Chorus)
Strummin my pain with his fingers (1 time 1 time)
Singin my life with his words (2 times 2 times) 
killing me softly with his song
Killing softly with his song telling my whole life 
with his words killin me softly with his song
(Hook)
I said whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh la la la whoa oh oh oh oh oh ohla la la,la la la la la la la la whoa oh oh oh la la la la la la la la la la la la la la 
(Chorus)
Strummin my pain with his fingers (yeeeees he was)
Singin my life with his words 
Killing me softly with his song 
Killing me softly with his "SONG" telling my whole life
with his words killin me softly with his song
