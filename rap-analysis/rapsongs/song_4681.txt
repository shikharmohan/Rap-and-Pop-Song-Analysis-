Ah yeah, I wanna send this one
Out to all the jeep lovers worldwide
City to city, ghetto to ghetto
Some flavor for you and yours and your jeep
You're the type of girl that got class and style
Still in all you need the backseat of my jeep once in a while
So I pull up to your door
To give you what you're looking for, hardcore
I know you wanna come in my jeep
We can park on a backstreet
You're checkin' out my car phone, scopin' out my jewelry
Let's do this in a hurry
Air freshener is kickin', drive through for chicken
I know you need a good stickin'
That's when I see my man Snoop
Peace, what up, kid? Loungin' duke
As I turn the corner, starin' in your cornier
You're gettin' hornier and hornier
I'm pumpin' up a blint tape flavor
You're legs is incredible, I do a double take
You're puttin' on your lipstick
I wanna give you this big fat
Quick, I know a place where
We can lounge and cool, don't sleep
(Where at?)
Back seat of my jeep
Back seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode
Back seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode
Back seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode
Back seat of my jeep, let's swing an ep'
I'm pullin' over near your building
I light a candle on the dashboard, we're chillin'
I knew a girl like you would love a scene like this
You got class but deep down you're real freakish
You got it all but you never had a wild episode
That's when me and my jeep showed
Up with the funk in the trunk and hittin' it, we're spunkin'
I'll even get you drunk and tipsy 'cause I know you're feelin' frisky
You love it 'cause it's wild and risky
You got your eyes on the hood, you're up to no good
I took you in the back, you hoped I would
You got your black on black so stacked in the back
While I'm pumpin' in the CD I'll skip a track
Windows are foggy and back seat
Treats in the streets could be a hobby
And you ain't in between the Isley Brothers' sheets
I give it to you real raw in the backseat
That's how you want it, don't ya?
You'll tell your girlfriends, won't ya? Don't lie, take it in your eye
So buckle up, buckle up
What's my name? What's my name?
What's my name? What's my name?
I never knew a four wheel drive could be so live
I'll put your numbers in the archives
So take 'em off and put them things on the mirror, girl
It's my jeep and your world
You got it going on lovely time to do the right thing
'Cause I can tell you wanna swing
Back seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode
Back seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode
Back seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode
Back seat of my jeep, let's swing an ep'
Back seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode
Back seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode
Back seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode
Back seat of my jeep, let's swing an ep'
We're bonin' on the dark blocks
Wearin' out the shocks, wettin' up the dashboard clock
Seats full of sweat, I told ya, I would hit it
Your kitty, kitty, cat, cat was hungry so I fed it
Workin' as a team, somebody, anybody scream
Jump with me to the cash bar
I'll be like Bruce Lee in them skins goin'
Damn, it's so good, the mad grip on my tip
You're still a nice girl but my jeep makes ya flip
You go wild and stick your toes on the roof
You're so cute wit' your gold tooth
Extentions on the carpet
That nice round brown is my target
It's so firm so cushy, it makes me feel mushy
I love it when it's pushy
But don't laugh, I'm serious with this
The back seat of my jeep is priceless
You're climaxin', you're climaxin', it's full action
You love a good waxin', it's so relaxin'
Give me a hug, see what I'm sayin', love?
