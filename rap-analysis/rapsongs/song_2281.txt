[Eazy-E]
Perched up high on a roof top
like a bird I'm havin' evil thoughts
a black hood covers my face
and death flows through my mind at it's own pace
sometimes I feel like a super hero
urgin' to free my kind
I'm so accurate
I shoot ya heart with a dime
now I'm back to the moral of my tale
I see a victim, and then my thoughts fail
my mind is still fumblin' with the present slavery
I'm here to save you but who's to save me
I hold my strap so long that my palms are all wet
I put finger on the button and then the sight'll check
I make the kill here's the deal
after the trigger's pulled then the death is sealed
so as the shots sing out like a piper
everyones scared of a neighborhood sniper
[Chorus]
[Eazy-E]
So my boy is a snitch
I put my gun up to his head 
and simply scared the bitch boo
being the E ya know I'm thinkin' devious thoughts
take off ya clothes nigga and here comes a plot
his bitch was scared she made a move I pulled the trigger
now the room is red
now there's nothing left but the snitch
here's a four leaf clover punk make a wish
one [*Shot*] two [*Shot*] three strikes your out
this nigga is dead and now I'm lookin' for a window to get out
I made my escape the cops chase 
duck into an alley so they don't recognize my face
the boy had to pay the piper
so they all stay in debt of a neighborhood sniper
[Chorus]
[Eazy-E]
I'm Doin' dirt by myself as I continue my mission
killin' all fools as an addiction
as the E lovin' the game leavin the shame
and in my heart I feel no muthafuckin' pain
because my heart is cold as I was told
and with the AK-47 I stand bold
rippin' up shit with the fury of my gun shot
pop pop pow as I watch the muthafucka drop
lovin' the sight as the blood spills
take a photograph, to keep in my hall of thrills I'm stayin' calm
and never hyper as I succeed in my mission
of bein' a neighborhood sniper
[Chorus]
