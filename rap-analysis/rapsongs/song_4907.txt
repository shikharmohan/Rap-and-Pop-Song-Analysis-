I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down, to the down to the to the floor
And I wanna ah-ah, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I got to kn-kn-kn-know what's your fan-ta-sy
I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down to the down to the to the floor
And I wanna uh-uh, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But you gotta let let me know know what's your fanta-ta-sies
You know what I need
Somebody that who can come li-li-lick the clit
And a nigga who ain't thinking 'bout a Trina L P
And I'll make him go and get my shit
We can go from a fly ass jetta to a coupe De Ville
Hotel tally ho or the Beverly hill
A real nigga not the run of the mill
Come and spank me and make me shoot to kill
From the kitchen then you can move me
To the jacuzzi and out the booty
Come and do your duty
Me and fat dick Ludacris making us a movie
Butt naked in a bed of cash
Make tough stuff stutter when I shake my ass
Damn she back, I though she a thing of the past
Cause I'm a bad bitch and I'm off the glass
Having sex in little jets menage'tois
Getting buck wild no matter where we are
Indie 500 in the back of the car
In a dark ass club on the back of a bar
Never want, never ever wanna leave
Work for me like the league overseas
I want a man to fulfill my needs
Keep my body trembling and buckle my knees
I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down to the down to the to the floor
And I wanna ah-ah, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I got to kn-kn-kn-know what's your fan-ta-sy
I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed, down to the down to the to the floor
And I wanna uh-uh, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know what's your fan-ta-sy
I wanna do in the canopy
I wanna do it where your girl gon' see and get mad at me
I want a nigga that'll grab the weave
And turn my eyes Chinese
Tell me baby can you handle me?
I wanna do it all in your mouth
Then I'll pull the ass out
Make you bounce till you pass out
Or we can cut up in the grass
And give the neighbors a flash
Can you tell me who the bad motherfucker now?
Said I wanna take-ta-take-take a nigga back to the crib
And I wanna do all the things, do all the things that I never did
Like I up on the top-to-top-top of the projects getting head
Or you can find me in a dro-drop-drop-drop on dubs in the candy red
I like a nigga when he face down, mouth wide
Polo down with them blades on the ride
Give me a pound with the case on the side
But it's okay I'm gon' break something tonight
Oh see get on your knees
And I'll show you what's my fantasy
Like up in the coupe, coupe
Tell your bitch she ain't gotta be mad at me
I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down to the down to the to the floor
And I wanna ah-ah, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I got to kn-kn-kn-know what's your fan-ta-sy
You gotta li-li-li-lick me from my ass to my clit
Then you gotta su-suck the pussy while I sit on your dick
And I wanna talk some shit while I feel it get stiff
And then ruba-dub on my tits while I nut on your lips nigga
I'm a B K Bitch, love to ride dick
Ass in his face, cock spread out
Nigga uptown, nigga down south
Same ol' shit, foot's in his mouth
F-O-X call me rough sex
Especially when a bitch get right on the X
Get it right on X
Fuck him, check right to the next
Those bitches go right, fox right to the left
Nigga can't fuck, burner on his chest
36 D's, Prada on the breast
Baddest, send him home with na-na on his breath
What? How you think a bitch got my rep?
3 mills, still BK to the death
Still don't give a fuck, still pose naked
Still specialize on sittin' on niggas faces
Pop magnum's by the cases, X5 Benz still spend big faces
Big frown, brown, hold first places, you know what you can do nigga?
You can li-li-li-lick me from my ass to my clit
And ruba-dub up on my tits while I nu-nut on your lips, fucka
I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down to the down to the to the floor
And I wanna ah-ah, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I got to kn-kn-kn-know what's your fan-ta-sy
I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down to the down to the to the floor
And I wanna ah-ah, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I got to kn-kn-kn-know what's your fan-ta-sy
I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down to the down to the to the floor
And I wanna ah-ah, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I got to kn-kn-kn-know what's your fan-ta-sy
I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down to the down to the to the floor
And I wanna uh-uh, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But you gotta let, let me know know what's your fanta-ta-sies
