[Intro- 50 Cent]
Sh Sh...Shady Aftermath HaHa
G G G-Unit! HaHa
[Chorus- Eminem]
Cause we came here to set this party off right 
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side
Cause I don't ever wanna leave the game
Without atleast sayin good-bye
So all my people on my left
All my people on the right swing one last time
Get ya ass up for the doctor
One more time get ya ass up for the doctor
Come on now here we go cliff hanger
It's another club banger got ya hangin on the edge of ya seat
Get on down
[Verse 1]
[Dr. Dre]
Time's up game's over you lose I win
Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yea new year next phase begin
Look who's got you goin crazy again
I'm a trend I set one everytime I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means you're somethin that we already had
But once you're gone you don't come back
[Eminem]
Too bad you're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind you slip we out grind you
You walk around mad you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin and moanin, whinin and bitchin
Sittin observed, listen you'll learn if you pay attention
While 10 multi-platinum albums lay the three diamond
World wide we on the charts with a bullet we're still flyin
[Chorus- Eminem]
Cause we came here to set this party off right 
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side
Cause I don't ever wanna leave the game
Without atleast sayin good-bye
So all my people on my left
All my people on my right swing one last time
When Dr. Dre says crunk you will get it crunk
Get it crunk (Crunk crunk crunk)
And when 50 Cent says jump
You get on one foot and
 
50 Cent:
Jump, jump 
Eminem:
Jump, jump
[Verse 2]
[Dr. Dre]
The buzz is tremendous we drop you all just sense it
I don't gotta promote it for you to know the Doc is off the benches
[Eminem]
We keep the party rockin off the hinges
We ain't showin off, we just goin off popular concensus
[Dr. Dre]
But critics say the Doc is soft, Doc is talk
The Doc is all washed up knock it off
Who the fuck is Doc impressin
Doc is this Doc is that you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc 'cause Doc left you all guessin
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record
We gonna have this mothafucka hoppin in a second (bump, bump!)
Thats why we always save the best cut last
To make a scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
[Eminem]
Cause we done swam with the sharks wrestle with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers 
Whom if it wasnt for rap to bridge the gap
Maybe raised to be racist
who may have never got to see our faces,
Graced the cover of Rolling stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races,
just call on the cape crusaiders
and leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic
And we can play the back and forth all day like the hot potato game
Thats why we came to...
[Chorus- Eminem]
Cause we came here to set this party off right 
Llet's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side
Cause I don't ever wanna leave the game
Without atleast sayin good-bye
So all my people on my left
All my people on my right swing one last time
50 Cent come on!
[Verse 3]
[50 Cent]
Bounce now hands up you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It's no secret everybody know when Dre's involved
There's plenty money involved
[Dr. Dre]
And plenty honies involved and sunny sunday's and palm trees
Cali everyday is just another party from the valleys
[Dr. Dre & Eminem]
All the way to them 8 mile alleys
[Eminem]
Let's ralley hands up for the grand finale now raise up out your seat
Dre's about to speak,
Blaze a pound of weed six days about the week
[Dr. Dre]
You can catch me in the studio bangin out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin out your speaker
[Eminem]
So never say never 'cause Shady Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit records presents the return of the
The Doc and Shady no one can do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a shred of evidence of the
[Chorus- Eminem]
We came here to set this party off right 
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side
Cause I don't ever wanna leave the game
Without atleast sayin good-bye
So all my people on my left
All my people on my right swing one last time
[Outro- Eminem]
