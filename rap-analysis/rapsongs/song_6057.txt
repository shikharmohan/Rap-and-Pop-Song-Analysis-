Come on now, I'm the one you love
I'm the one you can't breathe without, remember
Why you wanna make me cry like this?
Why would you wanna make me cry, why me?
Your love is like a chunk of gold
It's hard to gain and hard to hold
Like a rose that's soft to touch
Love has gone and it hurts so much
Well then why?
Must the same love that made me laugh
Make me cry?
Well now you think of a love as sittin' on a mountain
Think about it bein' a great big rock
Won't you think before you started to rolling down
'Cause once you start it you can't make it stop
I've given all I have to give
And if you don't want me baby
I don't want to live
Well then why, oh why?
Must the same love that made me laugh
Gonna make me cry?
Why you wanna make me cry?
Baby why you wanna make me cry?
Why you wanna make me cry?
Why you wanna make me cry?
Why you wanna make me lay in my pillow
I'm just cryin' like a weeping willow
Tell me why, oh why, oh why?
Why you wanna come home and make your lady cry?
Oh no you used to be so soft and sweet to me
And now you act so wrong with me to me
And now you get so wrong with me, with me
Why, oh why, oh why?
Ohh why you wanna make me lay in my pillow?
And got me cryin' like a weepin' willow there
Wanna make me cry oh why, oh why?
Why, why, why, why?
Why, oh why, oh why?
Why, oh why, oh why?
Why, oh why, oh why?
