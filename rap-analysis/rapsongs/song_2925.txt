[Intro: Ghostface Killah]
Aiyo, Ghost, what's up nigga?
This "Supreme" talkin' to you and shit
You caught me all the way in Staten Island to see you
Beat the two minute and thirty seven second clock
Suprise: time started already, muthafucka
Say that shit, nigga
[Ghostface Killah]
I'mma say it, don't get mad, y'all, I throw my darts sideways
Shoot 'em up, bang, bang, through me baby
Lovely lady, fuck the spades, drive the kid crazy
Before I go to bed, an hour later
People be talkin', I feed dolphins
My defense'll fly the coop off your mean office
My skills is a fortune, robbin' leech out a suite auction
Teach then fall off the greatest, fuck what they say
'cause we against the abortions, and we
Lay low-oh-oh, silent those clowin' foes
Got them clothes for his new feud in the road
We them Fat Albert, spot runnin' '86 crack viles and pictures
Lookin' all suspicous, I'm out..
[Interlude: Ghostface Killah]
Aiyo, hold up! What the fuck you stop for?
(I got somethin' in my--) Nah, you can't be stoppin', g
What the fuck you ain't got -- aiyo, you buggin' and shit
Son, you gotta hurry the fuck up
Time is runnin' nigga, come! What the fuck??
[Ghostface Killah]
I work magic out of liquor store
Give me a dollar and I turn that bitch into five
And all I need is one more, to get things started
Get retarded, and once you -- I'mma fix these artists
Take 'em one by one, tie 'em up, line 'em up
Treat 'em like a cigar, fire them niggaz up
They be up in the club, sixthree tree'd up
With them young 'keds with their gear all beat up
This is how I'mma kill 'em with four lines left
Hold your breath, say my n
