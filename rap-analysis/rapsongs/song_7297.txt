Hey Hey Hey Hey
Damn shawty
Look at you
I'm just saying man
Is it just me or you got too much ass in them jeans
Come here
Hey
I been watchin' you a while now
And i just wanna find a way to make you smile now
Why you blushing, forget about them other guys now
I know you aint trying to tell me that you shy now
I realize that youre beauty could intimidate
Them suckers you aint got no business with them anyway
With such a, pretty face big booty, little waistline..
I wanna grind from behind to the base line.
Have a great time, poor yourself a shot girl
Chase it with the lime, now you feeling like a hot girl
I know you're probably used to deal with them wannabe's
But honestly I gotta say, im who they wanna be.
I promise all I wanna see is you up under me
And we can disappear whenever, when you wanna leave
Come on I guarantee the ride of your life
Any fantasies on your mind, we can try them tonight
[Hook] 
Oh yeah sitting here (im looking at you like damn)
We sippin' on patron, something's on my mind (you wanna leave with me tonight)
It's been killing me all night long, and I wonder(Misses shawty let me tell you what I'm thinking 'bout)
Oh girl I wonder (for real shawty let me tell you what I'm thinking 'bout)
It's the end of the night, and I'm thinking you might
Wanna leave the bar, park the car, turn into a porn star
Yes, I'd love to hear about your interests
I gotta say, your intellect got me impressed
See youre panty's, do your dress like a silhouette(look at that)
Patrone got me thinking sex, is you feelin' that
No disrespect though, a simple yes- no
Hey let yourself let go, shawty let's go (let's go)
Pull you to the crib, get you to the threshold
Kiss you from your pretty lips to your red toes
Ay time tickin' its the end of the night
Hey you could leave with your friend if you like
But I'm saying though (I'm saying though)
Hey we could ride out
Back to my house
I wanna see you satisfied inside out
Once I'm in you aint gon' want me to slide out
You tell your girlfriends they  gon' wanna  try it out
A lil more let's loosen you up
What we can't do in the club we can do in the truck (lets go)

Oh yeah sitting here (im looking at you like damn)
We sippin' on patron, something's on my mind (you wanna leave with me tonight)
It's been killing me all night long, and I wonder (Listen shawty let me tell you what I'm thinking 'bout)
Oh girl I wonder.. (for real shawty let me tell you what I'm thinking 'bout)
It's the end of the night, and I'm thinking you might
Wanna leave the bar,  park the car, turn into a porn star
Hey would you..stay
Could you..play with it, with your tongue just a..little
You such a sexy individual physical and mental
And if it's sentimental shouldn't rules bend a little
Hey let me start at the top stop in the middle use a popsicle
Make you shiver giggle when it tickle
I could talk to you dirty if you'd like that (bad girl)
I finish once, hit a blunt, start right back
I know you told me you a good girl
But shawty you's grown woman not a little girl
You could blame it on the patron or the champagne
But sometimes being bad could be a good thing
