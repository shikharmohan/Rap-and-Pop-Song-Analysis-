Here come a bitch with the fly puss', and a nigga with the fly dick
In the Mickey and Mallory Mode, rollin' through the streets on 24's
On krunk screamin', die bitch
'Bout to shut yo' shit down, anybody that opposes to payin' us a fee false
If the straps don't bleed y'all
We put stitches in yo' motherfuckin' dome like a league brawl
Come and roll with us
Take a journey to the realm of the truth when I bust this
It's the Duke and the Duchess
Leavin' haters buked and on crutches
Niggaz you cannot touch this
It's a new collaboration of Thug Luv
Between the Thug Queen and the Thug Lord
More power than a drug Lord
Meant to be because we love each other the way we love war
Gotta rider bet hug yours, 'cause I'm full of ambition
And ammunition and a 50 like I smoked a sticky stack of hash
Ain't no missin' on no critical condition
Murderin' is the mission and we can bust a itchy atcha ass
Feel the flow when I drop it
Don't when to stop it, I'm goin' pockets and layin' bodies down
Feel adrenaline from me and Kim and them
We got it sewed from Brooklyn to Chi Town
See the artillery, we don't fuck around with silly games, plenty thangs
Nigga plus I got an illy aim, stick 'em up, steal his chain
Then I spill his brain, then I feel his pain
Some of the consequences when you dealin' with a plug thug
And I'm backed up by the Queen, we gon' take over the world
Whatchu know about Thug Luv
You can't fuck with us do it like a hustler
Gotta keep it gangsta, can't no one collide with us
All my true thugs and all my real bitches
Won'tcha come and ride with us
Do it like a hustler gotta keep it gangsta, can't no one collide with us
All my true thugs and all my real bitches

It's the T.W.I.S. to the T.A
K to the motherfuckin' I'm
'Bout to shut yo' shit down
Other albums come out ain't nobody gon' buy them
Now who gon' deny them?
I'm scared of myself, don't nobody wanna try Kim
Y'all know you done fucked up
Now whassup y'all better come roll with us
Who's you Mister? It's Lil' Kim and Twista and we about this
For those who doubt this, the game is ours we gon' run you up out this
What a wonderful feeling when you're stealin' a million
But the billion jackpot's what I aim for
Get your hands in the air, put 'em up, keep 'em high
Don't want no problems just gimme what I came for
Pull up on your block, eight straight hummers
'Bout to have it locked, eight straight summers
Bank account hold eight straight numbers
Ain't no room for you whack newcomers
We the people's choice because we kick that
Nasty Hardcore shit that you wanna hear
Can't fuck with us, hands down we win best murder rap of the year
Pounds to the misters, hugs for the miss
Bombs in the mail, sealed with a kiss
All my bitches pop that thing like this
All my niggaz wave that bling on the wrist
Some of the consequences when you dealin' with a plug thug
And I'm backed up by the Duke, we gon' take over the world

Kim is yo' flow hot

Twist' is yo' flow cold
Well I think so
Kim do you got dranks
Crist' by the box
Twist' do you got smokes
Well I got 'dro, now baby we can roll
Do it like a gangsta, creepin' like a murderer
Strapped while I roll on chrome
Lookin' for the ones we at war with
When we see 'em we gon' aim for your dome
Hear me Ma we can run this Earth together, come up worse than ever
Havin' big dreams while we back up this work together
Let's set up shop on the block now, takin' over yo' tip
Even if we gotta slang dubs
Go to war because I love blood, with a Queen by my side
Whatchu know about Thug Luv
