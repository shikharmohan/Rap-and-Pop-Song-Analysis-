Sometimes I feel like He don't hear me
Sometimes I wonder, do He love me?
(for all my soldiers)
Life is so hard, for me
this ain't the way 
it's supposed to be
I pray every night 
asking for forgiveness
Sometimes I ask myself, is it worth it?
Life is so pain-anful
yet im so thank-ankful
(okay)
Life won't be easy
and I know that
My past is over
wish I could go back
Maybe I'll cha-ange it
(what!?!)
Rearran-ange it
(uhh)
Sometimes in life we all feel like we fallin'
Those who suffer in life will be rewarded
Lord I hear hear you
but it's so hard being strong
I keep reminisicing of my loved ones that are gone
He's says son you should know you're born to die
I said I do it's just hard saying bye
(whohoo)
That's why
I feel like
You dont hear me
Sometimes I wonder,
do you love me?
Life is so hard for me
this aint the way its supposed to be
(moment of silence)
