Stacey Boots, perms and suits
I'm braided up, can fade it up
I skated up, you waited up
So you know I got to go ahead and tear shit up
Turn lose on these mutha**** Jelly Roll
Nephew, boy this shit is out of control
Rockin', rollin', bangin' B
A little something, something ****, that's banged up streets
Freak, freak y'all, into the beat y'all
And to all my Big Doggs grab your meat cha'll
And yes, yes y'all, oh we the best y'all
We got the **** that make the **** grab they breast y'all
It don't stop till the wheels fall off
954 headed swervin' in the goodin' clinic, tryin' keep it hot right
**** spot light
My **** Jelly Roll make it knock light
We all shinin' stars
Y'all know who you are
And dip low lows with me
You party with a D.P.G.
We all shinin' stars
Y'all know who you are
And dip low lows with me
You party with a D.P.G.
We ridin', dippin', slippin', slidin', east side up eastsiders
Riders, ballers, rollers, ladies
Players, gangstas, macks, pimps, and 'llacs
Hustlers, ****, **** and G's, we having big thangs blowing trees
Shinin', grinin', refuse to lose
I gotta a G in my pocket for dippin' out of shoes
I head the corner in the Navigator
Committed to excellence like a Raider
You hate a **** like me but you got to love me
Your lady wanna shove me and your kids wanna hug me
A **** **** like Buggsy Seagal again, I'm in the ringle again
I do it all legal again
I can't lose you won't win, respect the boss
If you run up, you gettin' done up, I love to floss
We all shinin' stars
Y'all know who you are
And dip low lows with me
You party with a D.P.G.
We all shinin' stars
Y'all know who you are
And dip low lows with me
You party with a D.P.G.
Why you acting bad, probably 'cause I'm know as the bad actor
In the rap game I'm the big factor, macker, smack a **** in a second
The Big Dogg **** very well respected
You gotta put your mash down when you wanna get to the top
The game is stuffy like Puffy don't stop
I thought I told ya, **** I'm a soldier
No Limit Lieutenant, yeah I did it
I'm committed like a mother**** supposed to be
Won't let no **** **** close to me
From my head to my feet I'm protected from harm
'Cause I'm a mutha**** shining star, you feel me
And **** who wanna kill me
You **** thrill me, but guess what will be
On top tip top, non stop, Dogg not
And you gotta let me end, the **** I'm a shine like a G
We all shinin' stars
Y'all know who you are
And dip low lows with me
You party with a D.P.G.
We all shinin' stars
Y'all know who you are
And dip low lows with me
You party with a D.P.G.
We all shinin' stars
Y'all know who you are
And dip low lows with me
You party with a D.P.G.
We all shinin' stars
Y'all know who you are
And dip low lows with me
You party with a D.P.G.
We all shinin' stars
Y'all know who you are
And dip low lows with me
You party with a D.P.G.
We all shinin' stars
Y'all know who you are
And dip low lows with me
You party with a D.P.G.
