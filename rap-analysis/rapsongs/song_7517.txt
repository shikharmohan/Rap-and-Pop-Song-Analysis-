Fuck y'all analog niggas, we be digital
Wu-Tang, Killarmy, we indispensable
We never fall, we stand tall
Like skyscrapers and Justice For All
We move on M.C's mechanically
Strike nerve like Ghost Vs. a Canopy
Hard to touch retarded fucks
Playing with they fantasies
Respect this, specialist, black testing
This will get ya necklace jacked
And named scratched up off my guest list
Party freak, you the type of nigga
That'll hardly speak unless you spoken to
We throw a cold screw and sober up
When I'm approaching you at the same time
We posting two niggas on tha ass-fist gonna do
What they supposed to do
The limelight snatched away from you
Because it's my night
Killarmy blaze inside of the twilight
You better get ya lines right
Half of these crabs can't even rhyme right
Which dart slows
With body movement and blurry eyesight
What you want I already got
And after I control I keep head high
Head pon-cocked
And pockets rollin', you foldin'
You fagot ass fuck yo, Farotion never fails
Shoot at darts sharper than a carpenters nail
Inhale life, exhale strive anxiety's
Trife blowin' smoke out my piece pipe
Ducking the snipe shot off the top
Of the White House and cop 4'S
War never does and many causes
My offense is my defense extreme precautions
Moving cyphers high velocities making you nauseous
Ya forcing it, garishly extortionists, aborting this
Space ship thats spacious face it
I'm on contain shit
Pioneer looking for honey and is it matrix?
The case is if not ya basic way to make shit
Embrace it knowing some day you'll have to face it
Fuck y'all analog niggas, we be digital
Wu-Tang, Killarmy, we indispensable
We never fall, we stand tall
Like skyscrapers and Justice For All
(So fuck y'all, so fuck y'all niggas)
Yo, yo hard to grapple
I raise the sharp scalpel
Technique slaps you
Invasion body snatch you money grip
I smoke the honey dip blunts, cherry bomb, very calm
First bursts like a shot from the Berry homes
You'd be most wise to pay close attention to Willy lynchin'
It's stupid to fuck wit' Bobby Steel's henchmen
I step into presidential credentials, evident my potential
Be infinate, deluxe benetic, sluts invincible
Only ones can know me, swore me before the Dolby
Alexis Colby broads try to control me, pussy whip me like Toby
Fuck the local, I move global, economical
Ship sea promise fool, my info glow
And the dark Wu-Tang logo
Sparks the attention, look listen observe
Killa bee swerv, slam like Dr. Julias Erv
Still strike the vital nerve
Charter through the Magna Carta
Trapped like Otis and Carter
Wild like the Shaolin style or Manos Harbor
King devine, forced to shine
Head burst open like a bottle of Pine
Use penmanship when I write my script
Blunt spark em' and them mark em' homeless
Killa Hill syndrome, peace to Two Tone
He must know me, to understand me
From what you do to realize I'm you
Everything I do, honey bee from the bee hive
Evergreen squeeze, dried leaf
Smoke Killa Priest from the tribe of Levi
Smoke out and not steal or blunt spill
The indestructible Bobby Steel's is here
Yo, in the heat of the night
My 4-7-7 mash on the mic
Killarmy and Trappa John M.D, full metal jackets
'Cause some gots to have it
Kill or be killed, only time will reveal
I think by myself and I drink by myself
From 9-8 until let me know its real, son
If it's really real
Understandable, self explainable
Caution, John Blaze flammable
When under pressure, interchangeable
And still coming down like precipitation
As I reign undisputed, how Johnny do it
Dangerously, whoppin' cough
(Cough, cough)
Two and off stank pussy make my dick soft
(Huh)
Bottom line be this high
Explosive, not for the average Joseph
Come and get some, hold it
Keep one up in the chamber,  blast with my middle finger
Now I toss men attack like the Four Horsemen
See me dog walkin' strickly getty-o slang talkin'
All up in thease guts, soften, these rap niggas, official
We slap niggas with mack charges dope shit regardless
We usually take another niggas garments
(What?)
Straight up and down
I got this rap shit locked in '98
Niggas can't escape the laws that I enforce
Like top notch politicians who be pola-tickin'
Slam through expand
Total construction across the planet
And micro chip software placed in the rear of ya ear
As I sit the next year
All y'all analog niggas, fuck y'all, we be digital
Shit is critical like the hallways in my projects
Similar to the streets in Tibet
Fuck that, I ain't playin' wit' a full deck
(Son, son, son, son)
