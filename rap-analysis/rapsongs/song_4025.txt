Verse 1:
Young mane for President
I'd probably paint the white house black if it was my residence
Bush back in office some niggas feel that's irrelevant
Cuz they still pedalin' this medicine but anyway anyday
I can zurk off quick and make my semi spray
Send some of my men your way just to blow yo men away
Stephon Marbury type bullets they like to penetrate
Young Money we outta school but we got chemistry!!
(Young Money muthafucka)
Young spitter, young mane, young cop, young mob, tez pole
We don't past the rock nigga we ball hogs
Mad slow in the escalade nigga y'all all fall
Jack yo fresh ass caddy and steal yo white wallz
Nigga we don't like y'all
Hell yeah we will fight y'all
We ain't on no Tyson shit
We ain't tryin' bite y'all
Knuckin if u buckin probably bustin' at yo couzin
We youngin's that's 'bout somethin'
Y'all niggas ain't 'bout nuthin' (chyea, chyea)
Verse 2:
Nigga we bustin, and bussin to the bang'o bust
no we don't run for the olympics but the flame with us
I got that tussin' that scummy and that angel dust
So pick yo high i will supply and correct changes was sup.
We bring the bussin' we bussin' like this thang for us
You niggas is sleevless man you can't hang with us
I got a bitch who speak Spanglish
She keep her bangles danglin in the cocaine that's right up in her anus
Oak Wayne is right up in the spot where he is suppose to
B got ova at the game and now he coachin'
Me but I've been the champion happy as I ever been
Lampin' in the hamptons like what the fuck is a hammock
The chef up in the kitchen like what the fuck is a sammich
I'm like we gotta find middle ground we need balance
Challenge me rap beat to my advantage
I'm outstanding like standing outside up in the twister and walking not damaged
Standing outside up in the blizzard and walking hot headed
Serving nicklebacks and Iraq bet I will not panic
Swerve the nickel black if I wreck bet I will not panic
Cop another one the next day and drive it crazier
The seats will be lazier shit'll be gravier
Nina Sarafina my girl so then I baby her
Wavin' at her at 2 crazy four gazee's I'm 2 brazee 3 brazee's
Deep we got 380's and P 80 9's 9's M-10's and M 1's and 12 gauges
Shell cases money put up for jail cases they`ll make it
My momma say tuck yo chain son they'll take it
I hit em' with one of those stale faces like
I'll be damned momma they know who I am momma
I'm still yo little boy but to them I'm the man momma
Fuck wit yo boy man how hollygrove the hood nigga
Throw it in yo face till you get that understood
Verse 3:
Niggas know I'm heavy with the coke with the coke
In the Impala SS and sittin' heavy on da spokes
Neva am I broke man I'm playin with some change
I get a nigga soaked like he playin in da rain
And everywhere i go a ho starin at my chain
I'm the Most Valuable Playa in da game
These haters wanna rob me
Because I got more kicks then niggas with black belts in karate
Keep a redbone with a real nice body
Just copped a 'Lac and a yellow Maserati
Niggas ain't fuckin with this dough
When young money shoppin we don't leave nothing in the mall
These niggas ain't as rich as us man ya rims to small
Get yo muthafuckin' inches up
Cuz i copped me a benz today
Just to go on 106 and Park and hand the keys over to Free and AJ
