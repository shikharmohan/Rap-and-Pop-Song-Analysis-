Come on and let the games begin
'Cause the game begin when you coolin' wit ya friends
And the friends to tha end that don't pretend
So have fun, have fun, have fun while it lasts
It's time to max, relax, ask anybody
You got off work, you know your boss is a jerk
Whether you a clerk or a rapper like me
We all need to kick back and be care free
See, no plea bargainin'', no harborin'
Negative attitude when you're out with your dudes
Damn it feels good when the weekend comes
Ya done finished your homework, ya out with the buds
Clownin', y'all downin' whatever goes
You throw in a tape hear a nigga kick his flows
Cruise down the strip and pop at some hoes
Y'all still havin' fun, no matter what scenario ya chose
Even on the solo with those, take off ya clothes
But not without the condoms 'cause that's bose
Those woke up the next day, call ya patna's
Pitch in for a ten and start up the festivities
No fuckin' worries when ya livin' free of stress
That's why we always smoke bomb, fuck sess
Ya'll feel the best when ya'll say less
At the [Incomprehensible] 'cause it's June 'cause we outta school
Come on and let the games begin
'Cause the game begin when you coolin' wit ya friends
Come on and let the games begin
'Cause the game begin when you coolin' wit ya friends
Come on and let the games begin
'Cause the game begin when you coolin' wit ya friends
And the friends to tha end that don't pretend
So have fun, have fun, have fun while it lasts
Your friends are ya friends, like no matter what
Other fools get from ya team
Yt seems like they dream of gettin' next to you
But all they really do is pester you 'cause they marks
Always wanna start funk when you wit 'em
'Cause when he got beef wit a nigga
He thinks ya'll will get 'em
Now he rollin' with your crew
But with no crew he wouldn't be poppin' doo-doo
His ass would be through but now he drug you into it
And yes, all your boys and now you gotta kill the noise
He destroys the whole vibe by frontin'
Tryin' to be hard, but he just Napoleon Bonaparte
A little nigga tryin' to take command, thinkin' he the man
But fuckin' with him, y'all will all kick the can
I can't stand a fake
I kick it with my real nigga's come spring break
That's the ones I look out for, never doubt your pals
Fuck them gals, don't let 'em separate you
Your friends and you will be chillin'
When that bitch hates you, yeah and I say
Come on and let the games begin
'Cause the game begin when you coolin' wit ya friends
Come on and let the games begin
'Cause the game begin when you coolin' wit ya friends
Come on and let the games begin
'Cause the game begin when you coolin' wit ya friends
The friends to tha end that don't pretend
So have fun, have fun, have fun while it lasts
Now when ya got business to attend
Take care of that and afterwards fuck with your friends
Don't put shit off 'till tomorrow
Do it right now 'fore you fuck with your pals
That's the down period, rest and relaxation
At that nigga Plus house, let's go to nations
And get fit when life is the pits
You know I check my friends, make sure they legit
Wether is freestylin', you know we stylin'
Nigga's pillin' up with the gin in the cup or a blunt and no english
So nigga's think ya fiendish
Playin' NBA Jams and just like the beats we slam and dunk
Callin' niggas punks when we was poppin' junk, playin' dozens
'Cause we like cousins and brothers I wouldn't have it any other way
You know what they say, all work and no play, ect
