Bet it, bet it taste like candy
Bet it, bet it taste like candy
Bet it, bet it taste like candy
I broke up wit my ex, I couldn't take his sarcasm
Everytime we bone, I had to fake an orgasm
Moanin' and groanin' tried to make him feel manly
I'd rather use my toys, plus my hands come in handy
I finally told him that my heart was somewhere else
Whenever we sexed, I wished that he was someone else
That dude that approached me at the bar the other night
That be the mister right and hot enough to melt some ice
I think I'm in love like Beyonce be with Jigga
It's not his major figure that want him to be my nigga
He got that magic stick that make my little pussy quiver
Juices runnin' like a river slowly down my kitty litter
Boy, I'm so glad I found a nigga like you
A thug like you to make a girl say, "Oh"
Hope he feel as strong as my po hah do
With you by my side, it's like I'm drunk off boo
If you be my man, only my man
I wouldn't mind tastin' your magic stick, c'mon
(Magic stick)
If you don't cheat or sleep around
Ain't nothing wrong wit tastin' your magic stick
I bet it taste like candy
(Candy)
Meant to melt in my mouth
(Yes)
I know you got planet, baby you the shit
Now what you workin' wit
(C'mon)
Candy meant to melt in my mouth
I know you got planet
I like the way, I like the way
I like the way, I like the way
(Work that magic stick)
I like the way you work your stick boo
(Work that magic stick)
The way you work it like voodoo
(Work that magic stick)
The way you wind, and you wind and you grind
Don't stop the way you work your stick, baby
  (Work that magic stick)
(Work that magic stick)
The way you work your stick, baby
  (Work that magic stick)
Keep on and keep on, and keep on keep goin'
My ex boyfriend had to go
He didn't know how to work that magic stick
(Magic, magic, magic)
But I found a guy that sure do love
It's so true his love is classic, yeah, ohh
I bet it taste like candy
(Candy)
Meant to melt in my mouth
(Melt in your mouth, boy)
I know you got planet, baby, you the shit
Now what you workin' wit
Candy meant to melt in my mouth
I know you got planet
I like the way, I like the way
I like the way, I like the way
(Work that magic stick)
I like the way you work your stick boo
(Work that magic stick)
The way you work it like voodoo
(Work that magic stick)
The way you wind, and you wind and you grind
Don't stop the way you work your stick, baby
  (Work that magic stick)
(Work that magic stick)
The way you work your stick, baby
  (Work that magic stick)
Keep on and keep on, and keep on keep goin'
I could play gin and you could play J.D.
If you like Beyonce you could play Jay-Z
Check for them other chicks 'cos they not me
They're just some copy cats there's only one Missy
M to the I double S don't test
I'm hard as the cushion on a bullet proof vest
But you got me whipped like slaves in the days
You're cool as the shade and ice and lemonade
I think I wanna marry, your baby I will carry
Guess it's necessary and on the contrary
You be mister right and mister legendary
The more I fall in love the more it gets scary, c'mon
(Work that magic stick)
I like the way you work your stick boo
(Work that magic stick)
The way you work it like voodoo
(Work that magic stick)
The way you wind, and you wind and you grind
Don't stop the way you work your stick, baby
