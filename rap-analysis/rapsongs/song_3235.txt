Give me a black goddess, sister, I can't resist her
No stringy haired, blonde hair, blue eyed
Pale skinned, buttermilk complexion
Grafted, recessive, depressive, ironing board backside
Straight up, straight down, no frills, no thrills
Miss six o'clock, subject to have the itch
Mutanoid, caucazoid, white cave bitch
[Incomprehensible]
Ease back, white bitch, I don't play that
Just because I got on my L.A. hat
Stalkin', walkin' in my big black boots
Is my jingle, now you want Mandingo
Big, black and handsome
I should hold your devil ass for ransom
Sorta like Patty Herst but I'll burst first, bitch
And you know what's worse
I'm coming from the land where the choppers roam
So fuck you bitch and your Coppertone
Stringy hair, no derrier, frontin' and fakin' with your silicone pair
Do I wanna fuck?  Not hardly
That's kinda like Barbie phuckin' Bob Marley
It ain't gonna happen, I keep rappin' muthaphuck Teniell
But see I'm the captain of this ship and I'm true to the game
Ya, all look the same, standin' by my backstage door
Hopin' that'll switch, spread out you little cave bitch
[Incomprehensible] you're goddamn right, oh yeah baby
[Incomprehensible] you're goddamn right, oh yeah baby
Why everytime we get famous
You wanna play us like Andy and Amos?
The devil sent you to try and tame us
But you can't tame me with no bitch named Amy
Lookin' for the dark meat
But ho, I ain't tryin' to go out like Barkely
'Cause everytime I turn on the TV
I see several brothers with she-devils
Smilin' 'cause you out on a date
But sooner or later, the bitch'll yell, "Rape"
Soon as daddy found out you a jigaboo
He'll kill like he did Emmitt Till
Yah, he tried to kick bass
But the bitch probably threw it in his face
Sargent Bale ain't nothin' but a trick
Nasty as hell, stanky little cave bitch
[Incomprehensible] you're goddamn right, oh yeah baby
You're goddamn right
[Incomprehensible] you're goddamn right, oh yeah baby
White bitches have no blood and [Incomprehensible]
White bitches have no blood and [Incomprehensible]
White bitches have no blood and [Incomprehensible]
White bitches have no blood and [Incomprehensible]
Now don't think that I hate you
'Cause I won't date you, bitch I gotta stay true
You could be a fan but don't expand
And try to get my dick in your hand
You better run to the minute man
Pale as snow, so act like y'know
'Cause if I slap it, flip it, and rub it like that
Yeah, it gotta be black
Plus yo ass too flat
I need a butt big enough that can clap
Rat-a-tat-tat, you can't get mine ho
I'd rather fuck an albino
At least I know, she's comin' from the Nubian
And not the Ku Klux Klan that you be in
And I don't give a fuck if your family is rich
You're still a little cave bitch
[Incomprehensible] you're goddamn right, oh yeah baby
You're goddamn right
[Incomprehensible] you're goddamn right, oh yeah baby
[Incomprehensible] you're goddamn right, oh yeah baby
You're goddamn right
[Incomprehensible] you're goddamn right, oh yeah baby
[Incomprehensible]
[Incomprehensible]
[Incomprehensible]
