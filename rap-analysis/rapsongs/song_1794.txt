Man
Shit stay happen
You know its crazy dog
Its off the hook but you know
Real niggas survive
No regardless them heartless
Who is this I see comin' through?
It's like three on the a.m I'm a rob this nigga
An when I'm done I'm a slay him
For bein' stupid like comin' through after one or two
And havin' a gun that he couldn't get to that one'll do
Foolish niggas learn the hard way then I teach 'em
Be in the wrong place at the wrong time then I leach 'em
Like Jigga said "niggas test you when your gun goes warm"
So I keep 'em scatterin' like roaches when the light turns off
From night to dawn right from wrong hope no way
Three fifty seven slugs with a snub nose dray eight
Settin' all you bitches straight squashin' all beefs
To the point where the police be blockin' all streets
Got me trapped up in the buildin' but you know how that go?
I stay fuckin' with the hood rats and I run up in the rab hole
Run through the hallway see police face to face
And bein' I'm tellin' you this story means I caught another case
Its either you or me
And more than likely it's gonna be you than me
All right? Feel me O
Day two of the saga this fuckin' drama continues
Wakin' up like every two hours lookin' out my window
Plus I keep the Four Four pointed at the door
Just in case when they bust in I bust them and I'm gunnin' for the face
"What a waste of potential" is what my Teachers used to tell me
"You can always get a job" and cheap shit they tried to sell me
Got me no where but broke and fucked up in the game
But now I got a name and niggas know my name
Knock of the door police we lookin' for a man
Who killed a couple of cops last night and the reward is ten grand
I play like a bitch its just me here and I'm not dressed
And that guy sounds kinda dangerous I hope you make an arrest
That was a close one now I know I gotta get outta the city
'Cuz I know I'm hotter than lava I'm holla the mouth
Got my dog on the horn he like "Fuck you done did it
They a ran up in my crib nigga pattin' down my kid"
Put the harness on the dog load up the weapons
Murder's on my mind no half steppin'
Motherfuckers want war you can get it
'Cuz I'm tired of runnin' remember me as the nigga that died gunnin'
Kamikaze mission C-4 strapped to the chest
Run up in that joint raw dog fuck the vest
They can keep theirs because it won't be the slugs that'll kill 'em
It'll be the raw of the C-4 as I'm bringin' down the buildin'
When I go takin' a bunch of the motherfuckers with me
I ain't sittin' around waitin' for them faggot niggas to come and get me
I bring it to 'em service with a smile
What nigga, didn't know a dog with rabies was up in the cut nigga?
Now that you finally findin' out what this shit means?
I'm at the precinct hundred and sixteenth run up in there
Open up my jacket you motherfuckers lookin' for me?
Well here I am now you comin' with me
Man that shit is crazy baby
Can you dig it can you dig it
Can you feel it, is you with it
Its off the hook you all, I'm happy
