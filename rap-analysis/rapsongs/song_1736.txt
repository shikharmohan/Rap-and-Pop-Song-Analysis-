 [Shock G]  
 Heheheheheh  
 Yo Hump  gonna do a lil somethin like this  
 Lots of little knots that need to be tied  
 A pair of knuckleheads walkin side by side  
 down the altar, you say to yourself, "I will not falter"  
 Saw the def cutie that made your heart sing  
 But you're thinkin it -- how did I get myself in this predicament?  
 You hop to the shop to get a ring (a big diamond)  
 You hopped to the shop and got a ring...  
 You hop to the shop to buy a ring (a BIG DIAMOND!)  
 But now you're at the altar, your goose is cooked  
 Felt left out cause all your friends are hooked  
 You say a prayer, "Lord please give me strength to make it through"  
 Opened up your nervous mouth, slipped and said, "I do"  
 Look you do son, now hurry up and kiss the brizide  
 I don't, IdoIdoIdo, I don't I don't, IdoIdo, I don't, I don't  
 Peace said the father, cause now the knot is tied
