I'm on a rampage
Ripping up the damn stage
Full time ____ killer
Some say renegade
Part time psycho
Sipping on lemonade
Don't won't trouble
But I give it to you anyway
Yes I'm insane
Put you in pain
My mind is big train
To live in the fast lane
Should I slow down
Fuckin speed up
You better take a hit of my weed
You need some
Go hard, know hard, live hard, die hard
Brave one, cap one, fake one, slap one
Brave one, jack one, save one, gat one
Rise up rise up take me higher
Got my hands on the wheel and I'm never lookin back in my rear view mirror
I'm a trouble seeker, I'm a trouble seeker
Can't eat or sleep in need of medical attention I'm a trouble seeker
