To bring you down, bust it off
To bring you down
Uh, make shot one time for the Mecca don
To bring you down and the Soul Brother #1
To bring you down
Y'all get done with the YG Menace II Society
To bring you down, feel the real steel, the hot metal
To bring you down, to bring you down
It's the Killa Bee, kill rugged, skill vest often
And land your fuckin' asses in a coffin, what?
You see cold steel, you niggaz wanna mill' like Shaquille O' Neal
Bullets are real, cock it back and then I peal off
Fuck the kamikaze Mecca is on the shotty hottie
The cops are runnin' white chalk around your dead body
Abandon ship, niggaz are ready to flip and bag a punk
They can't fight next night, twistalism by your grave sight
Over, yes, you over six feet under
You see, I'm not at ease you're diseased
A reason for the treason, hunt season I'm from rabbit ordeal
Where niggaz kick the beer loungin' off block
Till the early morn', word is bond, another brother gone
Would've been bullshit, quick talkin' with nines and banana clips
For million with bloodshed, the color red, two through the fuckin' head
Man, you're dead, death becomes you
So listen, to bring you down
So listen, to bring you down
So listen, to bring you down
So listen, to bring you down
So listen, to bring you down
So listen, to bring you down
So listen, to bring you down
So listen, to bring you down
Infrareds locked on yo' heads, here come the feds
Freeze now when I squeeze hot metal breeze
Right through your arteries to bring you to your knees
I think he's dyin' black
I got the track to send you silly ass niggaz back
Snatch you hoe, stab you pimp and watch him limp away
I fiend luchi till I'm fucked up old and gray
Hey, dog, I send you to the morgue
I'm from the Vernon ville blood spills shells drop
And when it go pop, pop, my glock hit that niggaz nut
'Cause I'm one of the hard ox's smokin'
Motherfuckers like crack rocks huh, so back up
Be ghost when I keep my toast murder she wrote, yo
Fully equipped with this death blow, flippin'
Because I'm on the level like the rebel
Crazy bodies and tombstones
Straight to the devil nigga light in ya bed's right
Because ya tune from me let miss due
Strictly nigga death becomes you
So listen, to bring you down
So listen, to bring you down
So listen, to bring you down
So listen, to bring you down
So listen, to bring you down
So listen, to bring you down
So listen, to bring you down
So listen, to bring you down
So listen to what we say
Because this type a shit it happens everyday
No resurrection with protection slay cut up in the blender
Just like Mohammad blowin' up the World Trade Center
The hell raiser burner blazer stressin' major caution
See the Mecca Don swirvin' a tongue like Jordan
Anything you cherish I perish, I'm here to roll
And now your bucks are big, and let out ya asshole
Gun smoke when the hood is broke and need the riches
'Cause all this nigga want is more dough and more bitches
Buck, buck, buck, buck, rat, tat, tat, I'm on a mission nigga
I shoots to kill when I pull the motherfuckin' trigger
I'm sick in the head, I'm crazy I'm fuckin' wild
I swear to God, I come from the P now
I'm Menace like Dennis, so don't try to play me close
I wave my gun in the air yo I don't fuckin' care
It's Pete Rock on the mic check one, two
I got the glock, nigga, death becomes you
So listen, to bring you down
So listen to what we say
Because this type a shit it happens everyday
To bring you down, so listen [unverified]
