Shut up nigga, shut the fuck up, nigga
Here they come, here they come
Here they come nigga, duck down nigga, duck down
There they are
Shit, come on nigga, come on
Nigga run for it, nigga make
Freeze motherfucker!
Shit
I'm Lil' Ripsta, I'm leather face, comin' to kill them at night
Die, die, die
So we buck them studio thugstas
I'm willing and ready to ride
I pop, pop droppin' them niggas with the glock gun
Nigga, you best start run, duckin' the shotgun
Leavin' 'em up off my block stunned
One eighty seven lesson and we done told ya
You fuckin' with Bone, you better believe we livin' like soldiers
We lovin' that thugsta shit so nigga just throw your pumps in the air
Then you pump, pump, put one in a coppa like ya just don't care
You don't wanna fuck with, you don't wanna buck with a realer nigga
Better check my manuscript, drugdealer, killa, cabbage peeler
Thug with Lil' Ripsta number one with the gun, come, come get some
Senseless killa Fifth Dog and posse run get gone
Fuck with the Bone four niggas strong, leave 'em alone 'til it be on
Krayzie put on one in your dome
And nigga be thinkin' I'm wrong, so go on
'Cause nigga the sawed-off ain't full of shit
Me lovin' to smoke tweed and me weed man
They givin' me what me need man, when I light my blunt
Fold the niggas up in me hood, so when we smoke, smoke, smoke
Get paid good, so we gonna blaze good
So come to the land where all the thugs be real
Them St. Claire niggas they ain't no joke so catch a slug or chill nigga
I'm Lil' Ripsta, I'm leather face, comin' to kill them at night
Die, die, die
So we buck them studio thugstas
I'm willing and ready to ride
Lie down with your hands behind your back
Naw bitch, you lie your funky ass on the ground now
This seemingly routine investigation
Had become a horrible nightmare
Running with gats and bats, so nigga don't test
Rest or you get a peeled cap
Pap, pap that pump, better check that gun
For a nigga done get that skull cracked
Lil' Rip done rolled up, the bigger the nigga, the quicker get showed up
Let's swerve to the birds set up a hold up
So many bodies me blowed up
Nuts bucks and guts nigga mistakin' them balls for dogs
All niggas'll get mauled, no thing to pick up a pump
And people know ya and never hold ya especially when them rolls up
Bet I bringin' in them guns run a thug get low down
You don't wanna get nutted 'cause nigga you gonna get bloody
Once you see the braids and skully
Cuttin' that throat when I'm rippin' up somethin' lovely
What is it in ya? Deep in the dead when we get fried
POD when I comes to ride
Creep but you sleep and then fall in the night
Once inside forgettin' about remorse your curse will ride
Cry now when you're ready to lie down
When I'm weak in a mental state, somebody gonna die now
Meanwhile swerve to the burbs
Man, he just all of a sudden just jumped out of a window
I didn't know what was goin' on I'm just walkin' by
Just got a bottle of wine, I was just walkin' by
And all I seen was him jump when that lady yelled
And that was it, I don't know
Well, I saw his wife begging him
And she said, "Don't jump" and he did
Did you know the guy? He sure had a problem
That's all I could tell ya
All I seen was them put the lady in a police car and take her
I guess it was his wife
