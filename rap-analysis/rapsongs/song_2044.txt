This is dedicated to the niggaz that was down from day one
Welcome to the aftermath
Like we always do about this time
Welcome to the aftermath
The aftermath, a second growth
The period immediately following an unusual event
This is brought to you by the makers of funky music
Coming directly to you from The Soul Kitchen
So let's get deep, you ask how deep is deep?
Can I ask you how deep would you like to get?
The aftermath brings to you some of the best
Hip-Hop and R&B; on the planet
We're comin', we're comin', we're comin'
We're comin', we're comin', we're comin'
We're comin', we're comin', we're comin'
We're here
Watch yourself, peep the blow up
From state-to-state we're touchin' home
No matter what sign you throw up
Wait, we're on some other while you're still slippin'
Bringin' you all bangin' speakers for sparks fly out the car system
Off the tops, snatchin' props and the proper the tops we touch
We're hard to knock, we got it locked
From every angle of music, the different sound view
R&B;, Rap, whatever flavor, kid, it's all new
So say we bring it with the East and the West
The final results, the aftermath touchin' every coast
So when the bar blows then the DJ spins
And we don't set trip, we set trends
Love to the artists, in fact they be the smartest
If they business is tight
'Cuz keep it real means moving the cash markets
And constantly buildin' and stop destroying
Everything that we touch
And leave somethin' for our children
Whatever it takes to get ya paid, yea-yea-yeah
Keep on doin' it, keep on doin' it, keep on doin' it
And whatever it is that gets ya free, yea-yea-yeah
(Gets ya free, yeah)
Keep on doin' it, keep on doin' it, hey, keep on doin' it
Whatever it takes to get ya paid, yea-yea-yeah
(Whatever it is)
Keep on doin' it, ya gotta keep doin' it, keep on, keep on, yeah
And whatever it is that gets ya free, yea-yea-yeah
(Whatever it is that gets ya free, yeah)
Keep on doin' it, keep on doin' it, oh yeah, oh
Ya gotta, you gotta keep on doin it, doin' it, doin' it
Aftermath is gonna keep on doin' it, doin' it, doin' it, yeah
