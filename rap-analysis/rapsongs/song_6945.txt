Yeah, expect the unexpected
It's kinda hard to keep faith in the things that you do
When everybody turns their back on you
It's kinda hard to keep faith in the things that you do
When everybody turns their back on you
It's kinda hard to keep faith in the things that you do
When everybody turns their back on you
It's kinda hard to keep faith in the things that you do
When everybody turns their back
Yeah, I know a city that's surrounded by a beautiful beach
The economy boosted by the drugs they move in the street
More clearer than the crystal sky, blue as the beast
But the people ain't got shoes for they feet or food to eat
So they hurtin' but what's for certain you can get you some heat
And over beef, you laid to rest like you was gettin' some sleep
Where the little kids get ammunition, word, you can't get no nutrition
Or any type of suitable livin' condition
Listen, they shoot you over that paper, it's just survivalist human nature
To put you out of your misery like euthanasia, yeah
Don't let them fool you, we ain't different than the youth in Asia
Africa and Europe, it's a small world, we truly neighbors
If they the Third World, then who the first to get to Heaven?
I know it's hard but who does God choose to go through it, worst
Usually it's the prophets, ask a cat what really matters, nowadays
Usually, it's his pockets
We gotta get back to what really matters, word
We gotta search our soul to find out what we're after
The more I find my voice the more they try to make it harder
Mom and dad don't forget to warn your sons and daughters
About the nature of the world today, the nature of the world today
The nature of the world today, the nature of the world today
Word, don't nobody talk no more, they all text message
Drivin' and typin', not payin' attention, missin' they next exit
Dependin' on navigation, they never know where they're goin'
They're stayin' stuck in one spot, they're not growin'
I'm so over cryin', waitin' and hopin', playin' the lame game
The game changed me into 'A Different World' like Dwayne and Wayne
I'm gettin' high just to maintain, yeah
Take my music like a drug and drop the needle in the same vein
I get a rush like I'm tweekin' off blow
Except it ain't via the nose, it's from deep in my soul
The street slang, I be speakin' in code
Kick in the do's, freakin' the flow 'til the speakers explode
We in control, the people know I speak the truth
The power of my roots is thicker than sour sop
And they so strong they bustin' out the flower pot
Family tradition is to tell 'em you love 'em
While your family livin' from granny in the kitchen
The little man in prison
We gotta get back to what really matters
We gotta search our soul to find out what we're after
The more I find my voice the more they try to make it harder
Mom and dad don't forget, to warn your sons and daughters
About the nature of the world today, the nature of the world today
The nature of the world today, the nature of the world today
It's kinda hard to keep faith in the things that you do
When everybody turns their back on you
It's kinda hard to keep faith in the things that you do
When everybody turns their back on you
It's kinda hard to keep faith in the things that you do
When everybody turns their back on you
It's kinda hard to keep faith in the things that you do
When everybody turns their back on you
I'm just tryin' to get back to what really matters
I'm tryin' to search my soul to find out what I'm after
But the more I find my voice the more they try to make it harder
So mom and dad don't forget to warn your sons and daughters
About the nature of the world today, the nature of the world today
The nature of the world today, the nature of the world today
Yeah, it's all natural, baby
It's how we put it, yeah
Yeah, Brooklyn to Tennessee
You goin' up with me
Yeah, yeah, break it down
