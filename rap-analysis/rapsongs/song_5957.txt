A yo Puff check this out I'm tired of fuckin' dictating on these 
mutherfuckers lets take it to the next millennium on these niggas 
you got to keep bubblin' on em platinum doublin' on em fuck 
these niggas A yo I bumped into these cat an' they was like 
"Yeah what up wit that nigga Puff he swear he nice " I said yo 
he don't swear he nice he knows he nice. 
You Public Enemy number one right now fuck that dash spit 
that hydro-ghetto shit, 
(Puffy) 
Lets go, 
thats that beat right here 
who should I fear 
throw your hand in the air 
socialise, get down, let your soouulll lead the way 
cause i'm that enemy that you can't see 
who you wanna be, you ain't shit to me 
It ain't hard for you to get to me 
playa, my own dogs, they'll spit fo me 
so if you want whats mine, you gots to have the heart 
I've seen em come and i've seen em part 
If you ain't want beef then why did you start? 
Front from the light catch shots after dark 
suffer duck or you'll catch these 
on the spot, red dots make em all believe 
ain't nobody kicking the rhymes like these 
see I do the things that they can't achieve 
so don't start bassin' an' i'll start pacing 
bets on that you'll be discracing 
more hotter than the sun, 
I'm living on the run 
because i'm Public Enemy number one 
Chorus (singing with beat scratching in the background) 
one, one, one one, 
one, one, one 
one, one, one 
let me ask you, what you got against me? 
is it my girl or is it the Bentley? 
is it my house? or maybe its all three 
I just came up and you're all against me 
now ask yourself, why is he number one? 
now ask yourself, who's done what he's done 
then ask yourself, you're fifth of the long run 
you think its a game cause you fucked the wrong one 
always with God and I don't swing solo, 
never back down when I got a throw dolo 
wanna see me out, but I just won't go though 
pretty young thing wanna have my photo 
one in the room hangin' on the wall 
in rememberance that I rocked them all 
got no time for those that think small 
grill me in the club cause they can't ball 
hate shot callers, 
hate them ballers, 
back in control now I call orders 
it's no fun fleeing under the gun, 
because they got me Public Enemy number one 
Chorus 
All you suckers, liars, 
caught at the fires, 
wanna infiltrate and break my empire 
I spit lines, hit rhymes, keep dimes sweating 
giving them the juice thast their not gettin' 
a bonafide playa, now who got the flavour 
a non-stop, rhythm rock poetry sayer 
I'm the life saver, the New york mayor 
before you try me, you better say your prayers 
my word to the wise is "Do not cry," 
you know that i'm gone then say don't die 
I take what I find, put a beat to they rhyme 
thought it was over but I crept from behind, 
wanna try to stop me from speaking my mind 
almost 2000 and running out of time 
almost to the point when I wanna bust nines 
a lot of straight faces, I can only trust mine 
soldiers in positions, all on the front line 
don't make a move till I give them the sign 
known as the poetical, lyrical miracle son 
because i'm Public Enemy number one 
Chorus 
Yeah yeah, thats right Puff, Thats what i'm talking about love, 
sparklin' and glisten on thes mutherfuckers, these niggas talkin' 
foul like, talking about what you got and what they ain't got, 
they wanna bring you down. 
(beat fades)
