And if you ever have a son, I'm a buy him a gun

Give that microphone
So I can take it to the front line
'cause in a rap war, I shoot off rhymes
And sound off a park like an m-16
When I hit the scene, suckas turn green
'cause I take the microphone and then I disrespect it
And then I disect it,
Put it back together
Lyrics or knuckles man whatever
'cause you tried to step into a lyrical punch
I had you all for lunch and took a shit

[krs]
Now all type things that went on this evening
They all say they fresh but I'm here now
Who you believin
Who couldn't hear a hit if you hit up
What a pity, you tried to be quick wit the tongue
Your style is dibbie-dibbie
You need no lyrical rush in your mumblin
Whatchu sayin? 
I serve you up like stove top stuffing
Im gonna say this once and I mean this
Disattach yaself from my penis
Give my genitals room to breathe
You take shots at me wit a weak album I cant believe
You got no skills, chill plus your corny
You think your hardcore 'cause you got a 40? 
My car is not tint
I don't eat wit a chip
When I read I don't squint
In real life I got the hard shit
You cant out grow me
You don't even know me
I be leavin the jam wit your black ass as a trophy
This is nobodys style but the teacher
So don't compare me to none of these creatures, features
Feature and battle rappers
Krs one is the head clapper
Chorus
Nice & smooth dem have a title(title)
Flavor unit has a title(title)
Nice & smooth dem have a title(title)
Kid capri have a title
Buck! buck! buck!
Me a de don-don, de don-don, de don-don diggide
De don-don, de don-don, de don-don diggide
Remember the name of the crew is called b.d.p.
Remember the name of the crew is called b.d.p.
