[Havoc] 
Ashes to ashes dust to dust 
stainless steel gats 
never rust big till bust you could touch 
blessed wit the real side of life 
just enough 
you couldn't fight me wit your strongest mic 
layed down niggas eyes visualize bad reception 
maced your interference souped your upperbody section 
I travel like a 2 2 bullet 
throughout your body repped to the fullest 
Queensbridge representin 
representin the hollow tip crew 
blue slips, seen ships, you talk shit I follow through 
once the kite is sent 
I might get bent, but still planted 
no second thoughts, 'cause my conscience is demandin 
for the bloodshed(bloodshed) I leave that mug red(mug red) 
I'm like cancer cant catch me 'cause I done spread(done spread) 
gone now dead, enough said from the scene I fled 
wit the paranoid thoughts runnin round my head 
It's like that war, project niggas strike back it's on 
what the fuck you sick I'll be right back 
wit the gat and temper end your motherfuckin era 
your shortie set you up you betta dead-her 
hunger for the cheddar big ends and better 
Armeretto sours alcohol consumption 
why you runnin we thumpin 
do to the fact the infamous is bumpin 
ice real son you frontin 
Chorus 
It's like that war, project niggas strike back it's on 
what the fuck you sick, I'll be right back 
Prodigy 
right back to the fact that 
here take that, right back at you 
were goin at to 
already ran through 
wasn't hard to capture, what is it that your goin after 
the fourty-fifth will make your clothes damper 
put in the hamper 
the fabulous Infamous is movin stainless 
crime-tainin, to all my niggas hold your bangin 
live in action, if you weere dapped then relax then 
what the fuck you said? I be right back real maxin 
blastin, terrin up your Fila fashion 
give him what he askin feelin aint know what happened 
back at the cabin, be at the round table plannin 
spread team across plannin, expansion 
slap a nigga opened handly style something foul 
for tryin to slow down, my cash pile a hundred mile 
I can recall the days, juvenile crime pays 
14 years old, shorty from round way 
brick ass cold, still puffin night to day 
but why did my life have to be this way 
I rock Velour suits, flavors like mixed fruits 
my loot give recoup razors in my suit 
incase you try to troop me to the island 
I known for start whylin 
back in New York, my shortie's got the cash pilin 
peep this on some knowns and teef shit 
so much drama, who the fuck knows who we got beef wit 
lift you up off your feet like ski lift 
for packin big fifth 
niggas who riff but nigga you riff 
then Im on the next life gettin bent in the clouds 
on my way down souh for international crowds 
Chorus
