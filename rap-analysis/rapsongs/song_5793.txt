What you about to hear gon' fuck you up
Because this the first time you ever heard some shit like this nigga
I'm tellin you this shit so off the fucking hook bro
Ya'll man look, check this shit out
Mystikal and Juvenile nigga
Say juvey they don't believe you did the beat bro
What you mean nigga, fuckin' right I did this beat
I tried to tell them niggaz bro
I come with my own look, my own sound, my own style
Who the fuck you think drawed this crowd
It's the ripper, the clean up hitter
You bitter intimidating young long dick nigga
Now suck it, now suck it, while you around here playa hating
Your woman around here screaming fuck me, fuck me
Tell me something, don't I put down on my albums
Motherfucka nobody ever told you I was hard as a NFL helmet
I write 'em, land 'em, plant 'em, bam nigga can't stand 'em
On top, on sight, heads up, bust 'em at random
I got the vest out, put the braids back, put on the bandana
Signed a brand new contract, shot the video in Atlanta
Don't pull me, can't hold me the beat don't move me
You know smokin', drinkin' whenever I kick it with Juvey
Back on my own, back on my zone, feelin' better, lookin' better
Bout to go get it and bring it back home
A nigga got, got but I won't no more
'Cause this time round I come to settle the score
Greedy niggas eat good, but not that long
They wind up with a stomach ache balled up in they home
A nigga got, got but I won't no more
'Cause this time round I come to settle the score
Greedy niggas eat good, but not that long
They wind up with a stomach ache balled up in they home
You better cancel that shit, about you run this here
I ain't seen you on the charts what you done this year
Y'all thought "Project English" was the last of this shit
When I was really only given y'all half of this shit
Fuckin' right I made the beat and I wrote this rap
But a niggaz in the ghetto want to post the crack
Got two niggaz posted watching a bus with macks
Just waiting on the police and niggaz to jack
To people across the nation, thanks for being patient
Ya'll been itching for some G-shit huh, I know you waiting
When you cop the CD, get some herb and ride
Turn the bitch up real loud so you can feel my vibe
I got a long way to go, I'm just gettin' started
I'm 26 years old and I'm still retarded
I ain't talking about handicapped, I'm talking about the way
I talk and express my rap, you feelin' that
A nigga got, got but I won't no more
'Cause this time round I come to settle the score
Greedy niggas eat good, but not that long
They wind up with a stomach ache balled up in they home
A nigga got, got but I won't no more
'Cause this time round I come to settle the score
Anytime you say my name make sure it's some good shit
Look I'm not your eldest rapper, I stay on some hood shit
Am I hatin' on cash money, now stop playin'
I respect it how it came, now I got game
I'm all about U.T.P. family and kids
And takin' care of business it the way that we live
I don't need a record deal just give me my props
How many muthafuckas you know keepin' it hot
Believe it or not, keepin' my spot locked
I got more season than the seafood out the gumbo pot
Now run your mouth and lose your slot
I make 'em feed for me like junk is fever one more rock
Ain't this some shit I'm famous and rich
I got bitches I ain't even fucked claiming my dick
If that's how it is, I guess we gone see
Is this all about that big truck and U.T.P
A nigga got, got but I won't no more
'Cause this time round I come to settle the score
Greedy niggas eat good, but not that long
They wind up with a stomach ache balled up in they home
A nigga got, got but I won't no more
'Cause this time round I come to settle the score
Greedy niggas eat good, but not that long
They wind up with a stomach ache balled up in they home
A nigga got, got but I won't no more
'Cause this time round I come to settle the score
Greedy niggas eat good, but not that long
They wind up with a stomach ache balled up in they home
