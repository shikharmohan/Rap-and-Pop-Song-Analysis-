Yea, I know it's kinda cold outside,
Bring your nasty ass inside
Play yourself a dark corner mafucker, yea
Come on, can't stop, won't stop, rockin' for you, niggas
'Cause I rep the street and Johnnie Cochran for you, niggas
And I, got a state gun cockin' for you, niggas
Twenty-One legal gun shots
Poppin' for you niggas
And I, blow tones, more force than cyclones
Shit is on every time I catch a Ron Jones
Thug bitch, rock boots and hoops with rhinestones
Got the key to the city and run the crime zone
Now come on, take somethin', shake somethin', break somethin'
Stop, close your shop, you, niggas ain't sayin' nothin'
Niggas be frontin' and knowin' they ain't really weighin' nothin'
Better stop 'fore, we pop and really get to sprayin' somethin'
Flood it up
Whip it up
Smoke it up
Blooded up
Niggas straight tryin' to brake, I tell 'em shut it up
I spit the ill for real, ain't nothin' buttered up
Flip mode, doin' it everybody love it up
East coast, what up? West coast, what up?
Midwest, what up? Dirty South, what up?
All my chicken heads, put it in your mouth, what up?
It's flip mode, better stay up in your house, what up?
All my thugs, what up? Thug bitches, what up?
Street niggas, what up? Stack riches, no doubt
We got the block locked take another route, what up?
It's flip mode, better stay up in your house, what up?
My niggas hook
Dirtiest, wordiest, Jersey, it's wetter than a mile
I stalk like pedophiles, no body gets saved when I bless the child
Gettin' Eight like snapper you too fessed to vow
Hold up
Run on
Get up
Come on
And put every single nigga where I'm from on
Bitches all in the spot, go ahead and get your fun on
Niggas keepin' it movin', go head and get your thug on
What on earth possessed y'all to try a lil' drunk lil' high?
Big heads in the sky make niggas straight cry
Without Mo' and Dry, take it down homeboy got bigger fish to fry
Fuck that other nigga, rush that sucker nigga
Niggas love the way we sound up on another Digga
Hot D, but I got another younger brother bigger
Digga pass me the Henny, so I can take another swigger
East coast, what up? West coast, what up?
Midwest, what up? Dirty South, what up?
All my chicken heads, put it in your mouth, what up?
It's flip mode, better stay up in your house, what up?
All my thugs, what up? Thug bitches, what up?
Street niggas, what up? Stack riches, no doubt
We got the block locked take another route, what up?
It's flip mode, better stay up in your house, what up?
My niggas hook
Switch it up like Ak Nel, why you hit a dry spell?
Cats like you get no reply on the Skytel
Hate y'all, raps like Eminem hate Britney
Bonafide MC, who fuckin' with me?
Top niggas better give props nigga
'Fore you get dropped, fuck around and get your shit popped nigga
Flip flop niggas, you could really get your shit mopped
Or left to lay up in a pit stop, nigga
Spillin' it
Feelin' it
Killin' it
Come on
The hardest M.C don't want flex no more
Make it hot every time I rock, rest assured
Shit'll have that, who could rock the raw best award, nigga
Look it up
Cook it up
Shook it up
Book it up
When we rock, you shouldn't watch promoters, nook it up
Raise the level a little, you know my niggas took it up
In and outta big figgas, while me and Digga cook it up
East coast, what up? West coast, what up?
Midwest, what up? Dirty South, what up?
All my chicken heads, put it in your mouth, what up?
It's flip mode, better stay up in your house, what up?
All my thugs, what up? Thug bitches, what up?
Street niggas, what up? Stack riches, no doubt
We got the block locked take another route, what up?
It's flip mode, better stay up in your house, what up?
My niggas hook
