Got a early call from Kisha, Kisha wanted me to meet her
She said she thought it was time to make the relationship get deeper
Said cool then I'm gon' beep ya
What would be a good time to reach ya
She said what about ten but l thought eleven would be sweeter
'Cuz she wanted me to see her, said I needed a teaser
But shit who got the keys to my Beamer
I rolled me up a blunt and got the Crystal out the freezer
I hopped in the two seater, left Nae-Nae with Macita
Vroom speed up run faster than a cheetah
Only thing on my mind is how I'm gone get all in this cheap slut
Should I use a rubber 'cause I heard she was a freak
But hey, say she keep it cleaned up but I don't want HIV bruh
I drop my top on da drop-top, her name's on my beeper
I called her on the Nokia and told her come pick me up
As soon as I got in the house she got on her knees
And grabbed my penis, ate it up like some peanuts
I said, "Ohh Kisha"
Chopped off like a millimeter, she drunk it like a 2 liter
She blow like a pro, oh no, I got to keep her
Told her I'd be back about eleven I'm gone creep her
But don't go to sleep, I got some more meat to feed ya
Now I'm hot, I wonder what's up with Kisha tonight
I'm gone give her a call, see if it's alright
For me to dip through, she said it's all gravy
First I got to get somebody to watch my baby
Baby it's all good, I'll be there in a minute
But she didn't know I knew Wayne was already hittin' it
Soon as I pull up I see my dog runnin' out
He saw me peepin' at him but he didn't open his mouth
Soon as he pulled off, I knocked on the door
Sayin' to myself look at this dog ass hoe
It's cool what you do, you know I like my shit sucked
For you to swallow the cum and put ice on my nuts
Caught my nut, now I'm up, I'm gone holla at ya Kittie
I got studio tonight, me and da H B'eezeys
I can't be late, I'm gon' see ya when I could
Hit Juve on the hip, let him know it was all good
Oohh, ooh, there she go, on the way to the corner store
Lil Turk let me know, we done fucked the same bitch before
Say lil' mama where you headed, she told me forget it
Hop in the back seat of my car and she spread it
Say baby slow down I don't wanna fuck ya first
I want you to suck on my dick until my nuts will burst
She was a fool with it
She said she had a good teacher she went to school with it
'Cuz she knew what to do with it
I didn't want the bitch to have my car smellin'
So I took her in the alley with some K Y Jelly
Pull your shorts and your draws down to your knees
Put the rubber on the dick handle that please
I hit it she sucked it
Hit it she sucked it and sucked it
I got tired of the pussy and mouth and I said fuck it
Hey hoe, I gotta ride
My baby moma beepin' me
And she stay way on the other side
I hit B.G. on the celly
And told him that
The bitch was all good up in the alley,
Not the telly
This hoe don't know I know she fucked three of my dogs
I caught her walkin' out the alley down by the mall
She fucked Wayne, Juve, Turk, I know she ain't got no walls
But they told me she'd do a damn job on the balls
She provided the number later on gave her a call
Told her what I was thinkin' and she was down with it all
Can't deny it she was a fool kept that dick standin' tall
What she'll do a nigga, should be against the law
That's how Hot Boys play it when we finish we toss
Baby when you finish Manny Fresh down the hall
After this episode that hoe won't be able to walk
After two or three steps that hoe might fall
Now you know then Hot Boys sad ha
Get in the bitch head, end up doing somethin' bad ha
Kisha got did right, yeah
Fucked the whole Cash Money click all in one night, yeah
