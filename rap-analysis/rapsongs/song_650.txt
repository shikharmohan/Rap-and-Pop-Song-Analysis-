Everytime I, turn around
Everytime I, turn around
Everytime I, turn around
Everytime I, turn around
Everytime I turn my head, man
Somebody's schemin' on a bad plan
Tryin' to deal a nigga a bad hand
One after the other, harassin' a thugsta
At first they try to bring me in court for child support
Women deception and they lies
I'd rather keep my jim' in my shorts than save a hoe
I have to go and serve state time
There's always somebody talkin' 'bout you owe 'em
I made not a dollar, you didn't sell nada
Niggas ain't even grateful that we let y'all ride
You better be thankful we even let y'all shine
Everytime I turn around there's somebody straight trippin'
Hatin' on a mission, fakin' on a nigga
They always talk with some dump in they mouth
Like Bone Thugs won't really turn it out
Go down like snitches, sheisty like bitches
They gotta realize that it's five of the realest
Everytime that I turn around
Somebody all up in my business
Actin' like you know me, I've never seen homie
He try to lean on me I'ma put the beam on him
Tele-screen on me, really if he only
Knew that we split him like a blunt then roll him
Everytime I turn around I see another phony
Thug haters really seem weak for the moment
Bone Thug niggas never beat, we told 'em
Guess they thinkin' niggaz was weak but we showed 'em
We on top it ain't no stoppin' us, the suckas wishin' we would go away
So they can flood the game with that garbage
I'm poppin' 'em, stoppin 'em, any day they wanna get with Kray
Kray, take action, Jackson
Everytime that I turn around
I'm duckin' haters over here, haters over there
Everywhere I turn they everywhere
Everytime that I turn around
Duckin' haters over here, haters over there
Everywhere I turn they everywhere
Everytime I turn around somebody doin' somethin' foul
I can't turn my back without these haters tryin' to shut me down
Plot and I watch, strategize but the clock
Is sayin' time don't wait for nothin', it don't stop
Crabs in a bucket make me wanna say fuck it
Like pop, pop, pop, pop, pop but y'all lucky
Eastside, front to back, we guard that
Don't nobody want you when yo' ass is broke flat?
Yeah, nigga all that, we livin' in a cruel world
It's rough in the ghetto but we put family first
When friends turn to foes and the enemy's exposed
That's when you gotta move on and kick dirt
My wife and my seeds dependin' on me
To make it home safe with them groceries
How it's 'posed to be, they ain't close to me
Yeah, I'm in association but I'm playin' for my own team
Too much division, head-on collisions
Is blockin' my visionary skills
Get back to the mission to pay my own bills
Stay on point and I guard my own grills
Skills I'm possessin', in my possession
Why they wanna rob a little nigga for the blessin'?
Who is you helpin', the world or yourself?
Put it on the table 'cause that's the real question
Everytime that I turn around
Turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around, turn
Everytime that I turn, every time that I turn around
Everytime that I turn around
Keep it thuggin' green, nigga sweet, come get it
I wouldn't even take it if I wasn't gon' listen
But look here, this here, some of y'all garbage
I know you didn't feel it when a nigga didn't call ya
Keep your CD, save your money, it's hard to make a dollar
You wastin' your time, swallow your pride, be smart
You good to take advice? Alright, nigga get a job
And a message to the niggas tryin' to sue me
You make me hate the spotlight
'Cause I really wanna do you
Lazy ass bums, in the cut cowards
Back door pussies stretchin' them undeserved dollars
I know you want a taste, I'ma bring it to your face
Bring it to your face, say it to your face
I hear your little chatter sayin' that the Bone done
Smilin' in my presence hatin' on that thug love
But Bone got a category, fan base thug love
Hit the avenues, never done, let 'em know it
Y'all niggaz chump change, chase fame, earn mine
Within the right to take mine
Take it to the top with a dream from the block
Didn't believe, now they got they hands out
Make me feel bad with the weight on my shoulders
Damn, everytime I turn around
Everytime that I turn around
Gotta watch my back from these haters, cops and fakers
Come with the drama, nothin' can break us
Everytime that I turn around
Gotta watch my back from these haters, cops and fakers
Come with the drama, nothin can break us
Everytime I turn around
Somebody givin' me the rules, a new ordeal
The cops harassin', shakin' me down on parole
And put a nigga through the whole damn spiel
This kid lookin' polished
No wonder I got a rap sheet way more enough to fill an album
Stack keep it full throttle
They lookin' for the heat, that's why they got 'em, C-L-E my motto
Within the Lord I'll abide
Example of a good role model I'm tryin' to provide
But every time they pull me over, it's like I'm back on trial
They tryin' to catch a thug dirty while I'm ridin'
You see a nigga fully rehabilitated
Back reunited with my fam, still we are the greatest
Broke up then we woke up
Spoke up, niggas got it together and made up
Now we got 'em jumpin' back on the bandwagon
When we gon' drop? That's all they keep askin'
When we do this shit we'll hit the fan
Every sucka that hated on they gon' get a thrashin' now
Everytime I turn around
These biters tryin' to take our sound
But yo it ain't nothin' that can fade our style, my style
Everytime that I turn around
You lookin' over here, got me lookin' over there
The devil's everywhere, I'll watch my derriere
Everytime that I turn around
You lookin' over here, got me lookin' over there
The devil's everywhere, I'll watch my derriere
Everytime I turn around gotta listen to the sound
Of the negative crawlin' all over the ground
Like look what you did, let me enter in your kiss
Nigga save me, suck my what? I'll kill your babies nigga
So the wicked was the corner place, dweller place
Never gon' eat that, eat that
Satan the original serpent on his last track
Flat broke, dead on his back, crawlin' on his belly
Lookin' for his celly, I can call the telly
L.A., Kelly Rowland, rollin'
Next my ass, I know you bitch
You gets no ass, goin' down like Nelly
Everytime that I turn around
You lookin' over here, got me lookin' over there
The devil's everywhere, I'll watch my derriere
Everytime that I turn around
You lookin' over here, got me lookin' over there
The devil's everywhere, I'll watch my derriere
Everytime that I turn around
Everytime that I turn around
