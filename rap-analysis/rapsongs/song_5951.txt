Yeah, we up now, yeah
Yeah, we up now, c'mon
We up now, yeah
Yeah, we up now, c'mon
Yeah, we up now
Yo, now nobody party like we party
You wouldn't know 'til you cats see me party
I hardly sip Bacardi, so your clique think
A nigga too pretty to sip a mixed drink
But chicks think when they see I be a VIP, D I double D Y
Be the cat that kick back, bring all the stars out
Same cat, you know bring all the cars out
All our street cats buy all the bars out
Don't know whatcha all 'bout but I'm livin' it up
Ten mill' yeah, I'm bigger than what
So you know on the low when I blow, niggas givin' it up
They know why everythin' I touch is so fly
Mult-I, so I stay swimmin' in cho-chi
All day the niggas from New York to Norway
My name hold more weight than Broadway
You like the way I do the things I do
It's all for you
No way to fill my shoes 'cause all I do
I do for you
The more cheddar, the more better
Ever since I was young I was a go-getter
And you should know better to call Puff the coke teller
Knowin' I'm a hummer wholesaler
And you should know this
I'm a poet, got money won't show it
I'm like Russell plus I got the right hussle
Talk slick, I might bust you
Watch your manners, I be on the cameras
I be the next cat down in Atlantis
Or Pacific to be specific, lifestyle too terrific
Hop in the van shop when we land
Don't worry 'bout the pilot chattin' in the chopper's my man
I ain't only from Harlem, I'm from the heartland
When I got problems I send in a dark van
Cats in the street treat me like a mob man
Been number one so much, call me Mr. Chart Man, c'mon
You like the way I do the things I do
It's all for you
No way to fill my shoes 'cause all I do
I do for you
Yo, I tried to hold back, I can't hold back
Y'all could be all that, I want it all back
I sat back, let niggas get they dough
I played the cut and let niggas rip they show
Sip they mo', watch niggas pop they Cris'
Cop they whip, brag about they watch and shit
But watch this shit, I'mma put a stop to this
I got to flip, the V's niggas pop the shit, come on
And I been copped the six, been droppin' hits
Been rock my wrist and flood my dial
These haters be hatin', but love my style
And ladies go crazy, they love my smile
P Diddy the man push Bentley Sedan, nigga
Get money, that's simply the plan
True chocolate mack who's pocket's fat
You wanna rock, nigga? Rock to that with Bad Boy
Baby, you know it minors won't show it
Like in your way, I'll make you feel
Baby, you know it minors won't show it
All that I do is yours for real
You like the way I do the things I do
It's all for you
No way to fill my shoes 'cause all I do
I do for you
You like the way
