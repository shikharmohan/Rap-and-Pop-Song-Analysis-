Yeah, yeah, yeah
Bone, it's goin' down, man
Yo, this how we do it
Now that I'm gone
None of my enemies can hate on me now
And all my friends can do is pray for me now
Only God can judge me
Now that I'm gone
None of my enemies can hate on me now
And all my friends can do is pray for me now
Only God can judge me
Now that I'm dead and gone
I finally got these niggaz up out of my business
Death has severed all my friendships
It's been hell ever since I've been here
All these fake niggas come to my funeral
Look at them sheddin' they dry tears
Look at my baby mamas and them trippin' out
Actin' a fool front of my kids
Then I got niggas puttin'
Drug paraphernalia in my casket
A spliff, a picture of me still livin'
And a bullet from a Magnum
Man, I feel bad for my family
But in death it's a safer place
Than bein' amongst these chumps and scavengers
Then one of my niggas say
He said, "I'll see you in the afterlife"
Don't he know that it's only G-O after life?"
My nigga been learned wrong
I don't plan on goin' to heaven
I'm tryin' to get ready for the resurrection
But until then I'm patiently restin'
Think of my sins, no need on me stressin'
Now that I'm gone
None of my enemies can hate on me now
And all my friends can do is pray for me now
Only God can judge me
Now that I'm gone
None of my enemies can hate on me now
And all my friends can do is pray for me now
Only God can judge me
See, now that I'm gone and I'm dead and I'm buried
In life in a hurry like why did I run with straps?
I made it, tell Fe-Fe don't worry
I scrambled and scurried but only my lungs collapse
Surely I'll make you a song for that
How could I really go wrong with that?
Sayin' that smokin' was killin' my vocals
Not sayin' that Layzie put on for rap
Known for rap and soldier'd up
Can't none of y'all say that I owed y'all nothin'
When I fade to black just hold it up
Y'all better say that I made y'all somethin'
When the shells collapse and the soul relax
Lookin' down at yo' body, Wally
Walk through the tunnel went into the bright light
Hopin' he did right by somebody
I mean, I ran with the right team
Did my dirt had fun in the night life
It wasn't a pipe dream
My legacy tellin' me I live Christ-like
I hear what they sayin' but fuck all the weepin'
I peep it just keep it, I live mine
Celebrate them good times
Just read the will, Stevie, Stevon
Now that I'm gone
None of my enemies can hate on me now
And all my friends can do is pray for me now
Only God can judge me
Now that I'm gone
None of my enemies can hate on me now
And all my friends can do is pray for me now
Only God can judge me
Life dealt me a raw deal
Had to make it for what it was worth so went on to sick-ville
Just what have I done?
Signed in my balance then had to get strong when I took the deal
Strugglin' and strivin'
Farther my purpose to toil harder
Tryin' to make good off my honor
'Til a hater really make me a martyr
Kiss my, gonna miss my daughters
Hope I taught my seeds proper
I love my mother and father equal
But I did damage to so many people
So much evil it's hard to see through the dark
Gotta fight fire with fire
Let it spark and light up my way
They said he went out in a blaze
My enemies steady hatin'
Waitin' for me to take my last breath
No longer flesh
Had peace and yet the rest consume and avenge my death
Served my stretch, did my best
Then it's back to the Lord who made me
All the rest of y'all can judge
But it's only up to God to save me
Now that I'm gone
None of my enemies can hate on me now
And all my friends can do is pray for me now
Only God can judge me
Now that I'm gone
None of my enemies can hate on me now
And all my friends can do is pray for me now
Only God can judge me
