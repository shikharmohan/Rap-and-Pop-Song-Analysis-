You ready? Okay let me wind you up
Do it exactly the way I said do it man
These niggas is pussy you heard me?
Get up nice and close, ya
I put that battery in his back
I'm the reason why he moves like that
That's my motherfucking toy soldier
I tell him pop that gat, he gonna pop that gat
You don't want to play with my toy soldier
I say it's on then it's on until your life is over
Fucking with my toy soldier, if he's a casualty of war
Trust me I got more, you don't want it with my toy soldier
Now listen up close and follow instructions
Catch a nigga slippin' run up on them buck 'em
I ain't got no conscience, no morals or nothing
They ain't with us they against us we supposed to touch them
Here's what to do if you see them approach me
Pop that nigga I don't care if he know me
Half the niggas hating on me use to be homies
I don't trust them when they smile or playing 'cuz they phoney
Every time I come around they call the police on me
That's why the D's and the prisents know me
They know about my rap shit, they know how I'll clap you
Run like I'm in a track meet, swift with the Mac B
Can see the envy in there eyes for sure man
Mad as a motherfucker that I'm holdin'
See me in the back of the phantom
Quick to make examples out of niggas for sure man
Hold me down
I put that battery in his back
I'm the reason why he moves like that
That's my motherfucking toy soldier
I tell him pop that gat, he gonna pop that gat
You don't want to play with my toy soldier
I say it's on then it's on until your life is over
Fucking with my toy soldier, if he's a casualty of war
Trust me I got more, you don't want it with my toy soldier
Shoot, stab, kill motherfucker
You ain't 'bout it, I don't want you around cocksucker
Every word out my mouth is felt
That Uz I pop, them hollows so hot your ass will melt
Barber razor in the club, stunt, ill give ya a shape up
Have your ass stitch, gauged, your head all taped up
Niggas know how I get down
See they know when I'm around, my soldiers around
And if some shit goes down and a nigga get laid down
It's no surprise cause niggas know how we get down
Black tints on the tested Rosta, hammer out the hosta
Gat in my lap in case you gotta get clapped
You monkey niggas went to my hood
We on that guerrilla shit, you clap off and miss
We come back and start killing shit
Catch us on the corner wearing black chinchilla shit
We organized, disciplined plus we militant
I put that battery in his back
I'm the reason why he moves like that
That's my motherfucking toy soldier
I tell him pop that gat, he gonna pop that gat
You don't want to play with my toy soldier
I say it's on then it's on until your life is over
Fucking with my toy soldier, if he's a casualty of war
Trust me I got more, you don't want it with my toy soldier
Through the window into a mans soul
Fill you with holes listen homes
I'm the man for the job, we ain't playing
Yayo, come on
I'm in the coupe or phantom and the body kitted
Waves in my hair looking like Tsunami hit it
Niggas scheme the infrared beam on the mac
I put green on your head like a Oakland A's Hat
My boy was a douljah, now he's a soldier
My little son Dula, lettin' off the Ruger
In the whip mashed up looking for his enemies
Riding and gassed up off double D batteries
Tonights casualties is hooked to them Iv's
That's when I squeeze, click clack take that
Fall back, it's a contract 50 grand
I'm 50's Man
I put that battery in his back
I'm the reason why he moves like that
That's my motherfucking toy soldier
I tell him pop that gat, he gonna pop that gat
You don't want to play with my toy soldier
I say it's on then it's on until your life is over
Fucking with my toy soldier, if he's a casualty of war
Trust me I got more, you don't want it with my toy soldier
Ya, this is the general speaking
When I say move, nigga you better move
Soldier, I want nobody talking to none of my niggas
Come around with here with their bullshit
Trying to feed niggas bad information and shit
That's how my toys malfunction
