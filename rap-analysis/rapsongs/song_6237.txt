Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, check it out
Introducin' the international
Worldwide, Brick City
To each his own, I'ma have this known from the door
I make niggaz walk like ball four
Y'all score games down the block
For me it's hip hop around the clock
Critical, I'm bound to drop, stop
You ain't know I'm nice girl, you'se a 'Wannabe'
Like the Spice Girls, you betta think twice, girl
I'm untryable, undeniable
Won't be held liable for givin' knots that's untieable
R O Z, recognize my name
Rap G.I. Jane, rockin' colorful wide frames
Straight from Newark, we Brick layers, Na Na slayers
Don't play, I coach an' pick players
In Da Bricks, get your shit popped locked an' stolen
Step back, I'm holdin', bitches be rollin'
Ghetto style, I'ma stay that ripper
Tryin' to get cash out the ass like a stripper
Dub O, I'm down for whateva, do what I gotta to get the cheddar
Fuck takin' over cities, we conquered galaxies an' better
I was put here to crush CDs an' wreck tapes
Make a false move, I put this whole fuckin' planet in checkmate
Hell with this, we takin' over the spot
I don't like to but I will resort to the glock
The whole camp is sick, you can't do nuttin' but like it
It's like when you drown, your ass sink quicker if you fight it
Talkin' 'bout you used to rob niggaz with pump shotties
I know you a club music nigga but you ain't got a jack in your body
You fake ass niggaz, gettin' screened like a short pass
An' if you incorrect, I'ma diamond cut your bastard ass
You got mind control over me like Deebo but you ain't my friend
'Cause when I'm around you be quiet
But when I leave you be talkin' again
But we gonna do it how you want 'cause I'm widdit to brawl with you
Now what if I put your bitch ass in a headlock an' fall witchu
Yo niggaz, shut your windows an' close ya doorz
Comin' straight from Da Brick City
Yo niggaz, shut your windows an' close ya doorz
Comin' straight from Da Brick City
Your bitch said aliens raped her an' her four friends
But it was all the Outz, we dressed up as Martians
When I crack a brew, it's nuttin' else I'd rather do
Hop out a cab or two to your avenue to battle you
Your style get ate like Italian steak
Then I get Red to sell you achy or a pound of shake
Y'all can open up wide an' suck this dick
None of y'all niggaz can't fuck with Bricks
While you scrubbin' dishes, we puffin' Swishers
Fuckin' women ends up in the Benz trunk with switches
We cop sixty-three nigs
One from every spot, blunts be mystery mix
We got spots, all my niggaz stay in Bricks
While y'all stash clips in bags of Bar-B-Q potato chips
Plus your main honey loved us
Slip her some bomba, she'll fuck twenty of us
Yo, you pack that little ass gun like 'Harlem Nights'
After we brawl an' fight, yo' bitch, I'ma ball tonight
At shows we so tight, we flow like it's one mic
Raw underground, yo Don, tell 'em what that dough like
D. Don, I gets mine an' stay gettin' it
My thug mind'll brawl with rhymes an' stay shittin' it
Check my shine, iced out platinum like your pendant
V.I.P. ghetto nigga, hustlin' an' spendin'
Got bitches trickin', tryin' to get with me
Got police, flock niggaz tryin' to cop from me
How many pounds you want, how many pounds you need?
I cultivate every block I go an' drop seeds, nigga
I grow trees, niggaz know me, for bein' low key
That hustler from A.C.
I'm steady shittin' on hoes
Grand Royal like the Green Eyed Bandit
Jump straight in the Lex offa New Jersey transit
Let my man spit that Don shit
Gov-Matic spit that shit that's toxic, I rock shit
It's that hot shit like Busta Bust got
Plus I bust glock, on pussies, I trust not
They get blown, burned like minutes on cell phone
Bring the terror to your block
Like the toughest nigga from jail home
An' you dead gone when my squad come around
We hella illa from Isabella to Downtown
Comin' straight from Da Brick City
Comin' straight from Da Brick City
Comin' straight from Da Brick City
Comin' straight from Da Brick City
