Nigga ain't tryin' to do too much
All I wanna do is have fun with my loved ones
Spend a hun' on my loved ones
Make a run with my loved ones
My relatives and my cousins
All I wanna do is have fun with my loved ones
Spend a hun' on my loved ones
Make a run with my loved ones
My relatives and my cousins
I like to get down with my peoples and my folks
My dogs and my locs, the room filled with smoke
I got these Crip niggas talkin' to the Bloods
And niggas ain't spreadin' slugs but spreadin' love
(Yeah)
It's the thang we do since '92
What's the use of you killing me and me killing you?
We at the picnic, off the liquid
We the illest in town and nobody gets sick
Heard these freaks don't get along
'Cause one hair is short and one's long
(The dick don't care 'bout no hair)
What you talkin' 'bout? We can work it out
When you with me nigga, all the drinks on the house
(Yeah)
All I wanna do is have fun with my loved ones
Spend a hun' on my loved ones
Make a run with my loved ones
My relatives and my cousins
(What you wanna do?)
All I wanna do is have fun with my loved ones
Spend a hun' on my loved ones
Make a run with my loved ones
My relatives and my cousins
(What they hittin' for Cube?)
Oh, you wanna pay the price?
I'm like Poltergeist, when I get ya dice, I make 'em do thangs
Man I got the method like Wu-Tang
Have you niggas changin' like mood rings
So we should kick back on this six pack
Where them bitches at with the fifth of yak
(Oh, they went to get some food too)
I know the people that you came with
And hang with but who's you?
They call me Short Khop
I'm the nigga in the bathroom
With the two bitches and the door locked
(You?)
I know you famous and I must be buzzin'
But can't nobody give head like yo' cousin
(Fuck you)
All I wanna do is have fun with your loved ones
Spend a hun' with your loved ones
Make a run with your loved ones
Your relatives and your cousins
(What you wanna do?)
All I wanna do is have fun with your loved ones
Spend a hun' with your loved ones
Make a run with your loved ones
Your relatives and your cousins
Now be careful on yo' way home, you know it's on with the police
They can't see a nigga get no peace
They pull you over, never carin' if you drunk or sober
They wanna fuck with yo' nuts
Call yo' baby momma sluts, put you in cuffs
In the afterworld, yo' ass gon' get touched
We see you later, workin' for them haters
Fuckin' space invaders comin' up the elevators
To 304, damn, that's my suite
Why you bammin' on the fuckin' door and holdin' heat
Bring yo' ass in, come on, have a seat
We can meet over somethin' to eat, muthafucka
'Cause all I wanna do is have fun with my loved ones
Spend a hun' with my loved ones
Make a run with my loved ones
My relatives and my cousins
(What you wanna do?)
All I wanna do is have fun with my loved ones
Spend a hun' on my loved ones
Make a run with my loved ones
My relatives and my cousins
(It's on me and you)
I ain't fuckin' with no niggas that don't love me, bitch
Fuckin' with y'all muthafuckas
We through with the bullshit
Kick rocks nigga, with that bullshit kick rocks
All I wanna do is have fun with my loved ones
My relatives and my cousins
Connect Gang, Connect Gang
Put it down like this
Put it down like this and never ever miss
