That's right, nigga, Southwest Connection, straight up
Servin' more than peanuts, bitch
Niggas tryin' to stay rich
How many ways can a killer get paid?
How many niggas want a gansta boogie?
I see the junkie in your eyes
What do you see me when you see me?
A G in disguise
Been hypnotized since '85 with gansta shit
All you niggas get live and represent my click
Got bits and pieces on my mind, comin' together like lettuce
Dear God protect us 'cause we're mobbin' like 'GoodFellas'
Alias Carleone, maybe the war is on
Prone to let my daughter live rich before she's grown
If I murdered Capone, would you consider me a villain?
Chillin' with millionaires, ex-killers and set-trippers
My murderous complex begin to hit 'cha
Strip you worse than the New Jersey drive niggas
'Cause I'm in a rush to bust straps like Mack-10's
When I'm strapped in a '95 Impala
Breakin' like Vegas for my dollar
While I'm comin' like a hundred miles and gunnin'
Who gonna test the Southwest Connect
When it ain't shit that you possess?
Yes, we got the endo, splurgin' in Benzo's
Turnin' virgins to nymphos, look what 'cha in fo'
A G that's gonna let his khakis sag
Mr. Mike and Ice Cube, french braids and rags, byatch
How many wicked wayz can a gansta get his pays
When he's trapped in a maze?
I represent the phrase that say 'Crime pays'
Bitches, can we fuck? Niggas, can we blaze?
How many wicked wayz can a gansta get his pays
When he's trapped in a maze?
I represent the phrase that say 'Crime pays'
Bitches, can we fuck? Niggas, can we blaze?
I treat bitches like puppies, I got a plate full of guppies
Appropriate dish for the big fish, niggas rich
They have my straps, women with Gaps
Now, they wanna sit in my laps and listen to raps
But no, heard a nigga' tight named Mr. Mike
Had to catch a flight, it's only right
Stepped off the plane, Mean Green and Tony Draper
Killa was the caper, let's make some paper
See we can't get enough of this gansta shit
Sick as leukemia for weed in my gansta click
Let's take riches, witness two niggas dome in the killa' zone
Bring your killa chrome 'cause we headed to the Terrordome
When niggas never make it home
As long as you got your front I got your back, it's on like that
And like this, let the weed blow 'cause all you G's know
Who got the wickedest flow, the criminiminals
Now how many wicked wayz can a killa get his pays
When he's trapped in a maze?
I represent the phrase that say 'Crime pays'
Bitches, can we fuck? Niggas, can we blaze?
How many wicked wayz can a nigga get pay
When he's trapped in a maze?
I represent the phrase that say 'Crime pays'
Bitches, can we fuck? Niggas, can we blaze?
Say what? Niggas wanna short my cuts
Say what? Niggas wanna check my nuts
How you sound? Gangstas make the world go 'round
Guppies bow down, I'm with some killas from H-town
Chase his ass down to Atlanta, GA
Find out where he stay, locate my gate
Catch him in the hall, make his ass call
And then I want y'all to kill cousins and all
They won't believe all the heat I bring from Palm Springs
Niggas in line to catch the ring of the dyin'
Keepin' it calm, so talk slow
'Cause you'll never know when I'm ready to blow
I'm a pro of the lifestyle of the Bloods and Crips
Make a lotta cookies filled with chocolate chips
The Westside has always been down with the South
And suave mother fuckin' house
How many wicked wayz can a gansta get his pays
When he's trapped in a maze?
I represent the phrase that say 'Crime pays'
Bitches, can we fuck? Niggas, can we blaze?
How many wicked wayz can a gansta get his pays
When he's trapped in a maze?
I represent the phrase that say 'Crime pays'
Bitches, can we fuck? Niggas, can we blaze?
How many wicked wayz can a gansta get his pays
When he's trapped in a maze?
I represent the phrase that say 'Crime pays'
Bitches, can we fuck? Niggas, can we blaze?
How many wicked wayz can a gansta get his pays
When he's trapped in a maze?
I represent the phrase that say 'Crime pays'
Bitches, can we fuck? Niggas, can we blaze?
