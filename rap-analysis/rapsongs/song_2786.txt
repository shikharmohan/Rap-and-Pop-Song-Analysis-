Stay, a little longer
I know you have to go home to him
Yo boo, I want you to say, fall back
Put your slippers on, have a seat, give me your leg
I got the baby oil warmed up, Dreamgirls DVD
Stagger Lee swine could you stay mine pretty please?
I'm begging you, girl but time fly since 2 o'clock, boom
I turn around it's like 12 on the dot
What am I to do? Your steeze got a live nigga wanting you
Around the way girl, that's why I don't mind sporting you
Someone who loves you, only half as much as I do
Only half as much as I do
Aiyo, aiyo, he don't really love you like I do
Kiss your feet, make love to you like I do
Wake you up, in the night tank and surprise you
Cross my heart, swear, put my hand on the bible
I'm not a cold blooded killa, baby, I cry to
The best thing for me is when I'm laying beside you
Turn you over, open up, get up inside you
He a woman beater no doubt and he lies too
Stay, a little longer
I know you have to go home to him
When you leave I get aggy, I don't know how to act
The reality settle with a punch and a smack
When I know that you with him you ain't calling me back
It be that thing down there that got me way off track
Someone who loves you
Only half as much as I do
If it's like that, fuck that nigga, he a clown
He don't know what he got, let that bastard suffer
I sent you roses, Donna Karen bags from Paris
He can't match my one, son, he'll be embarrassed
Stay a little longer
I know you have to go home to him
Aiyo, baby, don't leave 'cause the club is popping
We got grandma yay, plus the tunes is knocking
On the dance floor, I'm sweating my ass off
Imagining us in deep lust how you look with your pants off
My one-two step, your dress is so spun
And your neck smell good, look cute when you chewing your gum and
From the womb to the tomb you're blessed with a killa walk
You don't have to give me none, it's aight, we'll talk
Someone who loves you
Only half as much as I do
