This is another Missy Elliot exclusive
I remember when yo ass was broke
So in love with me
You were always at home
Always talkin' 'bout
"Loan me this, loan me that, now gimme gimme"
And then ya got doe
And decide ya wanna leave
Gotta few chicks checkin' for ya now, huh
You forgot about me
Ain't it funny?
When ya man gets money
I bet you can't find him
But when he come home beggin'
You can't deny him
Where he at when you need him
He's out lookin cute
But when he need a few dollars
He knows where to run to
We would go out
I had to pay for everything
I never had to worry about you fuckin 'round
You used to tell me "Yea I love ya, no one above ya"
Then I bought you clothes
I made ya look like a king
Then the girls started flirtin' with ya ass, huh
And you forgot about me
Ain't it funny?
When ya man gets money
I bet you can't find him
But when he come home beggin'
You can't deny him
Where he at when you need him
He's out lookin' cute
But when he need a few dollars
He knows where to run to
I'll be the one you runnin' to
When yo pockets is low
And you out of cash flow
And the chicks don't want you no more
I'll be the one you runnin' to
When you got no more gas
In those buses, catchin' cabs
And the chicks don't see you no more
When ya man gets money
I bet you can't find him
But when he come home beggin'
You can't deny him
Where he at when you need him
But when he need a few dollars
He knows where to run to
