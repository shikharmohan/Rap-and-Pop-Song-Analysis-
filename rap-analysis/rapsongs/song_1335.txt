It's another one of them ol' phunky Cypress Hill things
You know what I'm sayin' ?
And it goes like this
Hey, don't miss out on what you're passin'
You're missin' the hootah, of the funky Buddha
Eluder of your fucked up styles
I get wicked, so come on
As Cypress starts to kick it
'Cause we're like the outlaws stridin'
While suckers are hidin'
Jump behind the bush
When they see [Incomprehensible] drivin' by
Hangin' out the window
With my magnum takin' out some putos
Actin' kinda loco, I'm just another local
Kid from the street getting paid from my vocals
Here is somethin' you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is somethin' you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is somethin' you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is somethin' you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is somethin' you can't understand
I'm ignorin' all the dumb shit
Yo, because nothin' is comin' from it
I'm not gonna waste no time
Fuckin' around my gat straight hummin'
Hummin', comin' at ya
Yeah, ya know I had to gatt ya
Time for some action, just a fraction of friction
I got the clearance, to run the interference
Into your satellite, shinin' a battle light
Sen got the gatt an' I know that he'll gatt you right
Here's an example, just a little sample
How I could just kill a man
One time tried to come in my home
Take my chrome, I said, "Yo, it's on
Take cover, son, or you're assed out"
How do you like my chrome
Then I watched the rookie pass out
Didn't have to blast him, but I did anyway
That young punk had to pay
So I just killed a man
Here is somethin' you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is somethin' you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is somethin' you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is somethin' you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
It's gonna be a long time before I finish
One of the many missions that I had to establish
To lite my spliff, ignite you with insight
So if you ain't down, bullshit
Say some punk tried to get you for your auto
Would you call the one time and play the role model?
No, I think you'll play like a thug
Next you hear the shot of a magnum slug
Hummin', comin' at ya
Yeah, ya know I'm gonna gatt ya
How do you know where I'm at
When you haven't been where I've been?
Understand where I'm comin' from
When you're up on the hill in your big home
I'm out here riskin' my dome
Just for a bucket, or a fast duck it
Just to stay alive, yo, I got to say "Fuck it"
Here is somethin' you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is somethin' you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is somethin' you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is somethin' you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is somethin' you can't understand
All I wanted was a Pepsi
