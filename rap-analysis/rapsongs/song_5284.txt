Oohh, uh, oh, it's time, Meth Man
G-Wine, aiy, aiy, aiy, aiy, aiy, aiy, aiy, aiy
There go the apple of my eye, my black butterfly
Don't try to pass me by like you do them other guys
You do with brother's lies, about they baby, mothers and their wives
And how you need their a** to survive
I ain't a bit surprised and I ain't try'nna give you bad vibes
You probably had a bumpy last ride witch ex
Was he stalking, calling making threats where you rest
Until you got that order of protect
Girl, I'm far from a threat, boo, now hold for a sec
Relax with the Meth, take a load off your b*****
If you had a choice, baby, who would you choose
Them dudes who look like they got sugar in they shoes
Girl, that's how you lose, before you play the game, know the rules
'Cause still ain't nothing changed but the jewels
You still paying dues, when we should be laying on the cruise
Some icecubes, playing with ya b****, know what I mean
Let's ride, we get it everyday, it's doesn't fail
And I always wanna know how you feel
'Cause you're everything, I'm always there for you
Yes, I'll be there, so let's ride
Let's ride, don't trip, got your back, I'm your man
I keep it G like they do it in the hood
And you give me everything, and always be right there
And if you real then let's ride
Hey, pretty ma, you look sweet, I mean
You the type of treat, I've been dying to e**
I see them other dudes try'nna speak, flossin' them jeeps
They wanna whistle and beep when you crossin' the street
Have mercy to these big hands and big feet
Use me once and use me again like fish grease
Body perfect, Prima Donna, oh my God, mommy, work it
Make a n**** wanna get a job
I love chicks to hate staring, hate man sharing
Hate it when a bum bitch is wearing what she wearing
Huge attitude like the size of her b*****
Double XL, she the 'Eye Candy Of The Month'
Johnny, but ladies call me Big John Studd
Is it my big c**** or my big long hugs
Go figure, if you got an itch, I'm ya nigga to scratch it
And bring the hook back while I'm at it, now pass it
Let's ride, we get it everyday, it's doesn't fail
And I always wanna know how you feel
'Cause you're everything, I'm always there for you
Yes, I'll be there, so let's ride
Let's ride, don't trip, got your back, I'm your man
I keep it G like they do it in the hood
And you give me everything, and always be right there
And if you real then let's ride
I start up on your right, peace and then we'll fight
I'm starting to fall for love, yes, I will, yes, I will baby
Don't need to think twice, I want you at your time
Ooh, tell me something
Let's ride, we get it everyday, it's doesn't fail
And I always wanna know how you feel
'Cause you're everything, I'm always there for you
Yes, I'll be there, so let's ride
Let's ride, don't trip, got your back, I'm your man
I keep it G like they do it in the hood
And you give me everything, and always be right there
And if you real then let's ride
Yeah, this is Ginuwine, uh
Method Man, yeah, I like that
