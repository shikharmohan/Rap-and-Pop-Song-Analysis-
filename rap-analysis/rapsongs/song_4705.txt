C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Nobody
You wanna do this again?
You sure?
Keep it right there
A lime to a lemon, lemon to a lime
'Cmon baby girl you gotta gimme mine
Whatever I do I'm garaunteed to shine
I wanna see if your pony is genuine
Better ride it right hi ho silver to the early light
(Early light baby)
Slow it down a bit get your face all wet drown in it
No doubt the opposite of '96
You turn me on sugar lick your lips
Girlfriend keep it right there
Face down with your hands in the air
Watch my rocks what's my M O?
Always hot
As for my flow?
It don't stop
Am I good to go?
Not my loss
Nobody can freak me like you
Nobody can freak me like you
Nobody can freak me like you
Nobody can freak me like you
Kitty kat ain't nothin' but skin and bones
You could flip it lick it or leave it alone
You could grip trick it to each his own
I'll make your manhood shine like chrome
What you could work me out
I told you my ex-man turned me out held me till I melt it down
Pound for pound I could freal 'em out lover zone
Unplug the phone
You were out when ya mom and I home
Stop I'll shut you down
Round and round, round and round
Work it out now c'mon here's your reward
All aboard
Word up you can't get up
I'll leave your black cherry all split up
Nobody can freak me like you
Nobody can freak me like you
Nobody can freak me like you
Nobody can freak me like you
Ooh all that drama sound real good I love to ride you
Wish you would
Yeah, but you won't call me back
Man can't take it when it's squeezed like that
I bite back re mat strike that a real live player won't do me like that
True what if I strip for you dance on the bed while you under my leg
Would you suck your fingers start to beg
Or crawl like a tiger and give me some head
Either way you can have it your way
Foreplay all day
A.K.A. John Mickens, so I won't be trickin'
We doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
But you ain't gettin' shit till I hear weddin' bells
Nobody can freak me like you
Nobody can freak me like you
Nobody can freak me like you
Nobody can freak me like you
Nobody can freak me like you
Nobody can freak me like you
Nobody can freak me like you
Nobody can freak me like you
