I am the resurrection and the life
He who believes in me, though he dies, yet shall relive
And whoever lives and believes in me shall never die
Shut up, bitch
Fear not them which kill the body
Rather fear Him which is able to destroy
Both body and soul in Hell
Get thee behind me, Satan and push me along
All this power I will give thee
If thou therefore wilt worship me
All shall be thine
Come with me bitch as we go through the door
Backwards, Heaven in art which Father our
Our Father which art in Heaven
Hey muthaphukka, see ya 'round, buddy boy
