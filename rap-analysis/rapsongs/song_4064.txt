Lil Wayne
My shorty knows what she doin, 
lick her lips then get straight to it
When she do it, I say oohh, feels so good, you so good, is so good, I'm so hood 
Take her to the block tell her don't even trip
Imma stop right here get a bag of dat piff , need to roll it on up and take that lift...
High my name is Wayne I came to get tamed, 
and a lot of other miscellaneous things
Stand up guy but came to laid, 
where's my bed and what I said is what I mean and u can take that to the head
I just come to do my thing gotta keep that man-eater fed, 
dreads swinging, while in banging, when I'm finished still hanging, 
yep I don't know she was thinking  but I'm young and I've been drinkin, 
now hop on in this spankin' new drippin wet Mercede coupe, 
got that thing lookin like a shining suit 
Now imagine that with me and you, 
I be Diddy you be Mase, 
Eat me up enjoy taste, I'm 5'8 wit it, don't be fake 
imma put it right there for you on that plate
Come on call me young, weezy baby baby ah-yes 
I'm ma ma mouthful know let me see you digest 
Nelly Furtado
And when she walks, she walks with passion
when she talks, she talk like she can handle it
when she ask for something boi she means it
Even if you never ever see it
Everybody getch necks to crack around
All you crazy people, come and jump around
You doing anything to keep her by your side
Because she said she love you love you long time
Chorus(2x)
Man-eater make you work hard, 
make you spend hard 
Make you want all of her love
She's a man- eater 
Make you buy cars
Make you cut cords
Wish you never ever met her at all
She's a man- eater make you spend hard
 make you spend hard 
Make you want all of her love
She's a man- eater 
Make you buy cars
Make you cut cords
Wish you never ever met her at all
