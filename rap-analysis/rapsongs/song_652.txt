Flow round by the wind
(Flowmotion)
Flow round by the wind
(Flowmotion)
Who is that ckun wit the tongue like the double edge sword?
Talkin' out the neck like we wouldn't push forward
But we murdered you *** and rap suckas, while you ***
And we leave our competition where there was none for us
*** got board back to the hood
With the thugs and fiends sold crack in the hood
Took my money and my trophies and my plaques to the hood
*** weren't goin' out Hollywood, not Bone
We keep it gutta thuggish, ruggish from the 99
My paper hustle been around the world a couple of times
Check the record, you can see I'm workin' double time
Give 'em something they can feel when I'm on the grind
Let the gangstas ride in the summa time
Shine real bright if you wanna get down
Let the top back slow, take a drag of the dro
Flippin' hard time now, you can burn that now
I flow when I go in flo' mo'
  (Flow)
I flow, flow when I go in flo' mo'
  (Round by the wind)
I flow when I go in flo' mo'
I flow, flow when I go in flo' mo'
  (Flowmotion)
I flow when I go in flo' mo'
  (Flow)
I flow, flow when I go in flo' mo'
  (Round by the wind)
I flow when I go in flo' mo'
I flow, flow when I go in flo' mo'

Try and keep up to the rhythm of the ***, really figga you handle
I'll make you an example, sample
When I stomp on these, some *** at random
Clear mother mend the anotha to get the phantom family
See me and I got to run in hood, while they run around
They comin' at cha wit a sound like thunder
Strike like lightin', hit 'em and they wonder where they at
Now all them thuggish, ruggish *** come from Bone, Bone
Never be anotha that can *** wit them Thug brothas
They all the same, they talk a lot but never got the balls to play
Better not look at all this weight
No not this way
But if they ever fizzle to the gristle
Blow the whistle on the Swizzle, it's official
And we back to get it crackin' in the middle of the action
We got you in flowmotion
I flow when I go in flo' mo'
  (Flow)
I flow, flow when I go in flo' mo'
  (Round by the wind)
I flow when I go in flo' mo'
I flow, flow when I go in flo' mo'
  (Flowmotion)
I flow when I go in flo' mo'
  (Flow)
I flow, flow when I go in flo' mo'
  (Round by the wind)
I flow when I go in flo' mo'
I flow, flow when I go in flo' mo'

Point your fist, pull your pistol, put ch'ya finger in the middle
I'am show you how to disrespect a issue, f***
Let me loose, *** a lawsuit, I gotta get 'em lay 'em up
Some where, we cap spinnin', you ain't get it
Hospital rehab
He alright, one to the chest, to the knee cap
I'ma keep it raw so you know you better back off
Swish said get 'em so you know we 'bout to bite chyaw
FS stepped up, fear when we roll up
Everybody roll up, everybody toast up
Get it twist a ***, pay attention to when you leave
Wit your grill-less and feelings hurt and shirt fulla dirt
***, we work wit witch-it
I'ma busta *** be first
Back again gotta be heard
Had an intermission but it's over
It's over, back the flowmotion on em'
I flow when I go in flo' mo'
I flow, flow when I go in flo' mo'
I flow when I go in flo' mo'
I flow, flow when I go in flo' mo'

I flow when I go in flo' mo'
I flow, flow when I go in flo' mo'
I flow when I go in flo' mo'
I flow, flow when I go in flo' mo'
