So, wide you can't get around it
So, low you can't get under it
So, high you can't get over it
I, can't get over it
Ready or not, here we come
Getting down for the one which we believe in
1993, much more bounce
Ice cube comin' with the half ounce
Not just knee deep, jeep fulla smog
Atomic dog
Like ya behind, heard it through the grapevine
How much longer will you be mine?
And I'ma tell ya, I don't like drama
So do I have to put my handcuffs on your mama
'Cause Bertha Butt did her damn boogie with her crew
But I'd rather boo you
And make you say humdrum, tweedee dum
Humdrum don't succumb when I'm done, buckin' hits
One nation under a groove gettin' down for the funk of it
Tear the roof of this mother like we did last night, son
And hit you with the bop gun
Here's my chance to dance my way
Out of my constriction
Gonna be freakin' up and down
Hang up really late
With the groove I only got
We shall all be moved
Ready or not, here we come
Gettin' down for the one which we believe in
One nation under a groove
Gettin' down just for the funk of it
One nation and we're on the move
Nothin' can stop us now
If you hear any noise, it's just me and the boys
Playin' with our toys
M-1, 'cuz everybody's gotta have fun
Under the sun, under the sun
So rough, so tough when I get down
The disco fiend with the monster sound
I wants to get funked up when I'm chillin', whoa
The bigger the headache, the bigger the pill in
You let her funk me 'cause my funk is the best
Comin' from the west
Kickin' that hits be occupied
Dedicated to the preservation motion of hips
Hittin' them dips, CD skips but I'm straight
As I bounce, rock, skate, now I'll toast to that
If it's rough, make the girls say, "Do that stuff! aw, do that stuff!"
But ya got to be, you got to be a freak of the week
For the top gun, hit you with the bop gun
One nation under a groove
Gettin' down just for the funk of it
One nation and we're on the move
Nothin' can stop us now
One nation under a groove
Gettin' down just for the funk of it
One nation and we're on the move
Nothin' can stop us now
Do not attempt to adjust your radio
There ain't nothin' wrong, so hit the bong
Waitin' on the double dutch bus for a ride
As the buffalo go round the outside
Put a glide in your stride and a dip in your hip
Got daytons on the mothership
And you can ring my bell if you need me to pass
The dutchie on the left hand side for the sale
'Cuz nobody knows where the nose goes when the doors close
Dog chow got the hoes
Lookin' for the theme from the black hole
May I'll big bang you with my black pole
So, flashlight, red light, we don't like cops on the bike
Just made bail, tonight
So whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna have some fun with the bop gun
Ready or not, here we come
Getting down on the one which we believe in
One nation under a groove
Gettin' down just for the funk of it
One nation and we're on the move
Nothin' can stop us now
One nation under a groove
Gettin' down just for the funk of it
One nation and we're on the move
Nothin' can stop us now
