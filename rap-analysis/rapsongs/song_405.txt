This Life

You don't want to live this life, no this life, it's not nice,
You don't want to live this life, no this life, it's not nice.

Nigga shot, hold on before you jump and just listen,
Take a second to straddle the fence, let me tell you about what you have been missin,
Ain't a damn thang, (damn thang), what you think the grass is greener,
Like a nigga just lost his first love, singing have you seen em talk the high beams,
Take some pipe dreams lookin for shit that really ain't there,
I'm a idious what you makin my nigga, you better just stay in your square,
And I'm here the Killas and Thieves, Pimps, Pussies is on the prawl,
If the find you out of your Element, they will pick you out of the crowd,
Thing to do is face the music, take a stand for your position,
Nigga get up, better stand up, man up in your position,
Never have no mercy for tnem niggas that is not applying themself,
So shit ain't perfect, so you gotta make it work for yourself,
You catch them coward niggas runnig duckin lookin for help, 
But the realest niggas in the game play they cards they was dealt,
Me myself i got some issues im not dealing with yours,
Everybody got they own drama rich or they poor.
(Chorus)
You don't want to live this life, no this life, it's not nice,
You don't want to live this life, no this life, it's not nice,
You don't want to live this life, no this life, it's not nice,
You don't want to live this life, no this life, it's not nice.

They give me 25 with the hell im in my jail sell, I feel like a movie
I get so whoosy from the stale smell, barely breathing hells air,
My first day here, i had to get down with a nigga that thought i was some kinda of faggot
I had to show him no hoes stay here, having to dieing is my main fear,
Why did i have to kill that man i should of never let my anger built, 
Now im in a state of awareness keeps me wishen i was thinkin should of reason i didn't really
mean to stop the world from breathen,
I was awake last night,
Real late last night,
Cause i heard some nigga screaming getting raped last night,
I did the crime but i wouldn't think about me do in the time,
These 6x9, is about to make me lose my mind,
Trapped in these closed walls, ain't have no conversation with my family on the outside, 
Cause they wont except my phone calls,
After a couple years of shedding tears,
My heart is stone hard, believe im ready for war with own God.
(Chorus)
You don't want to live this life, no this life, it's not nice,
You don't want to live this life, no this life, it's not nice,
You don't want to live this life, no this life, it's not nice,
You don't want to live this life, no this life, it's not nice.
(Wish Bone)
I've Been shot, grew up with out my pops,
In a hood ride blocks see niggas shot, got rid of them thangs in a place or not,
Cause i had to have it, new niggas lookin for where my stash at,
Watching my back, pullin out ready for niggaz that want to jack, jack,
Any case you could cant if you put in the work then you dreams is just like mine,
Wake up in cold sweats regrets about what i thought was lies, 
I could see me now do in that,
But i did it, relive it, the hood shows are no slacks, 
I believe is has nothing no, no coming back,
Makin money thinking you own that,
Just ridin threw the hood you might have to push your way back,
Guess its the money man, the beautifu-uh eeh-huh,
They say take ya home man
But damn i have got to watch my people,
You'll be happy cause one of us made it, not just him,
But damn everybody he ran with, where ya'll gettin money man, money man,
Right here,(Right here) damn, see how life is.
(Chorus)
You don't want to live this life, no this life, it's not nice,
You don't want to live this life, no this life, it's not nice,
You don't want to live this life, no this life, it's not nice,
You don't want to live this life, no this life, it's not nice.
