I'm not a nuttin' ass nigga, just down for my riches, I figure it takes
About a million or 500.000 tapes
To become officially gold or platinum status
That's why I'm always at this
Practise, in and out tha studio 24-7
My occupation, this is how I make my livin'
I get harrassed mostly everywhere I go
Can do my thing without a motherfuckin' popo
All up in my mix, 'cause I'm tryin' to maintain
And get a grip light weight fame
Born and raised in tha valley south Vallejo
The northern part of Cali, 'bout my mail
Struggle and strive all my life in a world of grief
Sucker motherfuckers wanna knock me of my feet
But I'mma keep on steppin' and gettin' bigger
I'm not a nuttin' ass nigga
I'm not a nuttin' ass nigga, just down for my riches
Not to long ago I'm off to the bank to cash my cheque
The lady teller wouldn't give me no damn respect
She started acting hella snotty, kinda prejudiced
I guess she didn't like the way that a nigga was dressed
Before I could even get my foot in the door, right
The bitch already had a brother like me stereo-typed
Ready to push the button with no delay
I said wait a minute, baby, you mistakin' me for Andre
I'm not a rat head wanna be
I wouldn't rob a fuckin' bank for publicity
I get it honestly, legally so have no fear
I make more in a week than you do in a year
Straight out tha geto, hillside resident
Sick wid it records and tapes and I'm the president
So don't go thinkin' that every brother is out to get ya
I'm not a nuttin' ass nigga
I'm not a nuttin' ass nigga, just down for my riches
Sometimes my language is vulgar, lotsa profanity
I try not to trip when kids parents
