Grand hustle movement
Yeah
We get it poppin' on site
I'm sure you already know my steno
See, I've never been a buster
Just a true hustler, my squad is lethal
You come with the right price
I can make you look bigger than Neno
Just put a gun in your hand
And let you ride with the man
'Cause I'm a muther fucking hero
In my time
Just to make sure, he don't get it clear
Like Pellegrino from Acseno to a kilo
I'm a neighborhood hero
They be talking love
But they never seen a key though
Never chop them 63's down to triple 0
Hate on me so much
But I'm what you wanna be though
Might of went triple platinum
You ain't never been a G though
I keep the 50 with me
Tote it 'round like it legal
Fly like a seagull
Ride around with 3 girls
Keep it pimpin' with me
You don't want to see those
So what we can meet up
You get your ass beat up
The reason people honor me
Is the reason why you under me
You don't believe we run the street
Well, come and see, nigga
We get it poppin' on site
I'm sure you already know my steno
See, I've never been a buster
Just a true hustler, my squad is lethal
You come with the right price
I can make you look bigger than Neno
Just put a gun in your hand
And let you ride with the man
'Cause I'm a muther fucking hero
In my time
I'm the man that's apparent
Even when I'm running errands
Gotta beat a Mc Claren on what
I'm wearing got 'em staring
Bitches I share 'em if they in my hair 'em
They ain't getting high, well, I don't go near 'em
Nigga wanna die, tell 'em buck I dare 'em
I ain't gonna spare 'em, homie, I'm gonna tear 'em
Apart from his heart to his ass swear to God
Give a fuck about his partner
Give a damn about a charge
I take it too far, pull up wherever you are
Empty clips in your new car
Picture you dead and zoom off
Admit it you lost, probably 'cause shawty to raw
You flaw ay tell 'em how we do dawg
We get it poppin' on site
I'm sure you already know my steno
See, I've never been a buster
Just a true hustler, my squad is lethal
Come with the right price
I can make you look bigger than Neno
Just put a gun in your hand
And let you ride with the man
'Cause I'm a muther fucking hero
Got a box of ammo that I rarely use
9 millimeter that shine like shoes
Hope the day never come when a nigga have to
Let it go on the bust and hope it ain't you
'Cause I be on deck, on the grind like sex
Taking over local city street like feds
Breaking down every nickel, every dime, every brick
Down to the last dollar, I mean every bit
We get it poppin' on site
I'm sure you already know my steno
See, I've never been a buster
Just a true hustler, my squad is lethal
You come with the right price
I can make you look bigger than Neno
Just put a gun in your hand
And let you ride with the man
'Cause I'm a muther fucking hero
We get it poppin' on site
I'm sure you already know my steno
See, I've never been a buster
Just a true hustler, my squad is lethal
You come with the right price
I can make you look bigger than Neno
Just put a gun in your hand
And let you ride with the man
'Cause I'm a muther fucking hero
In my time
