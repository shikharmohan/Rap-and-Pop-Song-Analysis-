So hot, hot
It's the S the L the I the M
Let me tell you
What I wanna do
Let me show you
That I'm feelin' you
Wanna sex
Wanna ride with you
Wanna taste
Wanna put my lips
All over you
Can't get enough of you
Always taken of you
So sweet
So very wet
So good
Girl you make me sweat
Girl I'm talkin' 'bout
Chorus 1:
Peaches and cream
I need it 'cause you know
That I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in
My Bentley limousine
It's even better when
It's with ice cream
Know what I mean
[repeat 2x]
(Jay-Z)
You know the whole repituior U.s
to the U.s.s.r attention in the lexus car
match wits with the best of ya'll
the rest of ya'lls it's like vegatables
and my presence check it
remanescent of nothing you have ever heard
then i realize that it didn't make sense there
backtrack show me where the cash -- cash, cash , cash at
I never thought
That I would be
So addicted to you
On top, underneath
On the side of you
Better yet baby
Inside of you
Love the way you're
Just flowin' down
And I can feel
It all around
In the front, in
The back of you
Ooh, I love
The taste of you
Girl you know
What I'm talking about
[Chorus 1, 2x]
(Lil' Kim)
Kim got'em in the zone
beatin' their dicks
even got some of these straight chicks
rubbing they tits(ha,ha,ha)
What? i am lovin' this shit
 Queen Bitch, what bitch do you know
who could thug it like this?
Imagine if i was a dude,
and hittin' cats from the back
with no strings attached, yea nigga
Picture that, cause ya'll niggas ain't shit
Won't stop girl you know
I can't get enough
Wanna taste it
In the morning
When I'm waking up
Like peach cobbler
In my stomach
When I eat it up
Got your legs
Around my neck
So I can't get up
See the boys 112
We from the A'
(A'-Shorty we don't play)
And when it comes
To eating peaches
Shorty we don't play
So all the ladies in the house
If your peach the shit
Put your hands in the air
Represent your clique
[Chorus 1,2x]
Chorus2:
Oh girl I need it
I gotta have it
It's always on my mind
Know what I mean
Peaches and cream
I like it in my car
Or even in my bed
Or baby on the stairs
Know what I mean
Peaches and cream
[repeat Chorus 2]
[Chorus 1, 2x]
