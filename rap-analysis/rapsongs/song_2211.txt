I flipped a Lexi, speed up and catch me
Lexus of Concord, reached out and touched me
Some of you hoe fake ass niggas like Roz, be messy
I know some beautiful black intelligent women, they're sexy
E-40's back and actin' black and
I don't be barkin', nor even high cappin'
You better watch me, I'm comin' smebbin'
Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven
Bet your persodian, 30-R-6-castodian
Special shout to Casual Del the Souls and opium
About the town, the Valley-Joe
Just like a democratic, I'm for' the po'
Fuck the bumble, you bitch it ain't no punk hoe
Pedestrian stumble sound like a gorilla tryin' to get up out of a trunk hoe
Continue strikin' it, hope you likin' it
They'll be makin' nasties at the bus stop and trackin' it
Every egg that I pull in bulges
When it comes to spittin' I'm ferocious
Management in cabbages, Savages
Hangin' out when all the sudden I'm eatin' ham sandwiches
All day, everyday, 40 play, he say
She say, bieetch! That-a-way
Keep it goin though don't stop
Shakin' baking soda, forms a rock
36 zips on a triple beam scale
Burn the duct tape but keep all the ya-yo
Rip a peel, extra crisp, really really
Ate it like I'm a specialist
Drisidrisomina is the illest zaggin'
Thinkin' I put 'cause like this you know I'm puzackin'
In the mornin, cookin' bacon
From the ghetto in the bullet-proof apron
Here comes the laws, valium crushin' through my balls
I rip my drawers runnin' from the canine cocaine-sniffing dogs
Some niggaz hate me, some niggaz love me
Some niggaz shake my paw, some niggaz mug
I see ya tweakin', I see ya peekin', y'all bootches with me
Why you sleepin'? A motherfucker ain't gotta be Flash Gordon
Always runnin' up the backstreets in a batch that having a hoe
Protect The shit, won't work that batch just wants your scrizzach
Lettin 'em know, preferred Zodiac sign Scorpio
See the breeze soldier, V A L L E J O
Never show witness to your
Never leave your crib with out your pepper, beeotch!
I'm tryin' to get nigga ritch
Open up a shop cotton candy and licorice
Cash in stashes, that's a must
We leavin' with a million and that's a plus
Don't get it twisted, man, don't try to find me
Might be in Switzerland, or Hawaii
1 2 3 40, wheels new shoes scrappin toe to toe
Crack blackjack and Keno, strike sideways hit Reno
Ball cappin, no smilin' sittin' lo somethin' profilin', beeitch!
Fuck the bumble, you bitches it ain't no punk hoe
You clits it ain't no punk hoe
