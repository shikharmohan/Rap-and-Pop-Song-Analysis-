Listen to the lyrics we are the one's prophesied to return
My main concern is for all of you to learn
How to live, yes through the lyrics I give and send my friend
This age is coming to an end
Not the world, but the age is ending, ending
Listen to the astrological message I'm sending, I'm sending
Truth is truth, whether or not you like me
We are living now in the Age of Pisces
But Pisces is over, at the year two thousand
When the Sun of God, changes his house and
Enters the Age of Aquarius
The Sun of God as man is hilarious
When you think of Jesus, think of the Sun
The flaming Sun, that's where they stole this concept from
Stop believing and read your Bible logically
The New Testament is really old astrology
Jesus is the Son of God no lie
But they might be talking about the Sun up in the sky
The Sun, that hangs on the cross of the zodiac
The zodiac with twelve signs to be exact
Each sign is a house, and you should keep in mind
Each house equals, a period of time
The time, two thousand years and that's a fact
It's called an age or a house in the zodiac
The twelve disciples, are twelve months of reason
The four gospels signify the four seasons
When Jesus fed the multitude with two fishes
It signified the Age of Pisces, not fish on dishes
If you read the Bible astrologically it's clearer
The next age will be the age of the water-bearer
It's called the Age of Aquarius
When logic and truth will take care of us
So in this age, of spiritual dignity
You'll see a rise in femininity and creativity
Meshed with masculinity, you got to get with me
This is your true her-story
Do you wanna go higher?
