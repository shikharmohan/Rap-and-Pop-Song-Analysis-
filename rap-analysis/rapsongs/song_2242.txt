Charlie hust', busta bust', let's do it
He, he, he, he, flip mode, sic-wid-it
You know what's best for you, you better get widdit
I heard him talkin' but then he walkin', now tell me why
They never been incarcerated in a correctional facility
For doin' this kinda street chemistry
(Hell yeah)
I'm an original rapper, retrospected by plenty, hated by people
Me, 40, we took it back as street soldier
You got my back I got your shoulder
Peas and toes, tryin' to make it, it's all oh's
Impossible is a hit never get caught diggin' in my nose
Ex d-boy used to be a big time neighborhood rock star
Although I never owned a guitar
I, uh I'm lyrically inclined with my start stutter scrilla
Type delivery, 40 and busta rhymes, was drinkin'
And smockin' hickory, on the porch one time
When I came up with this line, I was perkin'
Off of some of that Carlos Rossi wine, what cha playa patnah got
Flows, like a Latina female orgasm
Hoes, be yellin' and screamin' causin' contractions at my
Shows, they take off they clothes and throw they pantyhose on stage
Any applicable age from dookie braids to Suki braids, deal widdit
Do it to me baby, do it to me
(Do it to me baby, do it to me baby)
Just do anything you want to do to me
(We go do it, do it, do it)
Do it to me baby, do it to me
(Do it to me baby, do it to me baby)
Just do anything you want to do to me
Just do anything you want to do to me
(We go do it, do it, do it)
Check it out yo, do it to me I'ma do it to you
Rubber you glue, bounce off of me I stick it on you
Weather whatever you could never ever measure my pleasure
Dig in my treasure, be making your lungs cave in together
Blow smoke out my face, pick up the pace
Speed up the race, never let a hot joint go to waste
My dogs will bark when your marksman trespass
You better use caution, your body parts might get auctioned
No need for you to keep stalkin', hell but what you talkin'
Have you dusted like a zombie lookin' straight Christopher walken
Shorty tried to call me and warn me and E-40
About these other corny rappers that ain't got nuttin' for me
You know they all blew it, time to move it
Blow the spot you knowin' how we do it, capitalize
Upgrade to gold now we platinum eyes
Keep my flavor holy sacred and pasteurized, what
Do it to me baby, do it to me
(Do it to me baby, do it to me baby)
Just do anything you want to do to me
(We go do it, do it, do it)
Do it to me baby, do it to me
(Do it to me baby, do it to me baby)
Just do anything you want to do to me
Just do anything you want to do to me
(We go do it, do it, do it)
We doin' this to blow through it till you suffocate, losin' your breath
Till you satisfied, you know we do it to death
Ay, you know we do it to keep you flippin', do it for whylin'
Doin' it for me to get my hustle on, do it for profilin'
Do it for the love affair because I'm lovin' it
When we clubbin' all you hear is the live DJ rubbin' it
Runnin' it all into the ground, doin' it for days
Do it for money, know I gotta keep my bills paid
My reals be pokin' and stickin' out like nipples
The felines, be lookin' at us like we some Popsicles
Busta rhyzimes and Charlie hustle or should I say fonzarelli
Poppin' they collars and workin' they star jelly
Up in the club, order the one, the party's just begun
Love, batches outnumber the fellas ten to one push come to
Shove, forgot my gun but it won't hurt fool
My music come up out the woodwork, beatch
Do it to me baby, do it to me
(Do it to me baby, do it to me baby)
Just do anything you want to do to me
(We go do it, do it, do it)
Do it to me baby, do it to me
(Do it to me baby, do it to me baby)
(We go do it, do it, do it)
Do it to me baby, do it to me
(Do it to me baby, do it to me baby)
Just do anything you want to do to me
(We go do it, do it, do it)
Do it to me baby, do it to me
(Do it to me baby, do it to me baby)
(We go do it, do it, do it)
Do it to me baby, do it to me
(Do it to me baby, do it to me baby)
Just do anything you want to do to me
(We go do it, do it, do it)
Do it to me baby, do it to me
(Do it to me baby, do it to me baby)
(We go do it, do it, do it)
