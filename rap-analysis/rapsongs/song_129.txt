(Gun Shots)
[Chorus Akon]
Oooo 
Don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood.
Ain't nothing changed still holly at my homiest.
Oooo
And when I hit the block I still will kill.
And i don't want to, nigger but i will if i got to kill
If niggers get the fucking around(Yeah).
If niggers get the fucking around.
[50 cent]
Respect come from admiration and fear.
You can admire me or you can catch one in your wig.
See the testosterone the toast is right on my lap.
So if a nigger get out of line a nigger get clapped.
I got a arsenal an infantry I'm built for this mentally.
Thats why I'm the general i do what they pretend to do.
Front on me now nigger I'll be the end of you.
Forget your enemies and think of what your friends will do.
I drop a bag off, they let a mag off.
That had lock will tear half your ass off.
I'm not for the games I'm not for all the playing.
The hollow tips rain, when I unleash your pain.
Get the message from the lines or get the message from the nine.
Paint a picture with words you can see me when I shine.
Put my back on the wall nigger watch me go for mine.
I let 21 shots off all at the same time (yeah).
[Chorus Akon]
Oooo
Don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood.
Ain't nothing changed still holly at my homiest.
Oooo
And when I hit the block I still will kill.
And I don't want to, nigger but I will if I got to kill.
If niggers get the fucking around(Yeah).
If niggers get the fucking around.

Where I'm from death is already in the air homier.
Nana love me so you know she say my prayers for me.
I come creeping through the hood wearing' Teflon.
Hit the corners motherfuckers get left on.
Niggers know if not they better check my background.
Try to stick me I'll fill your back with mack rounds.
Ask prime nigger 50 don't back down.
I keep it funky like fiends in the crack house.
Cross the line boy I'm a air ya ass out.
Screw your face at me I wanna know what thats about.
Nigger I know you ain't mad I done came up.
And if you are fuck you cause I ain't change up.
The OG's wanna talk but I don't know these niggers.
And I ain't did no business with em I don't own these niggers.
A minute of my time I did it cause I grind.
All across the globe like the worlds mine(yeah!).
[Chorus Akon]
Oooo
Don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood.
Ain't nothing changed still holly at my homiest.
Oooo
And when I hit the block I still will kill.
And I don't want to, nigger but I will if I got to kill.
If niggers get the fucking around.
If niggers get the fucking around.
[Akon]
convicted
Now tell me have you ever looked up in the distance.
And seen a mack aiming at your head man (head man).
Before you know it life is flashing Decreasingly.
And your body is dripping and full of lead man (lead man).
I done been there (uh-huh).
I done copped that (uh-huh).
But it ain't never been a question about that (uh-huh).
Don't go there (uh-huh).
You'll get clapped at (uh-huh).
And if ya play me fuck around and re-route that (uh-huh).
You'll never catch me riding around on these streets.
Without a couple metal pieces under my feet.
Fully automatic whippers in the loaded with doom d's.
Stash under the carpet like a can of sea breeze.
50 don't make me ride on these niggers (ay).
Cause I will kill dip and hide on these niggers (oooohhhhh).
50 don't make me ride on these niggers (ay).
Cause I'll be long gone like the ripper (soooo).
Chorus Akon
Don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood.

Oooo
And when I hit the block I still will kill.
And I don't want to, nigger but I will if i got to kill.
If niggers get the fucking around.
If niggers get the fucking around.
