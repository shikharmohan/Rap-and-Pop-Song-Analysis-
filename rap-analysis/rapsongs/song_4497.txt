Yea, real rap, real rap for ya
Lighters up, lets get 'em
Though, though I'm missin' you, I'll find a way to get through
I know livin' without ya is impossible
Gone I know you gon' live on 'cuz you were my brother
And I love ya, and I miss ya
Stay strong, be tough, that's what the preacher tell ya
He never really felt ya, so he can't even help ya
Need a shoulder to lean on, somebody to cry to
It's like everything's gone but I'm a survivor
Standin' on stage in front of thousands
Don't amount to me not havin' my father
That's real talk, I know a lot of y'all got 'em
But you need 'em way more when you gotta go without 'em
And I'm without 'em, but that's life y'all
Sometimes you gotta learn to swim with no lifeguard
I'm alright God, shit I'm still breathin'
But lose hurt like bullets, I'm about to start bleedin'
Throw me down some comfort, 'cause my heart need it
Tryin' to cope wit my chances and meet 'em
There's a dark road ahead, but I'm tryin' to take it easy
Rest in peace Lil Beezy, my nigga
Though, though I'm missin' you, I'll find a way to get through
I know livin' without ya is impossible
Gone, I know you gon' live on 'cuz you were my brother
And I love ya, and I miss ya
Though, though I'm missin' you, I'll find a way to get through
I know livin' without ya is impossible
Gone, I know you gon' live on 'cuz you were my brother
And I love ya, and I miss ya
Smoke cush all day and pop painkillers
Fuck who don't understand it, this what the game did us
This what the streets showed us
This how the block made us, the same block where they layed 'em
I pray every time I cross the spot on the pavement, save me
Lord will I be next for the taking? Take me
I know I'm livin' like I know when I'm comin'
But I'm just livin' 'cause I know that it's comin'
And the end is comin', but I ain't runnin'
I and hidin' and duckin', I'm in the middle of a war, I'm alive and love it
I'm just speakin' from the heart of the dyin' public
We still beatin', we gon' rise above it
Though it seem like they cheatin' and we loosin'
We survive if nothin', they could never take the stride from strugglin'
I gotta ride and sometimes that ride get bloody
But I just think about my buddy and go after that money, but uh
Oh, we gotta get over, we gotta get over, gotta get over
It's almost over, and we gon' be alright
Straight Patrone out the bottle to the head now
We gettin' read now, bitch my nigga dead now
And all the things I never said, I gotta say it now
I shoulda said it then, now I gotta talk to clouds
Now I gotta walk around, brim down
Just tryin' to find my way to the next day, escape
Ya birthday could be ya death date
So I'm livin' like it was just yesterday, let's pray
Ten fingers together, can't bring 'em together
It's murda murda, I don't think it get better
So be a competitor or get out the weather
Me? I got a umbrella and a berretta
I'm just tryin' to make sure my daughter future progressin'
And behind that, I'm shootin' excessive, trust me
The beautiful dead, we livin' wit the ugly
I just tell my pops wait for me, I'm comin'
Though, though I'm missin' you, I'll find a way to get through
I know livin' without ya is impossible
Gone, I know you gon' live on 'cuz you were my brother
And I love ya, and I miss ya
They ask me why I wear shades at nighttime
'Cause I don't wanna see nothin' yea
Like I said, life ain't nuttin'
But a long extended road, keep drivin'
I done passed up plenty people
Up on the side of road, no help, keep goin'
Yea, lost a lot of passengers on the ride, kept goin' yep
Who knows when I'll run outta gas, yea
