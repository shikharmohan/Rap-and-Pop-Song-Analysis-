I increase my throttle, uplift my shuttle
Tribe in a huddle, pilot on auto, bro
I'm not a role model, more like a psycho
A Bates type of 'Psycho', cut you like Michael
'Halloween' character or computer wizard
Hit you with the blizzard, cut your circuit with my scissors
Shorts'll get crossed while you're in the crossfire
You get blasted, you dumb ass bastard
See you need the data, better I say data
You're lookin' at the Tribe an' you're a hater
Comin' from inside, means I come better
Or should I say rather together I'm gonna set ya
Head in the casket, your body in a basket
A tisket, a tasket, I told ya I'm gonna blast ya
When I'm on the psycobeta state of mind over magnum
You know I'm gonna tag them
You're gonna get funked when I buck ya down
You know you're gonna get funked when I buck ya down
You know you're gonna get funked when I buck ya down
What you're runnin from is the psycobetabuckdown

It's a psycobetabuckdown
Psycho, alpha, disco, beta
Somebody's gettin' bucked down
See, I'm from South Central, bustin' out my metal
Rapid-fire petal, funk is makin' me get mental
Yo, it make no sense, [Incomprehensible]
Sen start the massacre, as I get nasal
The phase'll be like a murderer's maze, yo
You won't find B-Real, inside any kind of cage, yo
Sen is the gangsta, me, I'm just a pimp
Broads swingin' off my dick like a chimp, simpin'
So what's the story, you come lookin' for me?
Better just scatter or you're gettin' leaded
I'm the one who said it, boy, it doesn't matter
You're gonna get splattered, with my funky ill juice
'Cause I'm 'The Phuncky Feel One'
Makin' you get real loose
My intellect, dialect, dialog, intellect
Catalog from what you want me to select
Different forms of beta, psycho for alpha
The way I stay in control of myself
I'm not one of many penny ante on the gauges
In the stone ages, make minimum wages
Show me where the stage is, I come to get the brain on
Hey, man, get the fuck off the 'caine, bro
You're gonna get funked when I buck ya down
You know you're gonna get funked when I buck ya down
You know you're gonna get funked when I buck ya down
What you're runnin' from is the psycobetabuckdown
