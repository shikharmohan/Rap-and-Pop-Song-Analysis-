Oh, I got the intro along with the cash flow
Make all the bad boys seem like nymphos
Yeah, I'm hard, I get sexy like Veronica
A sexin' instrument like the philharmonica
No, I ain't tall but I'm small and I'm slender
Ask him who's been in, shit is like tender
If he didn't like it, return to sender
He didn't do that, it's too fat, he remembers
Never ever, have I ever said I was good lookin'
Just one bad ass bitch from Brooklyn
Not here to steal your loot, your coat, your rocks
Makin' niggas drop whenever we hit the block
They hear Brooklyn, and we up to no good
Well, here we come, so there goes your neighborhood
Timbos scuffed up, sess bein' puffed up
Mess with the wrong one, kid, you get ruffed up
Peace to my people in
  (Brooklyn, Brooklyn, Brooklyn, Brooklyn)
Peace to my people in

I got the rhythm that'll rip up shows, blow down foes
They kill at will to get a taste of my flow
Vocally I rock, locally and worldwide
Those that got bad wish they woulda never tried
'Cause when you come from where I come from
You gotta be tough
'Cause niggas'll call your bluff quick enough
'Cause if your hood is like my hood, you gotta think quick
Shit stink, niggas are slick, have you turnin' tricks
I gotta give it up to Mr. Cool J
For givin' up the props to the girls around the way
It ain't safe after dark to throw a jam in the park
If you wanna get naughty, bring your forty to the arc
'Cause we get down when it comes to a jam
Just watch your back pocket, keep a eye on the man
If your town is like my town, you don't wanna mess around
Wind up gettin' bagged up, beat down
Peace to my people in
  (Brooklyn, Brooklyn, Brooklyn, Brooklyn)

Everywhere that I step they know my rep
'Cause I'm sayin' and doin' ill shit they won't forget
Breakin' down doors, although I never break laws
Come to a town that's yours and I be rippin' the whole tour
Comin' hard for your section, slow up
Live in the flesh and about to blow up
So yo, come down, and then get the fuck up
Looks are hooked, you lucked up, you're booked
You gotta be hard 'cause I ain't with softies
Hit, then you miss, gotta get offa this
So come with your game 'cause you can't be lame
As soon as you walk, I'm forgettin' your name
As long as you know all that enter are equal
Straight from the Lyte I send peace to my people
