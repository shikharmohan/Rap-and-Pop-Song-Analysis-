We got our own thang, we got our own thang
We got our own thang, we got our own thang
We got our own thang
We got our own thang, we got our own thang
We got our own thang, we got our own thang
Everybody, shake your body, we don't ill, we chill at party
Keep a groove that's sensual, three-dimensional
Unquestionable the lover is professional
Got a category, my own and I'm the president
Don't be a monk but you're summoning up the resident
With my particular style, style, particular
Extracurricular, smoother and trickier
Throwing on lyrics like you throw up a flapjack
You're a Chicken Mc Nugget and I'm a Big Mac
Brainstorm soloist, have a Coca-colaist, doing very well
Because it took the right road to this
Path, make the undertake, the record breaker
Get up on the floor and do the Heavy D shake
Started with a pow and I'm going to end with a bang
We've got our own thang
We got our own thang, we got our own thang
We got our own thang, we got our own thang
Picture the set, girlies wet with sweat
In the corner people sitting down
They've had as much as they could possibly get
Here while I'm lamping, feeling like a champ
Push up on a cutie phone digits I'm stamping
The place was packed though, stuffed like an Oreo
Everybody broke for a Heavy D video
Pumping in stereo, people said, "Here we go"
A cutie down in front said, "Heavy, you're my hero"
Understand this, before you make a comment
Because there's always a meaning in a Heavy D statement
In this life, I strive for improvement
Be your own guide, follow your own movement
Loving is a legend, me, I'm legendary at it
Living on the mike makes me a rapping acrobat
Don't try to swing, because you couldn't even hang
We got our own thang
We got our own thang, we got our own thang
We got our own thang, we got our own thang
Original, individual, smooth criminal
Dance a lot, dance a little, shuffle to the middle
Don't clock anybody, let them all clock you
Don't be down with anybody, let them all be down with you
Stay self-managed, self-kept, self-taught
Be your own man, don't be borrowed, don't be bought
Started with a pow and I'm going to end it with a bang
We got our own thang
We got our own thang, we got our own thang
We got our own thang, we got our own thang
We got our own thang, we got our own thang
We got our own thang, we got our own thang
We got our own thang, we got our own thang
We got our own thang, we got our own thang
