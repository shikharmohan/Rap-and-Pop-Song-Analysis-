wayne im all you got on this rap shit man
ha, once again its on my respect lovin now its unheard of
niggas was laughin now they wish they never heard of em
now they gonna learn to respect me bro
that nigga shot 9mm getting burned in yo retina
had that leg come out the back of yo head
one word is what i said click, clack and your dead
put one more of them claps in the back of your leg
i hit ya, arm, leg, leg, arm, head
damn, if you was just a version of pain just think of me as the r&b; version of wayne
but since he doin the same thing now theres no difference
ice grill hood niggas put your dentures in
he's so sweet make her wanna lick the sanga
so me and weezy gang bang her
pullin on my roots i had to hang her, whip her, tallahassee dick her
im back on the map cause
(Chorus)
he rap (he sang), and he do (his thang), and he does (we does)
everything you wish you was its t-wayne (t-pain)

he rap (he sang), he do (his thang), he does (we does)
everything you wish you was its t-wayne (alright)
