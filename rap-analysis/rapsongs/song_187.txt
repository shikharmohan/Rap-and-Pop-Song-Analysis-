Yeah, 50
I gave her books to read, fed her mind with knowledge
Gave her street smarts, shit, you can't get in college
She's a reflection of me 'til you know she the shit
If I'm a star, she a star, If I'm rich she rich
That's my dog
I tell her stay she wanna go, I tell her go she wanna stay
That's my dog, you a bitch
Don't usually mean nothin' to me, that's right
But that's my dog
I go left, she go right, I go up, she go down
She couldn't listen that, she ain't around
So ungrateful, screamin' I hate you
She must got amnesia, bitch I made you
Now, just think, just think that could've been you
Just think, that should've been you
Yeah, with me, I share the world with you
But you ain't ride with a rider so I ain't fuckin' with you
Say, say, say girl, come here
No, you, no, her, yeah, you, go
The reason you didn't get picked
Because you got your nose up your ass like you're smellin' your shit
But tonight you met your match
'Cause I be smellin' my shit too, now how you like that?
You could've had this dude and anything you choose
And now girl you lose 'cause I ain't fuckin' with you
Could've been you
Shoppin' sprees, drop top hair blowin' in the wind
Could've been you
Livin' lavish instead it's your girlfriend
But you trippin' while we sippin' in the back of the club, big tippin'
Some say it hurts when you supposed to win, then you lose
You were supposed to be sure, baby you was confused
I had a thang for you, I had a ring for you
House, cars, kids and a pet and name for you
Pussycat told you I make it, you ain't believe
I guess 'cause comin' up was hard, it was easy to leave
Now think about it maybe I'm right maybe I'm wrong
Either way shorty, life goes on
When you around, my smile's a grin, my thoughts are a sin
You ask me can we try again, I ain't fuckin' witchu
It's on, the club jumpin', I'm tryna get my liquor and
You wanna suck the dick again, I'm starin' at your thicker friends
I guess I'm like Will Smith in 'Pursuit of Happiness'
In my hood, we all hustle and in pursuit of the same shit
Now just think, just think that could've been you
Now just think that should've been you
With me I share the world witchu
But you ain't ride with a rider, so I ain't fuckin' witchu
Say, say, say girl, come here
No, you, no, her, yeah, you, go
The reason you didn't get picked
Because you got your nose up your ass like you're smellin' your shit
But tonight you met your match
'Cause I be smellin' my shit too now how you like that?
You could've had this dude and anything you choose
And now girl you lose 'cause I ain't fuckin' with you
Could've been you
Shoppin' sprees, drop top hair blowin' in the wind
Could've been you
Livin' lavish instead it's your girlfriend
And it ain't no other way to put it except
I know you understand it girl, it's so
But you see us in the back of the club
Poppin' bottles and it could've been you, but nope
Said it could've been, could've been you, yeah
Said it could've been, it could've been you
