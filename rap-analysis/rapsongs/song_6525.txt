Get up and oh party, yeah
Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me
Groovy baby, sing a song, get up and, and party, ooh, come on girl
Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me
Can't you hear what I hear, that's the sound?
Of the voice that you haven't heard in a while
It makes you wanna do the bumpin'
I'm starvin', I went and got Marvin
I see the rap game is just arguin'
And at times, I'm the main target
Hey yo Marvin, what you feel about it?
And what you think your nephew Snoopy Snoop should do about it
Get up and oh party, yeah
(Snoopy party, party Snoopy)
I wanna sing a song, get up, and party
(Together at last)
Baby come on, come on, girl
It's a party over here
But I don't really know what the party is a go
'Cause they trippin' at the front door
Let it go, slide in slow
But I really don't know
'Cause I'm tryin to hit the dance floor
And then I'm gonna go to the motel
Hands in the air 'cause you know I don't care
Hey yo Marvin, what you feel about it?
And what you think your nephew Snoopy Snoop should do about it
Get up and oh party, yeah
(Snoopy party, party Snoopy)
I wanna sing a song, get up, and party
(Together at least)
Baby come on, come on
(And party, yeah)
Get up and ohh party, yeah
(Sing a song, get up)
Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me
(Yeah)
Groovy baby, sing a song, get up, and party
Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me
No matter where you at
If you white, if you black, if you don't like me
This is somethin' to groove to, to move to
Made to move you, ensue you, Snoop do
What I do, keep it true, and ball through
What I make may can take years on you
Hey yo Marvin, what you feel about it
And what you think your nephew Snoopy Snoop should do about it
Get up and oh party, yeah
Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me
Groovy baby, sing a song, get up and, and party, ooh, come on girl
Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me
Get up and oh party, yeah
(Snoopy party, party Snoopy)
I wanna sing a song, get up, and party
(Together at last)
Baby come on, come on, girl
Baby come on, come on
(And party, yeah)
Get up and ohh party, yeah
(Sing a song, get up)
