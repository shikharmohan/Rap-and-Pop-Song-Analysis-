It's the Diggy Diggy Doc, y'all, pumpin' it yes, y'all
D.O.C. on the system, we kick it fresh y'all
Lettin the bass thump on and strong and hard for PPP
Engineerin' the cut is E Double E
Yo, it's the Diggy Diggy Doc
Y'all, yo, yo yo, when I hear a bass
This goes out to my niggaz and you all bitches
The Benzes, Range Rovers and sixty-four switches
The C.I.A., Feds and even dogs sniffin'
I plant a bomb right by the bar when it starts kickin'
Doc stompin ground, Brick City hound, what?
Guerrillas out the jungle get gritty now, what?
I'm walkin' barefooted over loads of hot coal
Cuts from the snot-nose, keep your barbershop closed
When it goes, Flex don't have to drop the bomb on it
I keep my speech, bleek, and my right mind on it
So when it's time, I'm heard in the streets
My mammal animal skin, excitin' all the birds in your Jeep
I'm crazy nigga, when I was young
I spread and shaved both legs to my babysitter
Ran into Bebe's Kids in a baby pickup
Shot up Toys R Us and robbed Kay-Bee, nigga
This is def poetry far beyond my control
Fuck your teflon, be body-armed like the toll
Unload from my girbauds and make it hot for homey
I puff so much of that green, I bleed guacamole
It's like Shaq and Kobe, I be for four quarters
Callin' veterinarians to get the dogs off ya
'Animals Attack-Part Four', people starin'
I'm not the type of Focker that'll go and 'Meet your Parents'
I'm outside trick or treatin', fuck if my chick is cheatin'
I'm hungry as fuck and I hope you niggaz sick of eatin'
It's like the fourth letter, tenth letter, third letter
Chicken hawk, bird-getter, holla if you heard better
I got a chick with no ass at all
I fuck her for the love of that money, not basketball
And when my man comes home, and the Def Squad is back
Yo, give me that rap game, we'll take charge of that
