Better believe---- it cause it is co --- min ------  
 You wan't believe the site you see before eyes ---  
 You wan't believe the site you see before eyes ---  
 [Black Thought]  
 
 Then enter the zone where our patrolers will get round cold soul  
 Just push the panic button on your remote control  
 Diddly Bo leave for feelin a saga foretold  
 Who got caught pon the block for gold got the old  
 Heads froze - they peepin outa closed windows  
 They not secure as they supposed I watched it all unfold  
 Well this another episode with titanic panoramic view is dismantle  
 depressin um - load with this gun hold  
 Guns traded for sensi and hash crack for ass  
 Wild like a sun sold for cash  
 Entire crews pass not making the news flash  
 Brews pass a memory and spark not to blast  
 Whatever have transform to the war path  
 Pure wrath from north down to 24th and Task  
 Games store the half the niggas you were prayin the streets  
 Tainted with camoflouge - guerilla sabotoge  
 My cousin's da ratatard was livin tight large  
 So many so called hearts scared they burried in the yard  
 Got caught then blast crashed off on Broad and Lambar  
 Lick shots at Babylon de one comfy bombard  
 Kids run far from traditional credit cards scams  
 Veterans is nipped in the butt with large plans  
 Stick up kids is jumpin outta played the Dodge Rams to jam  
 You and your man it's mad drama and -  
 [CHORUS]  
 
 
 This is for all of my niggas that are RIP  
 I pass a car soon you know who's the enemy  
 You ain't missin of life ain't what this should be  
 Lots of shit has changed and it's kinda fucked up to see  
 Yo I'm fast for the buck do anything for the cream  
 You remeber Top C nigga think slice of dream  
 Never seen a case like this although it's quite contageous  
 He even got his little bother actin all outrageous  
 >From dusk to dawn and from dawn back to dusk  
 They do anything and everything tryin to come up  
 It's kinda sicknin how the cash is so fucking addicted  
 Ain't nothin but a contradiction in this world we live in  
 And when I say some bout they say that that's conflicted  
 Cause the loot is for the takin and not for the givin  
 Then ya got this world well I say I'ma die hustlin  
 Fuck everybody except my brother who I'm trusted in  
 I guess the couple just did not know the truth  
 Cause the following week I seen threw him of the roof  
 And sometimes I wonder what the fuck I think about that  
 But I guess that's how it goes when there ain't no more rap  
 How nowadays kids get whap for somethin less than a pat  
 Thought he was his borthers keep but fuck all that  
 Americas worst nightname guns against hands  
 [CHORUS]  
 Niggas causin mayhem from the p.m.'s to a.m.'s  
 
 
 It was the year a 84 I was tryin ta get in the mix  
 The year the niggas roll with sheepskins kitcells and kicks  
 Even got the patten leather Adidas snatched of your feet  
 Man that talk is cheap the cripled can't walk for weeks  
 The first sto was word to Penn and Teller's  
 Strolled in the dollar house parties and search for Cinderella  
 Was just a little man real bold  
 Tryin to act grown and old so da respect can be shown  
 A Hip Hop a little copped in and break dancin'  
 When niggas wore wind breakers plot to take lamb skins  
 Remeber Zigglers? Uptown the bottom to Natrona and  
 St. Charles in South Phil the ooh mob gang  
 H-R-M Ogontz Ave. Brickyard to hollow  
 Niggas was snatchin gazzeles and flippin pockets for tha dallo  
 And niggas from Logan came to extort we know tha game  
 You run ya little wolf chain in West Oak Lane  
 You proclaim this gangster bullshit talk  
 And never even seen your man shot a bodies in charge  
 Aggravated assualt another weekend in the precinct  
 Take everybody for their ring man that's how we think  
 Back then you catch a sucker punch off guard  
 Niggas will pull you card tryin to walkaround all hard  
 Niggas quick to flip your pockets if you lip service  
 When you see fifty niggas deep with scully's get nervous  
 It ain't no tellin what they could do to you  
 So you clutch up thinkin you knowin you gettin stuck up  
 In another episode in my area code  
 It's another episode in my area code
