Eminem - Life
Life, by Marshall Mathers,
what is life?
life is like a big obstacle, in front of your optic wanna slow you down,
an every time you think you've gotten past it its gonna come back,
around and tackle you to the damn ground,
what are friends, friends are people that you think are friends,
but they really your enemies with secret identities,
and disguises to hide they' true colours, so just when you think you close enough to be brothers,
they wanna come back and cut your throat when you aint lookin,
what is money, money is what makes a man act funny,
money is the root of all evil,
money'll make them same friends come back around,
swearin that they was always always down,
but it's life...im tired of life, im tired of backstabbin' ass snakes with friendly grins,
im tried of commitin so many sins,
tired of always givin in when this bottle of hennie wins,
tired of never havin' any ends
tired of havin' skinny friends so full on crack and many things,
im tired of this Dj, playin your shit when he spins,
im tired of not havin a deal, tired of havin to deal with this bullshit without grabbin the steel,
tired of drowin in my sorrow,
tired of havin to borrow a dollar for gas to start my monte carlo,
im tired of motherfuckers sprayin shit an dartin off,
im tired of jobs startin off at $5.50 an hour, then this boss wonders why I'm smartin off,
tired of being fired every time i fart and cough,
tired of havin to work as a gas station clerk for this jerk breatin down my neck, 
drivin me beserk,
im tired of using plastic silverwear 
tired of workin at buildin square,
tired of not being a millionare,
but if i had a million dollars i'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alchoholics,
if i had a magic wand, i'd make the world suck my d*ck without a condom on,
while im on  the jon,
if i had a millions bucks, it wouldn't be enough, cos i'd still be out robbin armoured trucks,
if i had one wish, i would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss,
im tired of being white trash, broke an always poor,
tired of taken pop bottles back to the party store,
tired of not havin a phone, tired of not havin a home to have one in if i did have one on,
tired of not drivin a BM, tired of not workin at GM, tired of wantin to be him,
tired of not sleepin without atylanol PM,
tired of not performin in a packed collessium,
tired of not bein on tour,
tired of f*ckin the same blonde whore,
after work in the back of a contour,
im tired of fakin knots with a stack of ones, havin a lack of funds, an resort back to guns,
tired of bein stared at, tired of wearin the same damn nike air-hat,
tired of steppin in clubs wearin the same pair of luggs,
tired of people sayin they're tired of hearin me rappin bout drugs,
tired of other rappers who aint bringin half the skill as me sayin they wasn't feelin me or no-bodies as ill as me,
and I'm tired of radio stations tellin fibs tired of J.L.B. sayin we're hip hop lib's,
but if i had a million dollars i'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alchoholics,
if i had a magic wand, i'd make the world suck my d*ck without a condom on,
while im on  the john,
if i had a millions bucks, it wouldn't be enough, cos i'd still be out robbin armoured trucks,
if i had one wish, i would ask for one big enough ass for the whole world to kiss,
you know what i'm sayin? im tired of all of this bullshit,
tellin me to be positive, how am i supposed to be positive when i don't see shit positive,
you know what i'm sayin?
i rapp about shit around me, shit i see,
you know what i'm sayin?
and right now i'm tired of everything,
tired of all this, player hating that's going on in my own city,
you can't get away or play, 
you know what i'm sayin',
but hey, it's cool though,
you know what i'm sayin'?
i'm just fed up, thats my world
