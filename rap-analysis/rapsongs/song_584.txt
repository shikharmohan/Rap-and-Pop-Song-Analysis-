Lately you've been stressin' me, that's when I'ma give you some
Callin' me, jockin' me, sweatin' me, gonna rush me none
'Cuz when the time is right I'm gonna let you know and, that's for sure
So wait on me, patiently, and see what I got in store
I'm gonna represent, to the fullest of it and I promise you no regrets
Just put you trust in me, and baby, I promise this shit is legit
(Legit, legit, legit)
It's all good
(Yup, yup, yup, it's all G double O D, good, good, good)
It's all good
(Yup, yup, yup, it's all G double O D, good, good, good)
(With me, with me, with me)
It's all good
(Yup, yup, yup, it's all G double O D, good, good, good)
It's all good
(Yup, yup, yup, it's all G double O D, good, good, good)
(With me, with me, with me)
If I told you once, then I told you twice, you've got to get to know me
There's more to a relationship, then jumpin' in the sheets
And if that's all you want, then you better go, 'cuz that ain't me
I don't give me love to just anybody
If I'm not correct, then prove me wrong and, just hold on
Gradually you'll see, just how good it'll be
When the time is right, I'll ease your mind with a little bump and grind
Fantasies full of ecstasy, we'll have a real good time
It's all good
(Yup, yup, yup, it's all G double O D, good, good, good)
It's all good
(Yup, yup, yup, it's all G double O D, good, good, good)
(With me, with me, with me)
Since it's all good baby, we can get it on
Hey, you wanna ride? Krayzie Bone
Come and jump in the Benz and tell your friends
That you will get with them later
Come and let me take ya, got a couple of things I wanna show ya
I'm really tryin' to know ya, I'm just curious
Is it really all good? You serious
(I'm serious)
If it is, then I gotta jump on it, ride it, ghetto cowboy
Surprise, you thought I was quiet, I never was shy baby
Niggas just act like that
Lay back, but don't let that Buddha rule ya, give that nigga the bag
'Cuz we won't have time to talk
I've been peepin' for a minute now
(Yep, yep, yep)
And I know just where I'ma start
Let me listen to your heart beat, boom boom
Racing intense situation, is it gettin' kinda hot it here?
No, that's you
Temperatures are rising, so am I
It's all good
(Yup, yup, yup, it's all G double O D, good, good, good)
It's all good
(Yup, yup, yup, it's all G double O D, good, good, good)
(With me, with me, with me)
It's all good
(Yup, yup, yup, it's all G double O D, good, good, good)
It's all good
(Yup, yup, yup, it's all G double O D, good, good, good)
(With me, with me, with me)

(Yup, yup, yup, it's all G double O D, good, good, good)
It's all good
(Yup, yup, yup, it's all G double O D, good, good, good)
(With me, with me, with me)
