[T.I talking]
Damn, has it been that long? (haha)
Say what happens since I been gone
They got the game all wrong, it's too pretty in here
Let's say we take it back to the trap one time
[Chorus]
I went from rolling wit' dem rocks on the block
To controlling my position at the top
Of every chart I will not, stop
(We ride, and we roll, man you stop) Yeah we go, yeah we go
(hey, hey, hey)
(yea you know, yea you know, yea you know, yea you know,
Yea you know, yea you know)
Girl we ride, man we roll, and you stop,
And we go, and we go (go)
[Verse 1]
In the middle of a fight, I'm so cool
Everybody want it hot I go through
All of this half of which would have broke you
Came out smelling like a rose even more true
Worldwide, bi-coastal, global, nigga's I respect posted
Cause I get it don't mean they do too
Cause I ain't got a damn minute ain't no 'tude
You know we never not goin all in
Kickin doors over just to let my dogs in
So many rides never catch a nigga walkin'
In a G-5 tryna put a bunch of broads in
Then we landin' laughin'. chicks with fantastic asses
Extravagent habitats, if you never seen tragic happen (hey)
Make magic happen with cash I'm actually catchin magic
In the market for lavish mansions 'n NBA expansions
I was passin out Phantoms and old folks sold that dope
Way past respect you see, but I neva as big as a nigga felt a beat ya see
[Chorus]
I went from rolling wit' dem rocks on the block
To controlling my position at the top
Of every chart I will not, stop
(We ride, and we roll, man you stop) Yeah we go, yeah we go
(hey, hey, hey)
(yea you know, yea you know, yea you know, yea you know,
Yea you know, yea you know)
Girl we ride, man we roll, and you stop,
And we go, and we go (go)
[Verse 2]
So fly why would I wanna land for
Everything you could ask for and more
Your choice, you could even be a fanboy
Hate to see a nigga get a hundred grand more
Bein' a motherfuckin' man, won't stand for
The rap wars, always goin' back and forth
Livin' in a blood killing like cancer
But when getting brain, thats for damn sure
Get more friends, universal get more seaweed
The same people on tour, on TV
They signed him shoulda kept your reciept
Get a refund cause you sure can't see me
Who keeps CD's on repeat, stuck in MP3's for 3 weeks
At the gates on the day I was released
The only time you will ever see me free
Big money J, much as you can get for it?
Atlantic records say just make another hit for me
I tell 'em cut a hundred million dollar check for me
Like it or not, don't lose no respect for me
Never mind what I did, cause the best commin'
I'm the king in a game like chess to me
So put the cash in tha bag,
Give the rest to the attendant puttin' gas in it...
[Chorus]
I went from rolling wit' dem rocks on the block
To controlling my position at the top
Of every chart I will not, stop
(We ride, and we roll, man you stop) Yeah we go, yeah we go
(hey, hey, hey)
(yea you know, yea you know, yea you know, yea you know,
Yea you know, yea you know)
Girl we ride, man we roll, and you stop,
And we go, and we go (go)
I got a new swag and it's a new day
Here we go again too, what it do 'J?
I'll give you a call, I know the way you used to move yay
Now I gotta new Audemar with a blue face
Hoppin' up in G4 jet no suitcase, whole new wardrobe in a new place
Chain close superstain if a stain on my shoelace
T.I. roll like sushi... touche.
If ya can't lay back, who the hell am I?
Bringin' homocide to the gang, no alibi
Can't tell a lie to the judge, I'm guilty
Your Honor do you mind the guy tried to kill me
I could still be, in a trap now
AK 'round, little yay 'round
100k downstairs by the trey pound.
But if they wonderin who runnin the A yeah you know..
[Chorus]
(Yea you know, yea you know, yea you know, yea you know,
Yea you know, yea you know)
Girl we ride, man we roll, and you stop,
And we go, and we go (go)
Yeah you know that we ride
In control we don't stop
We gon blow where we drop
Let you know we on top
Girl we ride, man we roll, and you stop,
And we go, and we go (go)..
