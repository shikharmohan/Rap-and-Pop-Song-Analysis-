[Lil' Kim - Talking]
See it's two types of bitches in the world
You gotta broke bitch, you gotta rich bitch
That would explain what I am
And what my girl Missy is
We da rich motherfuckin' BITCHES!
That's right
Then you got a bitch like me
Who just stand above all bitches
That excludes my girl Missy, Mary
You know what I'm saying
But ya'll know what the fuck I mean
I'm the Queen Bee-itch
That's right motherfucker what?
Ya'll gotta problem wit' it come see me
A motherfucker ain't taking my title
Or my girl Missy title or my girl Mary title
What, that's right you see
Only bitches like us are allowed to play a game a chess
A real queen needs a king
You damn motherfuckin' I don't nigga laying under me
That I can't do for me what I can't do for my motherfuckin' self
So when ya'll see me in the street
This is what I want ya'll to do
*Beat starts*
Fix your lips, put 'em together nicely and say
Say it along, say it along now
Say "She's a BITCH!!!!"
[Missy - Singing]
I was walkin' real slow to the dancefloor
He was lookin' at my ass and I turned him up
I see him talkin' to his boy on his cellaphone
I looked at him and all he could say was
"Damn baby, bring it on"
I talk shit but I come thru like a storm
I keep my piece so sweet yeah nice and warm
And all he could feel was this "Love baby"
I don't give a fuck
About what they think
What they say
They can call me a freak
Call me anything they wanna name
I don't give a, I don't give a
I just wanna take him home
Take him to the house
And turn 'em him
He ain't checkin' for you
I don't give a fuck
About what they think
What they say
They can call me a freak
Call me anything they wanna name
I don't give a, I don't give a
I just wanna take him home
Take him to the house
And turn 'em him
He ain't checkin' for you
