Hot, fire, hot
L! Who bring you the hotness?
L! Yo, you don't wanna start with
L! Forever keepin it locked
It's now time to rock with L! Throw your L's up
Don't ever under estimate Jack the Ripper
Be clear, every time he reappears, it's sicker
Listen here, the mind expanded, the vision is slicker
I'm long range like a miss-ile, many styles to getcha
Tear ya out the frame so the hood can get the picture
But I'd rather break bread, kick knowledge and get some money witcha
I'm willin' and able, to smooth pounds out like witch hazel
The legend is real, I'm not a fable
Captivated the screen, I'm Queens' Clark Gable
If it ain't a joint, bet your label, don't put it on the table
I'm out for the moolah, throw better hooks than David Tua
Who's the nicest? L, you are
L! Who bring you the hotness?
L! Yo, you don't wanna start with
L! Forever keepin it locked
It's now time to rock with L! Throw your L's up
L! Who bring you the hotness?
L! Yo, you don't wanna start with
L! Forever keepin it locked
It's now time to rock with L! Throw your L's up
You don't want it with L, b'ship cats will get banged out
Put your flow throw a filter boy shake the old slang out
23's in the building, watch my tongue hang out
Makin' M C's scatter like multiple shots rang out
Day one since I came out, they can't put the flame out
My temp seizin', perfect reason to blow the game out
Skatin' off in the navy, naw baby you can't have me
But I know cats will pay for that 'n lace ya - yeah, gladly
Warning, young rappers, you don't want a career?
Y'all wanna keep goin' platinum, y'all don't wanna disappear?
Stop boppin' backstage like you causin' me fear
'Cause you startin' to get on my nerves, and that's a problem
The vet's in here
L! Who bring you the hotness?
L! Yo, you don't wanna start with
L! Forever keepin it locked
It's now time to rock with L! Throw your L's up
L! Who bring you the hotness?
L! Yo, you don't wanna start with
L! Forever keepin it locked
It's now time to rock with L! Throw your L's up
Tension on the mic, halftime highlights
L boogie bangin' on 'em, jumpin' through the skylight
You stand corrected, I'm hot, so get it riddight
I'm just spittin', when the mid dick is gripped, I spit it tiddight
Aight? Oh, these various rappers is so hilarious
Who put the mic down but y'all ain't qualified to carry this
Your tracks are garbage and bars are miscellaneous
So, throwin' your joint at my car was spontaneous
Oh! I can't take it, why, must they fake it?
Flows is fully dressed, yours is butt naked
Forever I will be, the one they came to see
Blowin' mic's in half baby, who else could it be but
L! Who bring you the hotness?
L! Yo, you don't wanna start with
L! Forever keepin it locked
It's now time to rock with L! Throw your L's up
