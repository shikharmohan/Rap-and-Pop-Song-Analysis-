Hey you get off my cloud
Let me get raw with my southpaw style
Mover, puffin' on a fat blunt from Cuba
It's the Meth Tical jet to Cal, I'm the Buddha
Monk on the hunt for machine gun foes
I keeps you open like a slug from the shotgun punk
Double-barrel, yeah Meth bring it to them proper
Partner, you ain't got no wins in Mi Casa
Straight up, you movin' too fast so baby wait up
Took one, added seven more, now you eight up
Get on down wit' your bad self

I break it down, I get down for my crowd
[Incomprehensible], dirty like a worm underground
[Incomprehensible] early bird, that's my word
Before I kick the bucket, I'm a kick 'em to the dirt
Check out the cloud, smoke out from the mouth
Other brothers got mad love for new style for the hood
Hey enter the square if you dare without a fro, I'm so raw that I'm real
I'm goin' to the country, I'm goin' to the fair
To see the Senorita, with flowers in her hair
And get mine, 'cuz she love me long time
Bartender bring more wine
Get in line for the

Here I am, here I am, the Method Man
Wu-Tang, killer bees on the swarm
It ain't safe no more

1993 to '94, the rugged raw
It's our secret, never ditch the Wu-Tang
