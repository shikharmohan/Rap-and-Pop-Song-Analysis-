Another day, another dolla for the top Dogg with the gold flea colla
Nigga, make the whole Dogg world wanna holla
The way they do my life and I'm steady tryin' to do more right
So trife, your life could disappear
And if you ain't careful who you fuckin' with, nigga
Now reappear, come here, come near, so you can hear what I spit
So sick and tired of niggaz standin' on that "G" shit
Just because you on starz with some khakis
And think your rap style can out rap me and now jack me
Come here nigga, slap yo' self
That's probably why yo shit still sittin' on the motherfuckin' shelf
And mine sold out ever since it came out
Blue carpet roll out, No.1, no doubt, mo' clout, down south, mixin' it up
With dem niggaz that don't never hesitate to bust
What you niggaz tappin' on my front door for?
Oh, you lookin' for yo hoe?
We in the hotel room doin' the zoom
And let me let you know nigga my heat goes boom
And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
I'm back on the scene, chopping green
Captain on the team, call me commissioner nigga, so just listen up
Look like you bored and our boy's bridges
He hangin' with dem niggaz but dem niggaz straight bitches
Left a nigga hangin' at the club when it was scrap time
Then a week later gave him a shot on in a rap line
Now they in a New York rap time
Rapper turned snitch, now you livin' on a main line
Money's too tight to mention but let me mention
When dem niggaz in da kitchen find out he's snitchin'
They gon' get him and when his homies find out he's snitchin'
9 times out of 10 dat nigga gon be bitchin'
You know what? Transformin' is switchin'
And oh yeah, informin' is snitchin'
But I ain't one to tell you ain't heard it from me
I'm just a MC tryin' to stay super free
And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Look here fool, I know this game in and out
And quit tryin' to tell me 'bout dem niggaz down south
Don't try to slide with that west side love shit
That dove shit eat a dick, bitch
I can can read you from the giddy
I read you, I took you to my home and I fed you
And led you upstairs to a room with 37 niggaz
That was strapped up hatin', waitin' on you
Nigga, you the victim, we don't pick 'em
We just stick 'em and when once we get 'em, we got 'em
We try to rid the streets of creeps and freaks
Like you for all y'all snitches and bitches
We gonna do the world a big favor
'Cause niggaz like y'all be fuckin' up the gangsta flavor
And oh yeah, it ain't no west coast thang
'Cause niggaz out of town got birds that sing
And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Breakdown, breakdown
Top Dogg, No Limit, yeah, LBC
