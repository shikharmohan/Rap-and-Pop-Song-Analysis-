God gave me style, God gave me grace
God give me style, God give me grace
God put a smile on my face
God put this smile on my face
God make me shine like the sun
God make me shine like the sun
Sometimes I feel like I'm the one
Sometimes I feel like I'm the one
It ain't my fault, I just reach for style
I'm hot, I breaks it down
It ain't my fault, you can't break it down
The way I break it down
Listen, you can call me what you want, black an' ugly
But you can't convince me the Lord don't love me
When my CDs drop, they sell the best
You call it luck, why can't it just be I'm blessed?
I'm a track star runnin' through life, chasin' my dreams
Best deal I made was tradin' the mic for that triple beam
I zone off thinkin' is there really Heaven or Hell
If so what happens to a changed man that dies in a cell?
I need no answers to these questions 'cause time will tell
Got a date with destiny, she's more than a girl
Don't much good come from me but my music
It's a gift given from God, so Imma use it, yeah
God gave me style, God gave me grace
God give me style, God give me grace
God put a smile on my face
God put this smile on my face
God make me shine like the sun
God make me shine like the sun
Sometimes I feel like I'm the one
Sometimes I feel like I'm the one
It ain't my fault, I just reach for style
I'm hot, I breaks it down
It ain't my fault, you can't break it down
The way I break it down
Some days I'm in the crowd, all by myself
Bunch of niggaz around, I'm still by myself
I drift off on a cloud by myself
Thinkin' 'bout nothin' more than life, what else?
These days it's hard to tell who really cares for me
So when you hear this song, you should say a prayer for me
I put a message in my music, hope it brightens your day
If times are hard when you hear it, know you'll be okay
A O.G. told me, "God's favorites have a hard time
You're out the hood, that's good, now stay on the grind"
I'm a sponge, knowledge an' wisdom, I absorb fast
I'm in a class by myself, you do the math
God gave me style, God gave me grace
God give me style, God give me grace
God put a smile on my face
God put this smile on my face
God make me shine like the sun
God make me shine like the sun
Sometimes I feel like I'm the one
Sometimes I feel like I'm the one
It ain't my fault, yeah, shout out to Reverend Floyd Flake
It ain't my fault, Creflo Dollar, CD Jake
Ms. Chevetti Allah, is here shorty, feels good
Oh yeah, can't forget Bishop Moore 'cause my mama key on me
