Common ft. Bilal "Black Maybe"
Hook 
Can't come around
They gon wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind
Black maybeÃ¢Â¦Ã¢Â¦Ã¢Â¦Ã¢Â¦
I heard a white man's yes
Is a black maybe
I was delivered in this world 
As a crack baby
Hard for me to pay attention 
And I act crazy
Gotta get over from the tip 
I watch the fat lady sing a song
On how we guerillas in warfare
And I'm the kingest kong 
They say we dreamin wrong
Them same strips that them older cats lingered on
Now the walgreens is gone
Hope is killed fiends are born
We leanin on a wall that ain't that ain't stable
Its hard to turn on the hood that made you
To leave be afraid to the same streets that raised you
Can aid you. What other black births came suit
the rage up in harlem and the southside
Brothers is starving with there mouth wide open
Floating across state got the work got plans so they can move weight
The fate of the black man, woman, and child maybe 
Hook (2x)
Cant come around
They gon want to bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind
Black maybeÃ¢Â¦Ã¢Â¦Ã¢Â¦Ã¢Â¦
He had game since he used to hoop at chattum
Neither the ghetto nor defenders could trap him
The stones had his back and they'd pat him
He was living a life they couldn't fathom
Colleges getting at him with all type of scholarships
Even if he went they knew he'd  leave college quick
For the pros the one from the hood that was chose
The black rose that grew in the jungle
But humble stud still had rumble in his blood
Women all around giving him trouble love
You know the love when you up they down
Cause you wrap a ball they round 
Your wind is their clown
Dudes in the circle he known for years
Shared biz and cheers but chose different careers
when paper and fame came they ain't know how to react
Them same studs shot him in the back 
Now that's blackÃ¢Â¦.maybe
Hook (2x)
Can't come around
They gon wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind
Black maybeÃ¢Â¦Ã¢Â¦Ã¢Â¦Ã¢Â¦
[Common Talking]
When we talk about black maybe
We talk about situations
Of people of color and because you are that color
You endure obstacles and opposition
And not all the time fromÃ¢Â¦.from other nationalities
Sometimes it comes from your own kind
Or maybe even your own mind
You get judgedÃ¢Â¦you get laughed atÃ¢Â¦you get looked at wrong
You get sighted for not being strong
The struggle of just being you
The struggle of just being usÃ¢Â¦black maybe
Hook 
Can't come around
They gon wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind
Black maybeÃ¢Â¦Ã¢Â¦Ã¢Â¦Ã¢Â¦
