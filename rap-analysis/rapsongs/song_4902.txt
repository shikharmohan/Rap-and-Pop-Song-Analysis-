I'm the MVP, I'm stupid with this rap shit
Here I am, yep, I'm the man, word
Here I am, yep yep, I'm the man, word
Here I am, yep, I'm the man, word
DTP's about that bomb shit, Luda
When Premier puts the needle on the record then I put it on blast
Your flow is garbage, I throw it in the trash
I'm the MVP, I'm stupid with this rap shit
Rewind the verse, make the track do a back flip
Your speakers poppin' on a handstand
They sneak dissin' niggas, throwin' little jabs like Bam-Bam
And I'm a bad man, they amateurs like at Apollo
I wipe 'em off the stage like Sandman
Damn man, what the hell you smokin' on?
It's Ludacris I got more cheese than Provalone
And the chrome is home, so I'm never home alone
And only keep friends with two X chromosomes
So I command all these rappers put the mic down
Throw a grenade in your mouth, nigga bite down
'Cause I'm back with Premo on the track
Takin' it to the essence showin' niggas how to rap
Here I am, yep, I'm the man, word
Here I am, yep yep, I'm the man, word
Here I am, yep, I'm the man, word
DTP's about that bomb shit, Luda
Still hungry as the day I began, I heat the booth up
So much the engineer caught a muthafuckin' tan
I'm the truth when it comes to it, I hold hip hop for hostage
Since two thousand I put a gun to it
And I run through it like a Jamaican boat
And everyday is a vacation on Jamaican smoke
Charge your whole block, talk shit they hear the four pop
One, two and it don't stop
And my deliveries invaded your vicinity
Hennessey is my remedy, takin' shots like Kennedy
And I've been a G for a long time
To these streets I'm connected like I'm online
On time for whatever
And every time and album drop, I drop big like Voletta
I'm ahead of the competition, they wishin' I just fade off
My career for your life, let's trade off
Here I am, yep, I'm the man, word
Here I am, yep yep, I'm the man, word
Here I am, yep, I'm the man, word
DTP's about that bomb shit, Luda
Eight years in the game, ain't a damn thang change
So I brought it back to one of the tracks so where the damn thang came
And he goin' down in history 'cause he don't sleep
And he the first southern rapper on a Premo beat
I hate the kick and the snare
The samples always taste fine
And I shoot a hot sixteen from the baseline
I'm on point like CP3 and I'll be goin' down in rap as the MVP
Here I am, yep, I'm the man, word
Here I am, yep yep, I'm the man, word
Here I am, yep, I'm the man, word
DTP's about that bomb shit, Luda
