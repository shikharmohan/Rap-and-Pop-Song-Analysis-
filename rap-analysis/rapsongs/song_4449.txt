When They Come For Me Lyrics
[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Tell Them Boys I'll Be Here When They Come For Me
Me And Every Single Nigga That Got Love For Me
See I Got Money On My Mind
But The Haters Wont Leave Me Alone
So Im Ridin Everyday With Every Pistol That I Own
Tell Them I'll Be Here When They Come For Me
Me And Every Single Nigga That Got Love For Me
See I Got Money On My Mind
But The Haters Wont Leave Me Alone
So Im Ridin Everyday With Every Pistol
Everyday With Every Pistol
