Hold up, so what you're saying is, oh
  (Niggas got me pissed like Lil' Kim)
You want to get freaky again, aright
A-ooh-ah-ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I've been a lot of places, seen a lot of faces
Ah hell I even fucked with different races
A white dude his name was John
He had a queen bee rules tattoo on his arm, uh
He asked me if I'd be his date for the prom
And he'd buy me a horse, a Porsche and a farm
Dan my nigga from down south
Used to like me to spank him and cum in his mouth
And Tony he was Italian
And he didn't give a fuck that's what I liked about him
He ate my pussy from dark till the morning
And called his girl up and told her we was boning
Puertorican papi, he used to be deacon
But now he be sucking me off on the weekend
And this black dude I called King Kong
He had a big ass dick and a hurricane tongue
How many licks does it take
Till you get to the center of the? 'Cause I've got to know
How many licks does it take
Till you get to the center of the? Tell me
How many licks does it take
Till you get to the center of the? Oh, oh
How many licks does it take
Till you get to the center of the? Oh, oh, oh
This verse goes out to my niggas in jail
Beating their dicks to the double X L
Magazine, you like how I look in the aqua green? Get your vaseline
Grow some weave with some tissue and close your eyes
And imagine your tongue in between my thighs
Baby open up cell block eight, alright nigga that's enough
Stop, look and listen, get back to your position
Kim got your dick hard start fights in the yard
I'm hotter than a pop tart fresh out of the toaster
Niggas do anything for a Lil' Kim poster
Eses, bloods, crips, all the thugs up north in the hole
They all wanna know
How many licks does it take
Till you get to the center of the? Tell me
How many licks does it take
Till you get to the center of the? Tell me yeah
How many licks does it take
Till you get to the center of the? Oh, oh
How many licks does it take
Till you get to the center of the? Oh, oh, oh
If you driving in the street hold on to your seat
Niggas grab your meat while I ride the beat
And if you see a shiny black Lamborghini fly by ya
That's me the night rider
Dressed in all black with the gat in the lap
Lunatics in the street gotta keep the heat
Sixty on the bezel, a hundred on the rings
Sitting pretty baby with a cash money bling
12 am I'm on the way to club
After three bottles I'll be ready to fuck
Some niggas even put me on their grocery lists
Right next to the whip cream and box of chocolates
Designer pussy, my shit come in flavors
High-class taste niggas got to spend paper
Lick me right the first time or you gotta do it over
Like it's rehearsal for a tootsie commercial
How many licks does it take
Till you get to the center of the?
How many licks does it take
Till you get to the center of the? Tell me
How many licks does it take
Till you get to the center of the? Oh, oh
How many licks does it take
Till you get to the center of the? Oh, oh, oh
How many licks does it take
Till you get to the center of the? Tell me
How many licks does it take
Till you get to the center of the? Let me know, let me know
How many licks does it take
Till you get to the center of the? Oh, oh
How many licks does it take
Till you get to the center of the? Oh, oh
How many licks does it take
Till you get to the center of the? Yeah
How many licks does it take
Till you get to the center of the?
How many licks does it take
Till you get to the center of the? Oh, oh
How many licks does it take
Till you get to the center of the? Tell me
How many licks does it take
Till you get to the center of the? Oh, oh
How many licks does it take
Till you get to the center of the? Oh, oh, oh
How many licks does it take
Till you get to the center of the?
