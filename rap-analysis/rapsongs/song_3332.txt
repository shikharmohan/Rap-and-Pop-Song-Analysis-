It's goin' down, yo the girl got a gun, best run
Because she's quick to flip and empty out the clip
And make a man understand where she's comin' from
The hardcore's connected to the base of her fate
She just breaks and bring drama to the situation
Ejaculation of my projectile, she's buck wild
Better recognize when she comes she comes correct
Collects respect and if not, you catch a broken neck
Buddy look down and your shirts all bloody, looks like
She caught you with a bad one for messin' with da mad one
Told you 'bout this girl before, you didn't listen to me, as I talk now
You're stalked by the hunter of the fronter who's size five and sexy
Quick, they catch your body and another one next week
Huh, it doesn't matter 'cuz the girl stays strapped
She says she had enough of men and now she's lookin' for payback
And there's no way you can fade her, son
She walks softly but she carries a big gun
She walks softly but she carries a big gun
She walks softly but she carries a big gun
She walks softly but she carries a big gun
And there's no way that you can fade her, son
She walks softly but she carries a big gun
She walks softly but she carries a big gun
She walks softly but she carries a big gun
She walks softly but she carries a big gun
The most venomous feminist homie, she ain't soft
You give her trouble then she might cut your head off
Or something that you like to think's the best
She'll blow big holes in your chest
She says she gotta 'cuz she says a lotta ladies won't
She says she gotta 'cuz she says a lotta ladies don't
She says she gotta 'cuz she says a lotta ladies can't
She says she gotta 'cuz she knows a lotta ladies
Romance the thoughts of giving men their own medicine
Electrocute 'em, light 'em up like Con Edison
She got no fear five rings in their ear, holes in their nose
Way-out clothes, living life to the fullest buck shot and bullets
Triggers she'll pull it, Earth she wanna rule it, maybe she will
'Cuz she's quick to kill, the city lights make her dresses tight
Yes she bites, you never know where she'll come from
She walks softly but she carries a big gun
She walks softly but she carries a big gun
She walks softly but she carries a big gun
She walks softly but she carries a big gun
And there's no way that you can fade her, son
She walks softly but she carries a big gun
She walks softly but she carries a big gun
She walks softly but she carries a big gun
She walks softly but she carries a big gun
You got no time to trip or argue, you're through, I'll bet she gets ya
Homeboy you'll catch a stretcher like so many before, she's on a
Body count tour but not rock she's puttin' sucker punks in cops
You say she's nothin' but a woman then you come up shot
You say, "Why you wanna kill me?" and she says "Why not?"
Pop, she got a body that'll make you cry
Pop, she got a shawty that'll make you die
Don't bring drama to her homie 'cuz you'll wind up flat
She'll put your ass horizontal then she'll peel your cap
She got no lovin', love is something that she never had
She loved her mother but she hate her motherfucking dad
So stay the hell out her way 'cuz the girl don't play none
She walks softly but she carries a big gun
She walks softly but she carries a big gun
She walks softly but she carries a big gun
So don't even try to play her, son.
She walks softly but she carries a big gun
She walks softly but she carries a big gun
She walks softly but she carries a big gun
So don't even try to front, son
She walks softly but she carries a big gun
She walks softly but she carries a big gun
She walks softly but she carries a big gun
