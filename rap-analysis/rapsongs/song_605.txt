BoneÃ¢Â¦
[Flesh]
And hear that raw shit
We blow this mother fuckers
And never obeyed the law bitch
Ever get noticed all you other niggas are frogs
Got skeletons in your closet
Wanna be blowed away wita gauge
I be rottin till pieces they shattered
Niggas they scattered they testin like bullets
They gather up how many mudered
Don't matter up in this rap shit
You got to come with it cant fake the funk at all
And bet your ganna fall studying the bone thug style
But whatcha ganna do when you face to face with the 5th dawg
Sneakin federals get wet I'ma predator the reap
No mercy those sleep where my niggas creep
And remember they crept and they came with Eazy
Cant calm me down give me a pound smoke and a bong
Just too damn greedy see these want to be these
G's just cuz of our thug mentality
It'll be casualties face that gorilla with a nigga torked at chu
Niggas who slippin I'm commin to get you die they flat on their backs collapsed perhaps
You shoulda knew when you came threw
You fucked with a nigga too deadly
Haters all try to come fuck with the gust
Well wanna test these nutz G you aint ready
But do what chu got to do I'll rob you fools
I'll cruse till grim reaps through
Nigga motherfuck em don't trust em
I'll buck em in the gut and shoot you too
[Chorus]
Now you cant hate us all day
We aint leavin no way
We changed the whole game
We brought you into the future
From the 99
Come on come on come on come on come on
Now you cant hate us all day
We aint leavin no way
We changed the whole game
We brought you into the future
From the 99
Come on come on come on come on come on
[Layzie]
Well it's the niggas the niggas the killas that's raised round sin
Niggas they try to conetend but know they cant win
When I'm breakin flesh up outa the pen
Gimme the hin and gimme the gin
Ready to put in my work again
Nigga better watch it you got it
I'm poppin quick for the dividends
I'm in it to win it
The rest of these rappers that shit is on pause
Got too many flaws you niggas is soft
Thry lyrics is false the reason I'm commin to break em off
Got to get mine so I'm takin yours
Wishin they never did open the door
I'm kickin it through bitch get on the floor
Knowin they never ganna talk no more hoes
Original niggas that's right we always been down for the murda man
I'ma come back to serve the game break em on down and hurt em man
I never give no mercy mercy after thirty five million still thirsty thirsty
[Chorus]
[Krayzie]
Now yall know niggas been here since we was runnin around with Eazy-E
They was like who was these little niggas talking all of this shit from the Cleveland streets
They aint nothing like these
And we never had beef cuz we was a different kind of breed
Beef with a nigga you bleed fuckin with bone
Been blowin some weed and singing my song hoe
My nigga that's krayzie layzie wish flesh
Wanna bet we the all time best
The force of the rhythm we give em similar to a sawed off pump hittin your chest
Rippin your vest listen to that
You know when we commin for trouble cuz we got em barrels runnin up on you
aint none of you ready for murder ta bubble I'm I pump and (??) defeated them
all
They was all scheming thinking wed fall
Then all of a sudden we got up and balled again
Now you cant witness the hearts of men
The game was down
To help it survive we blew through like fresh oxygen
And I got my nine millimeter cocked again
You thug niggas is not my friend
[Chorus]
[Wish]
When we crept wasn't nothing like this
Had to be different so we came with a twist
Straight from the streets where the niggas get rich
Better find a pattern till you see who it is
Livin is hard make soldier growin see what it is take order
Who knew thugs true we bring it through for two one six
We in this put it down make you feel this
We don't fuck around thugs get down nigga ask around
From the center we flip thugstas equiped
Prepared to make any niggas wig split
Lawyers on our payroll So I never stay long
Back out lay low no aint go so I stay gone
Thuggin it down to the law they at me
Lookin at a thug keeping it raw I got you
Fuckin with me wrong well look what happened
Thugstas got it thugstas got it
We on the same thang make change make change
Repay if you got to do your thing better him than me ok
Its like that around my way
Better hit than dead they say
You don't want to see that grey
So watch your back while you on that grind
Move forward no rewind watch niggas all the time
Cuz they want your spot they want your spot
Nigga fuck that
[Chorus]
