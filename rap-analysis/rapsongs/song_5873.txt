Well here's a shout out to all those who think that we slipped
Doin' this ever since 165, north 15th breakdancin' with slick
Nigga what, I'll beat your butt, you niggas on a beef or what
And if I gotta go deep, I'll cut and if you try to face this
The naughty by the nature gonna lace this
Track, we be the cream of the pack
Don't come up in my face with bullshit 'cuz you're bound to get slapped
And then we'll take it to a level where you're gonna get clapped
And then we'll all be up in court, I don't got time for that
'Cuz I'm, one third, naughty, look into my eyes, yeah you know me
Ain't nobody pimpin' like us three, call us masters, O.P.P
And when I draw the line don't get in the way, I'm paper chasin'
Or I'll be cuttin' you off like Friday, the 13th and I'm Jason
Single don't mingle with ladies hearts, I'm a thief
I'm not a virgin but virgo, birthday September 17th
And don't ask me for favors 'cuz it'll be just like pullin' teeth
I'm on some new shit with niggas 'cuz you continually sleep, don't creep
