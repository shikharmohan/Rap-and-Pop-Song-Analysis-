Being caught up in the fame
A part of the glamour and glitz
Platinum rings and different things
How easy we forget
For it is him, the Lord Almighty
Who allows us our success
When you on top above the charts
How easy we forget
Do you think without him
You would be who you are?
For if he made Heaven and earth
He also made you a star
So as we reach the year two thousand
You know there's one higher than us
And I come to be that tool to tell you
In God we must trust
Love you
