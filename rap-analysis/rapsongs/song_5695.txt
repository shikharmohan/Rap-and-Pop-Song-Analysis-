They say the goodness in life
Belongs to those who believe
So, I believe, yes
I start to think, and then I sink
Into the paper, like I was ink
When I'm writing I'm trapped in between the line
I escape when I finish the rhyme
(Aiyyo)
I start to think, and then I sink
Into the paper, like I was ink
When I'm writing I'm trapped in between the line
I escape when I finish the rhyme

My pops said he was in love when he made me
Thought about it for a second, wasn't hard to see
I could hear he was sincere, was a game of promotion
The entire affair's probably charged wit emotion
But love call your heart, I guess you got to pursue
12-11-73 my life is testament
Praise the beneficent, element that rest
Devoid in the form that make love manifest
I spent my early years in Roosevelt Project
It was a bright valley wit some dark prospects
In '83, Venny C was the host wit the most
I listened to the Rap Attack and held the radio close
I listened to the Rap Attack and held the radio close
This is far before the days of high glamor and pose
Aiyyo power from the street light made the place dark
I know a few understand what I'm talkin' about
It was love for the thing that made me wanna stay out
It was love for the thing that made me stay in the house
Spendin' time, writin' rhymes
Tryin' to find words that describe the vibe, that's inside the space
When you close yo' eyes and screw yo' face
Is this the pain of too much tenderness
To make me nod my head in reverence
Should I visit this place and remember it?
To build landmarks here as evidence
Night time, spirit shook my temperament
To write rhymes that portray this sentiment
We live the now for the promise of the infinite
We live the now for the promise of the infinite
And we believe in the promise
(Love, love, love)
Yes yes, y'all and we don't stop because
I start to think, and then I sink
Into the paper, like I was ink
When I'm writing I'm trapped in between the line
I escape when I finish the rhyme
(Aiyyo)

My folks said they was in love when they had me
I take they love they made me wit to make rhymes and beats
(Can you feel?)
The raw deal, it's all wheel-driven
Contemplate the essence of beats, rhymes and living
Speech in line wit the rhythm, designed wit the rhythm
Ears and eyes keepin' good time wit the rhythm
I shine wit the rhythm, the Black Star Gallactica
Big number fleetin', we ancient like the Abbacca's
After us, I see most proceed to be trees
Sproutin' leaves, given breeze to the we who believe
I MC, which means I must cultivate the earth
Back straight backs, hard beats and hard work
I be the funky drummer to soften the hard earth
(Amen)
Pray Allah keep my soul and heart clean
(Amen)
Pray the same thing again for all my team
This go out to Fort Greene and on out to Queens
Uptown to Boogie Down, yo just look around
And shook up the world, like Ali in 6-3
(Right)
I'm reachin' the height that you said cannot be
I'm bringin' the light but you said we can't see
Saw the new day commin', and it look just like me
Some burst through the clouds, my photo ID
I bring light to your day and raise yo' degree
The Universal Magnetic, you must respect it
From end to beginning, [unverified] true and livin'
Every changing, it was a state of magnificent
Building it now for the promise of the infinite
Building it now for the promise of the infinite because
I start to think, and then I sink
Into the paper, like I was ink
When I'm writing I'm trapped in between the line
I escape when I finish the rhyme
(Aiyyo)
