Dear God, as I begin this day, my thought turn to you, and I ask for your help and guidance in everything I say and do, give me the patience that I need to keep my peace of mind, and with life's cares, I hope dear God, some happiness to find, let me live but for today, not worrying what's ahead, for I have trust that you will see I get my daily bread, give me the courage to face life's trials and not from troubles run, and let me keep this thought in mind "Thy will, not mine, be done." And if some wish I do not get though I have prayed to thee, please help me to believe and understand you know what's best for me.  I've failed you many times, I know, but tonight when I rest, I hope that I can say, "Dear God, I've tried my best."
