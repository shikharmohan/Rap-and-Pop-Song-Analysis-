[singing]
I donÃÂ¢€t mean to bother you but I was wondering
you make the temperature start to rise
everytime you step into the room, omg
[Dr Dre]
I must be something like an X pill
b-tches start touching themself and singing
(Everything about you turns me on)
Everything about you turns me on
Wanna f-ck you so bad right now
it coulda been the clothes or coulda been the rolling stone
or coulda been the scent of a hundred million
b-tches smell when thereÃÂ¢€s money in the air
money in the
money in the air air air
[Dr Dre]
7 stars must be my aura
a master levitation, I stay up in the clouds
penthouse hovering a hundred floors up
IÃÂ¢€m on some (?)
the ladies love the way I shine
IÃÂ¢€m like (?) when IÃÂ¢€m erotic
I make you squirm no hands on your body
under my control anytime
anytime I wanna make you hit the dancefloor
you already know whats my name
so I aint gotta spell it no more
I did it to the fullest I aint gotta sell it no more
tonight IÃÂ¢€m looking for my biggest fans
she in the crowd singing my jam
Everything about you turns me on
Everything about you
Everything about you turns me on
I wanna f-ck you
I wanna f-ck you
I wanna f-ck you so bad right now
