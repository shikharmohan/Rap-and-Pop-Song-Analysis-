And away we go, with a crazy flow, oh
All the ladies know and they babies know, we pro
Deep in your mind, while I'm repeatin' this rhyme, we glow
I'm teachin' this time, that off beat I speak of a rhyme, flow
They just too slow, if you keepin' in time, let's go
That b-boy thang, how long you think we gonna hang? I don't know
My style is complex, I got next, indeed we close the show
Still kickin' the truth to the young black youth, we gotta grow
My message is broader, hip-hop's the true world order, see it
Every son, every daughter, if you think you oughta hip-hop, be it
You can sit on the sideline or your mind you can free it
I can rock for a long time with more rhymes 'cause hip hop, we it
Who's it, we don't use it, or do it as music when we spit
That murder, that crime, never furthered your mind but you repeat it
Whatever rhyme goes against your inner purpose you must delete it
As you can see it, I'm the average MC and hip-hop we teach it
All over the world, this goes out to all b-boys and girls, worldwide
