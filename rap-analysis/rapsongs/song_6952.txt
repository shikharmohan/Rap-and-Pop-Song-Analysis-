We be blazin'
So amazin'
Everybody get down
Everybody get down
We be blazin'
So amazin'
Everybody get down
Everybody get down
New year, new record, time to do bigger shit
Caught a plane to Cali linked with my nigga Quik
I figure with the combination we bomb the nation
But stay calm and patient
As the world get hyped from hearin' our musical conversation
This a beautiful situation right here
Given birth on the track 'cuz the cypher stay pregnant with ideas
And we rockin' it, rock, rock, rockin' it
Tell the hater players put a sock in it
Proper shit, that you got to get, 'cuz we properly document
How cats look more like dicks than the Washington monument
Phallicaly tryin' to challenge me, but who you racin' wit'
It's amazin' the lyrical lingerie I be lacin' shit, we be blazin' it
Put it in the air with the chronic
My lyrics like drugs got you hooked on my phonics
From Brooklyn to Compton the lounge of Soundbombing
Still rockin' over "Balance and Options," now
If you got a spliff then put it in the air
If you want a rift then put it in the air
If you shakin' yo' ass, put it in the air
If you makin' it last, put it in the air
If you leave the crib strapped then put it in the air
Take ya hand of your gat and put it in the air
Snook your bud in the club, put it in the air
Got nuttin' but love, put it in the air
They say my rhymes is too heavy, I come thicker than the fog
You get it when I retire and battle my catalogue
Writin' rhymes in my Captain's log, BlackStar date
MC's fake like Egyptian Gods in Stargate
Lovin' the hate, bubble all types of weight in they rap
I draw blood like mosquitoes y'all annoy like gnats
Pop that around the wrong cat get laid flat
Concrete adjust to the contours in your back
Quik where you at?
Yo I'm in the back room makin' a run
Ain't even touched her 'n makin' her cum
Now you can catch me out in' Portland wit Stoudamire
Everybody doin' shows but I'm the hottest flier
Bitches say honest, I swear to God
So how come then believin' them is so damn hard
Could you really blame a nigga if I fucked a skate
You didn't even pay that's why you flunked the date
All you did was eat salad, talk shit about niggas and drink wine
And your answer kept changin' 'cuz bitch you keep lyin'
Talkin' 'bout 'he make me sick
All he do is disrespect me keep callin' me bitch
And he only wanna fuck me when he all full of dope
What the fuck you think I'm here for not to love you I hope
All I'm 'bout to do is listen for a minute
While I get my drink in n' introduce you to my dog Kweli 'n go up in it
If you got a spliff then put it in the air
If you want a rift then put it in the air
If you shakin' yo' ass, put it in the air
If you makin' it last, put it in the air
If you leave the crib strapped then put it in the air
Take ya hand of your gat and put it in the air
Snook your bud in the club, put it in the air
Got nuttin' but love, put it in the air
C'mon
We be blazin'
So amazin'
Everybody get down
Everybody get down
We be blazin'
So amazin'
Everybody get down
Everybody get down
Now let me tell you how I am
I'm mild-mannered at day but superhero at night
I got the special invite to make your spot look right
No ice, no rain, not bottles of champagne 'n
Half these motherfuckers can't pronounce my name
I'm so cool while you hyper in' the coffee shop
Hype niggas make girls be like 'get off me stop'
Real niggas like thirst so of course we rock
'Cuz the game unauthordox, off top
You got cold feet like I pulled off your socks
Always goin' down town pullin' all the stops
Your breath smellin' like fish from straight off the docks
Dats how you lost your spot, you too hype
If you got a spliff then put it in the air
If you want a rift then put it in the air
If you shakin' yo' ass, put it in the air
If you makin' it last, put it in the air
If you leave the crib strapped then put it in the air
Take ya hand of your gat and put it in the air
Snook your bud in the club, put it in the air
Got nuttin' but love, put it in the air
Yea, we be blazin'
So amazin'
Everybody get down
Everybody get down
