To all my people goin' through it on a daily basis
And it seem like the world is full of cold places
Keep your head up, fuck what they said
'Cause you can do it and the man will get you through it
I believe that, homie, I believe that
If I can picture that, I bring a picture back
They say gangsta, gangsta, tell me how you do it
How you get through it and them other niggas blew it
I keep my eye on the prize then pursue it
Chase it like a cheetah, choke it out and subdue it
So self educate, nigga don't hate
'Cause the game I got is [Incomprehensible]
Fuck with Cube, I'm better than Youtube
Fuck with them dudes, them nigga's is new school
The game don't change, just the playa's
The rhymes don't change, just the fuckin' rhyme sayers
They make it up as they go along
But I'm goin' on twenty five years strong
This shit I say might get you through the day
Or change your whole life in a major way
The shit they say might catch you a case
The shit I say feel like your birthday
To all my people goin' through it on a daily basis
And it seem like the world is full of cold places
Keep your head up, fuck what they said
'Cause you can do it and the man will get you through it
I believe that, homie, I believe that
If I can picture that, I bring a picture back
You know what mama said it be days like this
Straight hell on earth for come about the abyss
She said don't let them see you crawl
Don't let them see you fall, all they want
To do is laugh when you tear your draws
It's a cold world, nigga, bring bomber jacket
If there's another hustle out there, I'ma crack it
Fuck the new dance, I'ma learn how to eat
Get my mind right, stay up out these fuckin' streets
They keep callin' me, they keep callin'
All the lil' homies keep fallin'
In 'em sand traps, nigga's can't figure out
In the fast lane, boy put the bridges out
Make my blood boil, get ya life spoil
Get you in the system, get you in the soil
And you funeral sponsored by Unical
Saw your UVN nigga digital
To all my people goin' through it on a daily basis
And it seem like the world is full of cold places
Keep your head up, fuck what they said
'Cause you can do it and the man will get you through it
I believe that, homie I believe that
If I can picture that, I bring a picture back
I know it's fucked up how they do us
Pretend they really care but then they Jerry Lewis
Take that money that was allocated to us
Put us in some fucked up trailers then sue us
Watchin' Katrina is worser than Argentina
See New Orleans gettin' bitch slapped by FEMA
Louisiana got racist ass politics
Free the genesigs, nigga free the genesigs
Your honor, Osama, Obama
Even your mama ain't fuckin' with my karmas
They want us to quit, forget
And not give a shit about these sick ass politics
A lunatic is in the White House
Make me wanna go do a lick right now
But they'll make a nigga bow down
In the penitentiary a billion dollar industry
To all my people goin' through it on a daily basis
And it seem like the world is full of cold places
Keep your head up, fuck what they said
'Cause you can do it and the man will get you through it
I believe that, homie, I believe that
If I can picture that, I bring a picture back
I believe that, homie I believe that
If I can picture that, I bring a picture back
