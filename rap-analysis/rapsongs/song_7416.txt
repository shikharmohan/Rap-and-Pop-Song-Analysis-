So yo, no, all I want you to do is just tell them cats
On the real, keep your game high man, keep it up
Word up, never stop your goals, man
Ya know what I'm sayin'? Yo son, on the real
I'ma get a sneaker, just like y'all
I need help, I need help, the Government is after me
I need help, someone help me please, someone help me
They already did 2Pac in, Biggie Smalls
Someone help me, someone help me please
Ahh! I'm a groupie for life, about nine wife
All the babies are mine, save a child life
No more doctors deliverin' my babies
Stickin' pins, killin' me slowly
To the President, you say, I'm a welfare fraud
You motherfuckin' right, let's burn this dark house white
Insecure about my ding-dong, married to Babylon
My queen lookin' at me like a pawn
Splash the worst, rehearse a verse, flashdance on the universe
Televise the work, Network Shop, say, your neck hurt
What up Dirt, nine diagram phoenix on your sweatshirt
Thirty thousand went bezerk, it's like clockwork
Rockport, Mr. Raw God, hold the fort
Collect thoughts, select sports, sideswipe by the white horse
French cut, gleamin' in the Benz truck, what up tellin' my mens what?
Ten times platinum and we ends up
Draped out, jumpin' out a cake, now throw your tape out
Furniture style, holdin' the mic, we got it laid out
Fine iodine, Einstein remind mine
People swam nine, didn't know they own kind, wrong time
Denim rap, competition quick, handle that
Suckin' the Jim Hat, pervertin' on my raps'll get you slidapped
Mix drink Cuban Link lizink, flip A to zinc
Plus, expensive like a Roman mink, now think
An ugly thirty-six chamber degree, what you wanna rhyme?
Deep bring 600 ABC, through the love white hate line
I'm telling you tornado, 42 billion thought travel the year 90's
Parallel controls to the wakes, I dig woman's stomach swell
My borough's dark, many lights, UFO kites
Benjamin Franklin got it right
Abraham, I stuck your cherry tree
Your white head came out my black pussy
I ran Rip Van Winkle on all fours
Mountains, twinkle twinkle star, Tarzan in a jar
And then came out, Jane Flintstone in my gravel pit
Kill the chatterin', niggaz bust shots keep 'em scatterin'
Blood splatterin' on point like a javelin, fuck battlin'
You cats is only good for babblin'
Imagining yourself as the God space travellin'
'Round the seven rings of Saturn and
Got my sword plus the Abbot in the chamber
Nine in the clip at the gatherin',
We left you staggerin', yo, it had to been
Hot Nickel who broke bread at the Vatican
Stick a pin in a citizen mental food, got us diggin' in
My compliments to the chef
ME TH like amphatimens
Yes, stick it to the veteran
Blaow blaow! Blown to death, take your medicines
I put the stick in your mu-sick with Osirus
Bound to blow like a bad sinus
Stay up at night, don't sleep on your morn
Rest in the day 'cause it's sunlight
Reverse thought psychology
Child wild adventures walk trillions of square inches
Ten percentage try to drain me of my mental strengthage
Heavy wattage knowledge cleans blood clottage and
Retardage, I refine the garbage logic, exterminate your cottage
Thirty-six anger, dirty language is the stranger
The mangler, the honor roll singer, righteous finger
When we shine a, we always find a never minor major
Hard to spot we dangerous with our behavior
Australian Venezuelaen illegal aliens
Chameleons, all catch the feelin' we're revealin'
Killer bee, keep your mind at ease, lay back like Adam fuckin' Eve
Four thousand years in the garden, puffin' trees
I aim slang, I maintain through the main vein
The answer came clever, when we do greatness
Through trial and error mile of terror motormouth
Let the odor out, fumin' greater, the temper in my spine huminator
The super grass, childish blast, sleepy eye stash
The hashish masterpiece, Osirus is the virus
This split second splash, severe drop is near pop
There's fallin' teardrops, now is it worth your career?
