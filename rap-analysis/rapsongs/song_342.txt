Let's get busy, Daddy Kane
You know, BW, I've heard it's said
That a woman is a man's greatest gift
Sure, you're right
And the success ain't nothin'
Unless you have someone to share it with
Hmm, so true, so true
I've always felt like it's great to achieve in life
Without having someone other than yourself
To share what it is
Sure you're right, quite sane
In my case I may have found someone
I want all of that someone
Yeah, I know what you mean
Well, I tell you, my friend, just communicate with her
And always say what you mean, mean what you say
Because it's her that you are all about
Come here, baby, come bring all of you to me
When I say I want all of you
I mean I want all of you
From your head to your feet
I wanna taste everything
From your lipstick to your toe nail polish
Communicate, brother
I want you, I want to
I wanna hold you, I wanna massage you
I wanna comfort you, I wanna soothe you
You know the way you're standing still there
I wanna just lay on the floor
And make love your shadow
Sounds silly, don't it? Not really
But for real, let me come on over there
Run my fingers through your hair
Hold you near and undo that brassiere, my dear
Because tonight, girl, all of me wants all of you
Baby, all of me wants all of you
Let's start tonight, I know you're right
Over and over and over
Let's do it now and show me how
Over and over and over again
You know I can tell you're serious, aren't you?
And I'm glad to see that you're feeling this way
That there's somebody in this world who can
Make you wanna give up that kind of commitment
Love is such a beautiful thing when it's equally shared
Tell 'em, maestro
When two people find the same common ground
They call it havin' so much in common
Makin' love is one of those things
That people these days seem to find in common
Communicate, BW, sure you're right
So I want you to know that I really feel
That you're gonna make it all the way
With this young lady
You got my love, my respect
[Incomprehensible] young man [Incomprehensible]
Baby, all of me wants all of you
Let's start tonight, I know you're right
Over and over and over
Let's do it now and show me how
Over and over and over again
Baby, all of me wants all of you
Let's start tonight, sure you're right
Over and over and over
I want it now and show me how
Over and over and over again
Baby, all of me wants all of you
Let's start tonight, I know you're right
Over and over and over
Let's do it now
