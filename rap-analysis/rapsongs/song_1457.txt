Ohh, there go that bullshit again
You heard that shit? Nah, I ain't hear that
That's that bullshit from the other day
They done took the buffalo girls beat and changed it all around
They playin' themselves
You remind me when I reminisce of you
Of all the freaky things I wanna do to you
Rub me up, rub me down, rub me all around
Kiss me here, kiss me there, kiss me everywhere
Tell me what's the cost to get in line 'cause you are mine tonight
Gonna give you all I got to give, if only for one night
I will love you right, I don't care if you diss me
I will do you right, I don't care if you don't want me
Baby baby won't you be my baby baby
Be my baby baby baby baby?
Baby baby, won't you be my baby baby
Be my baby baby baby baby?
Now I forgot how to forget so I remember your face
With your pretty accent, wearin' man-attract scent
Others fakin' constantly stakin' out pockets of dreams
Always tryin' to sham too that's why they crave champagne
But the blame still remains not to be on you
I know your style and your love lasts long like the island I'm from
I'm on the drum man, and it's all good
'Cause I flexed on your ex, make sure he understood
That you would, never again want to be his wife
So we connect lips to hips, and uhh, eyes to thighs
You're my sophisticated, lady
All mine, if you wasn't I'd go crazy
Baby baby, won't you be my baby baby
Be my baby baby baby baby?
Baby baby, won't you be my baby baby
Be my baby baby baby baby?
Baby baby, won't you be my baby baby
Be my baby baby baby baby?
