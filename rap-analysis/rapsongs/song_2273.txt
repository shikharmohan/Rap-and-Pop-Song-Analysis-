He was once a thug from around the way, Eazy
But you should, bitch, shut the fuck up
Get the fuck outta here, yo, Trey
Wassup? Gimme a funky ass bassline
What the fuck is up in the place to be?
Comin' on the mic is Eazy muthafuckin' E
Trey is on the beat, Yellow's on the cut
So listen up close, while we rip shit up
Well, I'm Eazy-E, I got bitches galore
You may have a lot of bitches but I got much more
Wit my super duper group comin' out to shoot
Eazy-E, muthafukas, cold knockin' the boots
'Cause I'm a hip hop thugster, I used to be a mugster
If you heard Compton, you think I own a drugstore
Gettin' stupid because I know how
An' if a sucker talks shit, I give him a
8 ball sippin', the bitches are flippin'
Slow down, I hit a dippin', continue my trippin'
Hittin' my switches, collect from my bitches
The money that I make so I can add to my riches
Fill my stash box an' start rubbin' my gat
Feelin' good as hell because my pockets are fat
A hardcore villian, cold roamin' the streets
An' wit a homie like Dre just supplyin' the beats
Because I'm a gansta havin' fun
Never leave the pad without packin' a gun
Hittin' hard as fuck, I make you ask what was it
Boy you should have known by now, Eazy duz it
I was knockin' muthafukas out
What's your name boy? Funky, fresh Eazy-E
Kick, kick that shit
Where you from fool? Compton, yea
Rollin' through the hood, cold tearin' shit up
Stick my head out the window an' I say, "What's up?"
To the niggaz on the corner cold bumpin' the box
But you know that's an alibi for slangin' the rocks
A dice game started so I said, "What the fuck?"
So I put my shit in park an' had to try my luck
Hard to roll wit my bitch jockin' 24 7
Rolled them muthafukas, ate 'em up, hit 11
Got another point, I made a ten a fo'
Was takin' niggaz money an' was itchin' for mo'
Laughin' in their faces an' said you're all makin' me rich
Then one punk got jealous, cold slapped my bitch
He pulled out his gat, I knew he wouldn't last
So I said to myself, "Homeboy, you better think fast"
He shot, then I shot
As you can see, I cold broke his ass
Because I'm a gansta havin' fun
Never leave the pad without packin' a gun
Hittin' hard as fuck, I make you ask what was it
Boy you should have known by now, Eazy duz it
Wait a minute, wait a minute, who does it?
Muthafuckin' Eazy duz it, but how does he do it?
Eazy duz it do it eazy, that's what I'm doin'
Stop, man, whatcha gonna do now?
Now I'm a break it down just to tell a little story
Straight out the box, from the gangsta category
About a sucker, a sucker muthafucka
He's addicted, he's a smoker but in Compton called a clucker
He used to have a house car an' golden rings
But the cooky, cooky crack took all those things
He must of been starvin' 'cause he broke in my house
Caught the nigga on the street an' straight took his ass out
Now I wanted for a murder that I had to commit
Yea, I went to jail, but that wasn't shit
Got to the station about a quarter of nine
Called my bitch to get me out 'cause I was down for mine
The bitch was a trip cold hung up the phone
Now my only phone call was in the gankin' zone
All the things I did for her like keepin' her rich
I swear when I get out, I'm gonna kill the bitch
Well by now you should know it was just my luck
The bailiff of the station was a neighborhood cluck
I looked him straight in the eye an' said, "What's up?"
An' said let's make a deal, you know I'll do you up
Now back on the streets an' my records are clean
I creeped on my bitch wit my Uzi machine
Went to the house an' kicked down the door
Unloaded like hell, cold smoked the ho
Because I'm a gansta havin' fun
Never leave the pad without packin' a gun
Hittin' hard as fuck, I make you ask what was it
Boy you should have known by now, Eazy duz it
From around the way, born in '73
Hardcore B boy named Eazy-E
It's '88 now, '73's obsolete
A nigga wit a serious ass attitude an' 100% street
An' if you all wanna hear some more
In one way or the other, I'm a bad brother
Word to the muthafuka
