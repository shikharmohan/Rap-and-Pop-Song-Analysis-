Make me hot, Pete, hold me down, Pete
Make me hot, Pete, hold me down, Pete
We was in the club, that's where I saw you
It was my nigga, Pete, he was a tall dude
Wanted to get your number, so I could call you
Comin' to Missy Aunts, oh Pete, don't fall, dude
Just make me hot, Pete, hold me down, Pete
Make me hot, Pete, hold me down, Pete
Pete, my singer, don't know how to sing
(Just make me hot)
Pete, I don't got no hook
(Just make me hot)
Pete, I don't know how to write sixteen bars
  (Just make me hot)
Pete, oh just make me hot
  (Just make me hot, just make me hot)
Just make me hot, Pete, hold me down, Pete
Make me hot, Pete, hold me down, Pete
