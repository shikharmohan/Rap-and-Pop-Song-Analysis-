We're gonna do it like this

So right about this time
You should throw your hands up in the air
How many people got Nike's on?
If you got your Nike's on, put your feet up in the air
If you don't got Nike's on
I think you need to keep your feet down
'Cause the party is live
(Nervous)
And we're in total stereo, ya kno what I'm sayin'?
So all the suckers out there that wanna test

I'd like to give a shout out to who?
Big Daddy Kane, Heavy D and Eric B
Melody, D-Square

So just throw your hands in the air
Just throw your hands in the air
KRS-One is here without a care
And I don't have no fears homeboy
So all the suckers out there that wanna test BDP

We look around for the best possible break
And once we find it, we just break
Or we just break

There's two ways to do this, you see what I'm sayin'?
If you feel the board, you feel around
We got tracks one to track 48
We find track seven and break it down

All up in Soundview, in Brooklyn
Then when the cops come for you, ha, ha, ha
