Hustlin,looks like me livin got me illin sinnin like everyday/
im spendin my time preventin my mind flippin and goin insane/
and now that we comin up on these last days well into the fast lane/
its only contributin to my bad ways/
this aint even my life 'cause i was supposed to be livin forever right here in the flesh/
and not up in heaven 'cause i know god gona make it better/
we runnin around chasin this paper like thats gon save us/
we so caught up in tryin to get famous its a shame but, can you blame us?/
'cause takin in all these hardtimes keep on blindin our mind/
why we dont wana be like god shoot for stars in the sky/
niggaz determined to get rich im afraid gon' loose they blessins/
so the question is, you wana stay alive or try be wealthy for now/
[Bizzy]
What are you talkin about, look at these mothaerfuckers in the streets walkin around/
assed out, dead-an-widowed, another abandoned house/
they dont know nothin bout random house/
see em all pitiful wit hands out baby girl was rammed out, harmony-harmony, stand out/
sound of bone take em to beverly hills and round off/
ante up rubberband quicker than you can get an ounce off/
uhh,back to the real world were the murderin happens/
its touchin everybody, includin the news and the rappin/
why would i battle but put it nobody blastin/
everybody would only be spittin metaphors put it on jesse jackson/
and you can just ask him the rappin is real/
and you cant turn me down like that im still your child, pac too i got as much pac in me as you got in you/
give em the game, break it down, yall better read the bible dog/
yall better know who wrote the scriptures, yall better protect your soul/
now the bone is finally focused, pay attention to real talkin/
7 sign mo thug, thug line still shinin on em/
