Aww, shit
Check it out, yo, 1992 begins the new wave for the blunt rollers
You know what I'm sayin'?
The saga of the Philly Blunt continues
The flava's the P Funk y'all get wit it, check it out
Check out a new type of gimmick which is splendid
Since you're down with other shit let's see if you're down with this
It's about strictly trying to roll a blunt
When you get the hang of it, you'll carry more blunts than Archie Bunk
First of all you get a fat bag of ism
From uptown, any local store sells the shit friend
Purchase a philly, not the city of Philly
Silly punk, I'm talking 'bout the shit called the Philly Blunt
Lick the blunt and then the Philly Blunt middle you split
Don't have a razor blade, use yo fuckin' fingertips
Crack the bag and then you pour the whole bag in
Spread the ism around until the ism reach each end
Take your finger and your thumb from tip to tip
Roll it in a motion then the top piece you lick
Seal it, dry it wit yo lighter if ya gotta
The results, hmm, proper
That's how you roll a blunt, that's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt, that's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt, that's how you roll a blunt
Let's all roll a blunt and get fucked up
That's how you roll a blunt, that's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt, that's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt, that's how you roll a blunt
Let's all roll a blunt and get fucked up, yeah
The second paragraph might makes you laugh
When a brotha rolls a blunt and his breath smells like grass
That's when you know you gotta take the blunt from him
'Cuz his breath has the dragon in the dungeon
Yo, yo, yo, light the blunt, uh yo, here's the lighter
I would if this shit would stop drippin' wit saliva
And if you gonna lick it, don't drown it with yo spit, shit
I dunno what dick or last puss you licked quick
And how 'bout the non-blunt rollin' females
That always fucks it up 'cuz they don't wanna break their Lee nails
Hee hee hee, sorry Red for spilling it
You better pickup every seed of it
Because I paid 10 bills for the get ill
And for spilling it you better get lost or get grilled
Bo know everything from sports to other stuff
But I bet you Bo dunno know to roll a blunt, haa haa
That's how you roll a blunt, that's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt, that's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt, that's how you roll a blunt
Let's all roll a blunt and get fucked up
That's how you roll a blunt, that's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt, that's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt, that's how you roll a blunt
  (Hey nigga pass the gotdamn blunt, shit)
Let's all roll a blunt and get fucked up
  (What you holding it all day for? Sit yo big ass down)
Yo, yo, check this out
I want all the real niggas out there and the females too
If you got a fat blunt in yo mouth and you feeling high as hell
I want y'all to repeat after me, check it out
I'm fucked up, I'm fucked up
I'm fucked up, I'm fucked up
I'm high as hell, I'm high as hell
I'm high as hell, I'm high as hell
  (Yea)
Last but not least, Redman would like to say peace
To all the blunt rollers from the Tri-State to the Middle East
And gimme a blunt when I kick the bucket
Devil or no Devil when I am the wrong one to be fucked with
So everybody put they blunt up in the air
Take a puff, blow the smoke out like ya just don't care
So, pump up the volume, so it's heard thru the next block
I'm out, peace to Red Foxx, I'm off to the cess spot
Yea, DJ Twinz in the house
Yea, Redman's in the house
Yo, peace to Pack Pistol Posse, the four, five, six
Yo, I'm out, yo Reg, turn this shit off man, turn that shit off
