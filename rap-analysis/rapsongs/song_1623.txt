First to bat steppin' up to the plate is
I'm the monsta' come on in closa', I'll roast ya'
Not never worried 'bout competition listen
I can twist men into pretzels
My jet skills can outrun 'cause it's fun I'm not done
One or even two could even try
It's not a even try I'll leave 'em why
Did you do it I'ma school kids and tease 'em and please 'em
For the treason that's the reason I'ma squeeze 'em
Make 'em tell and make 'em dwell they're not dead
I got lead, but I won't use it I'll refuse it
'Cause they're losin' I'll be merciful
I won't hurt the skull, with the hollow tip
I'll make sure they follow tips, that I tell 'em
I won't spell 'em, out they'll shout, in horror
'Cause they saw a metamorphis
I'ma force kids out the galaxy
So now ask me don't try to go around
Because I know the sound they're not stealthy
I'm dope, the opposer's,
I make sure you chose the straight and narrow
Prepare though, and be careful
You had your chance, you blew it
You had your chance,and you blew it
You had your chance, you blew it
You had your chance
Now peep this, they forgot and now they gonna rot
They didn't know that they could sell a lot
Of trash 'cause it doesn't smash or last
They got cash, but now how are you gonna survive
Because you strive to gamble
You're in shambles, and I'm glad
I could add flavor
I'm the savior, misbehavior can catch hell
None can match Del
Unless they stress, fresh
I'm nonetheless and take a guess
The one that make 'em go back and tell they crew
That Del is true, he tell a new way to say whatever's clever
I'm gonna sever
Necks of those who don't respect the rap legacy
Because I egg MC's, on the late night
They got away writin' clever raps
'Cause with that bullshit it sounds like they never rapped
In they life, I got a knife, that is lyrical
And Del is causin' fear and still has potential
They didn't learn, now the money's gonna burn
I yearn to make rap better, let's stick together
You had your chance, and you blew it
You had your chance, and you blew it
You had your chance, you blew it
You had your chance
You had your chance, you had your chance
You had your chance, uhh you blew it
