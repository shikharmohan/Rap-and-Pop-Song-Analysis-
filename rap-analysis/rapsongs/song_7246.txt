I made this song to let you know shit that I see ya
When you workin' dat ass, make a nigga think later on he gone
Be twerkin' that ass and I can tell by the way you throw it back
It ain't no hurting dat ass and ain't no room for nothing else but
That skirt but that ass, the jiggling shawty, got a nigga shivering shawty
And if you don't know what to do wit you better give it here shawty
Put a bend in her back, I'm throwing the dick she giving it back
I tell her if you ever give me dat ass I ain't giving it back
She bouncing her ass, later on I'm a blow a ounce wit her ass
Ride out wit her ass, cut sumethin' on the couch wit her ass
Then bounce to her pad, 'coz you know it ain't no housing her ass
'Coz since the first time I seen her, all I been thinking 'bout is her ass
A now a thug done chose
And I don't give a damn if the club done closed
Get the DJ a dub tell him spin one mo
So I can finish watching you poppin' yo
Shakin' yo, droppin' yo, bouncin' yo ass
Now all my guls say, do it baby, stick it baby
