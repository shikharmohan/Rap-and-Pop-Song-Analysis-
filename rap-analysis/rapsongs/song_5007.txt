A simplified(?) love sick taking no prisoners
Sunny day, cold heart- listen up listeners
Darkside love affair, out of time and in a rush
You can't help me till the sunrise lifts up(?)
Let's levitate up over the horizon
I can see it in your eyes, everything you're hiding
I can see the truth in you even when you're lying
Even through the darkness, I can see you shining
WELL ITS MIDNIGHT
AND ITS COLDER
PULL YOU CLOSER
I CAN SEE THROUGH
WHEN ITS SUNSHINE
AND ITS SOLAR
AND ITS OVER
GUESS ITS ME AND YOU
BLOOD. BY. SUN. LIGHT.
A played out love song playing in the background
Seems to describe every part of where we're at now
Every feeling that we ever had for each other
Every karaoke love letter, lyrics undiscovered
Now your mother used to tell me you ain't nothin but some trouble
Now it's a couple trouble makers making mayhem on the double
Tryna figure out the meaning and break apart the puzzles
Why they love you when I hate you when they hate the way I love you, solar(?)
WELL ITS MIDNIGHT
AND ITS COLDER
PULL YOU CLOSER
I CAN SEE THROUGH
WHEN ITS SUNSHINE
AND ITS SOLAR
AND ITS OVER
GUESS ITS ME AND YOU
BLOOD. BY. SUN. LIGHT.
A complicated heartbreak losing its direction
Cold day, warm heart- object of affection
My darkside love affair come to my protection
Midnight's on the way I'm losing my connection
Levitate up over the horizon
I can see it in your eyes, I know that you're hiding
I can see the truth in you even I know that you're lying
Throw away the darkness, I wanna see you shining
WELL ITS MIDNIGHT
AND ITS COLDER
PULL YOU CLOSER
I CAN SEE THROUGH
WHEN ITS SUNSHINE
AND ITS SOLAR
AND ITS OVER
ITS JUST ME AND YOU
