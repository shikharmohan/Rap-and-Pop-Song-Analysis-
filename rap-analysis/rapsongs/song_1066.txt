Yeah, yo, yo, yo yo, yo, yo
Yo, a touch of jazz y'all, yeah, yeah
[Unverified] y'all, yo they got us on the run, like
8 minutes to sunrise
Oh baby now, what are we gonna do?
(I don't know)
Pressure is mountin'
Oh baby now, how we gonna get through?
(I, don't, know)
Can't go left, can't go right
(Uh uh, uh uh)
Don't know, how we made it through the night
(C'mon c'mon c'mon)
7 minutes to sunrise
Oh baby now, what are we gonna do?
(Do it, do it)
It was once said by Black Thought that "Things fall apart"
Knew I shouldn't have been messin' with dude's girl from start
But I pimp from the heart, the art of it made it interestin'
Plus me and sister blend before we got intimate
Friend or no friend, my man caught wind
This chick is payin' me, it'll either cost me or cost him
Told her she shoulda lost him a while ago
(When?)
'Cause dude'll drink a pile of Mo' and defile her yo
I ain't here to start on this nigga, for me to wreck his broad
You could tell what I thought of this nigga
Nickname was Smoke, don't know if that was cause of cigarettes
(Or what?)
Or guns he tote, he called shots on the deck
So I wasn't tryin' to call his bluff, by his persona
You could see, he think he tough
If that wasn't enough, old girl had his son
This is Wild like the West I'm like Jesse on the run, uhh
6 minutes to sunrise
Oh baby now, what are we gonna do?
(I don't know)
Pressure is mountin
Oh baby now, how we gon' get through?

(Uh uh, uh uh)
Don't know, how we made it through the night
(Yo, we got)
5 minutes to sunrise
Oh baby now, what are we gonna do?
(Do it, do it)
I understand that time is runnin' out, I'm thinkin' of town-skippin'
Got a Chevy but the alternator be trippin'
I'm hittin' rum straight, thinkin' of a route to truncate
The streets is watchin', out is one way I put myself in his Nike's
His position is, "Aight man, somebody bonin' my lady"
Probably snap like Rod-man
My plan was to meet at this bar called the Tiki
(When?)
'Round four, when she was comin' she would beep me
I sat deep in the corner, drinkin' zombies, becomin' one by now
Wonderin' if my style would support her and her child
Out the corner of my eye saw this stud I recognized
(Who?)
One of Smoke's guys, to stay out of sight I tried
Told Jill Scott to meet we coulda picked a better spot
On some nobody's supposed to be here, shit like Deborah Cox
Looked at my watch, shit I don't even got a watch
Felt for my glock, dammit I don't even got a glock, yo
4 minutes to sunrise
Oh baby now, what are we gonna do?
(I don't know)
Pressure is mountin'
Oh baby now, how we gon' get through?

Can't go left and can't go right and
(Uh uh, uh uh)
Don't know, how we made it through the night
(C'mon c'mon)
3 minutes to sunrise
Oh baby now, what are we gonna do?
(Do it, do it)
Pressure puh-pressure what? The pressure's cookin'
It ain't good lookin', like a black promoter I'm talkin' bookin'
Not that I'm spooked of dude, I could whup him
But he was on the horn informin' the rest of them hoodlums
(Aight)
Usually I wouldn't fight over a woman, old girl had a sun-shine
was messed up, on Smoke's payroll was one-time
My pager went off, it read one line, "Come get me
From Halsted", I'm thinkin' this is monkey bar, shit
Went to the phone quick, called her, her line was busy
(What happened?)
Situation number nine, got my mind dizzy
Wondered if this plan was designed to get me
I've been drinkin' too strong to be thinkin' too long
Like 40 goin' North I'm doin' 50, headed for the spot
Askin' God to be with me, and lately
She has been actin' shifty
(But what?)
But then it hit me, it hit me
(Hit me, hit me)
It hit me, it hit me
(Hit me)
2 minutes to sunrise
Oh baby now, what are we gonna do?

Pressure is mountin'
