Earl, whassup Mayne?
It's yo' potnah Short Dawg
You know we come a long way baby
From the ground up
Oh they love the way us players ball
No doubt, that's how we do this
It's all about you Mayne
It's yo' life, let 'em know somethin'
I come from where they pop they collars
And couldn't be saved by Creflo Dollar
'Cause I'll probably never ever see the pearly gates
At the rate I'm goin' now, it'll be too late
Take life taste it, get on and smell it
You know what Charlie is, well it's sucker repellent
I spray myself with it every morning, you dig?
I spray myself right before I leave the crib
Hot ones echo through the ghetto, bullets ricochet
I'm bendin' corners in my Cadillac escalate
It's summertime and I'm scorchin', fuck a bulletproof
I'm hella keyed and I'm perkin' off that num-num juice
I'm in the traffic with my music on storm
Got a ticket just for blowin' my, horn
The real, pinkie ring, princess cut
Carats on, around my neck
Lookin' like some clones, be at yo' best
We don't play checkers no more, we play chess
One trey tri trey double [Incomprehensible]
H I double L sideshow
All about my fetti-oh, one-time want to see me fold
It's ob-vious I'm humongous, acres cars and businesses
All about my fetti-oh, bank account got to be tall
Diamonds on my wrists and shit, tycoon stickin' to the script, beotch
Earl, that's yo' life
Oh Earl, that's yo' life
Earl, that's yo' life
Oh Earl, that's yo' life
Straight up out the game
The realest nigga you done talked to all day
It's the dry season, outsmart the po'-po's
Cookin' birdies in the kitchen, with C-bo
From livin' nappy, everybody know me
Used to sell taffy, white girl nasal candy
Hoes'll dress tacky, just so I can bank they dome
Bank 'em make them think I'm broke
Use the dope game as a steppin' stone
[Incomprehensible] next steal walkie talkies
I'm the one that really-natin' them faulty chips
I got the gift of gab, I'm off the choo choo track
I want the fetti, fuck the fame, y'all can have that
All about my fetti-oh, one-time want to see me fold
It's ob-vious I'm humongous, acres cars and businesses
All about my fetti-oh, bank account got to be tall
Diamonds on my wrists and shit, you can't stop e-feezy beotch
Earl, that's yo' life
Oh Earl, that's yo' life
Earl, that's yo' life
Oh Earl, that's yo' life
The street life, ballin' outta control
My million dollar spot, way too cold
So many record haters, my back against the wall
When I was growin' up I seen a lot of rappers ball
Bring the yellow tape, it's on, on sight
You wanna squash the funk? Shoot me a peace kite
Where the party at? Who got that Carlos Rossi?
Who in my drinkin' club? Girl I'm 'bout to mob somebody
I'm fee-ed-exin', [Incomprehensible]
From sardines and [Incomprehensible]
I looked the game in the eye, the game looked at me back
Told me to sell my triple beam, and start rap
All about my fetti-oh, one-time want to see me fold
It's ob-vious I'm humongous, acres cars and businesses
All about my fetti-oh, bank account got to be tall
Diamonds on my wrists and shit, tycoon stickin' to the script, beotch
Earl, that's yo' life
Oh Earl, that's yo' life
Earl, that's yo' life
Oh Earl, that's yo' life
You know what I said
What'd you say pimpin'?
Short Dawg
Short Deezy
Oh I ride with my potnah
Nigga I ride with you too pimpin'
Bumpin' them woofers like this
Boom boom boom boom!!
Can't smell this funk, we been doin' this
Been doin' it
You know I love these new niggaz man
I love when they get on that paper chase
Right, right, right
So far, they can't do this
Can't do this
Not like this
Uh-huh, nah
We talkin' limousines and mansions
Limousines, mansions
Got to keep these hoes dancin'
Got to keep 'em dancin', dirty dancin'
Bitches love us
They love us, what they do?
They love us
That's right pimpin'
