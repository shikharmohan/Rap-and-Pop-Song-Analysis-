Life
Niggaz used to come and get me
When it was time to disagree with an enemy
Pass the Hennessey it gives me energy
Packed the gat in the small of my back
Where these niggaz at I clear the whole pack
Talkin' shit 'cuz I'm down for my set I'm a vet
Smokin' on a wet cigarette
(Who these niggaz think they are?)
(Wishin' on a ghetto star I represent my tar, [Incomprehensible])
I start bustin' and they scatter like water bugs
'Cuz these Westside niggaz is harder thugs
Enslave us but nothin' can save us from sportin' Ben Davis
Shootin' at your neighbors
('Cuz sometimes I feel like a nut, don't give a fuck when I open ya up)
Hot rocks fly from the back seat
And  busta ass niggaz run like a track meet
And if you crawl in the middle bleed mo' than a little
(What?)
Killer king is the hospital, feelin' numb from the bullets I hum
And when they hit, black mothers have fits, I don't give a shit
Fool, I'm a vet you can bet
That I could dance underwater and not get wet
(Check it)
It's rainin' bullets and I'm still there
(Foe life)
I'm still there
My house shoes get wet from the dew on the grass
Up early in the morning takin' out the trash
Feelin' like a loser alcohol abuser
Two youngsters roll up on a beach cruiser
One on the pedals the other on the handle bars
(What?)
Tryin' be ghetto stars they said
"Are you from the Westside, is it so?"
I said, "Hell yea and who wanna know?
(Me)
In slow mo fo', fo' slugs face down in the mud
Puddle full of blood left for dead
The pain starts to spread now I can't feel my legs
I meet Dr. Who, at King Drew Medical Center
As I enter I.C.U.
He said, "The bullet hit a nerve that was vital"
I said, "I can't move my legs", he said,
"Don't try to, now this ain't the end, my friend"
("What?")
"But you'll probably never walk again"
I sit there motionless holdin' this pain inside contemplating suicide
At night, I jerk and jerk
But my dick don't work, it don't even hurt
(Damn)
Now who'd ever thought a nigga rude as Ice Cube
I be pissin' through a tube
Fool, I'm a vet
Fool, I'm a vet you can bet
That I could dance underwater and not get wet
(Check it)
It's rainin' bullets and I'm still there
Young ghetto nigga in a wheelchair
Fuck a V A they need G A
Gang hospital for a cripple now I'm drinkin' rippal
Same corner same hood I'm still there
With bandanas tied to my wheel chair
To all the hood rat hoes, I'm fired
They mad 'cuz my tongue get tired
Now everybody wanna put they dope on me
Sayin' I won't get searched by the L.A.P.D.
I'm sitting on a doorway, duece five
Dependin' on that to keep my ass alive
I don't got bows but my arm's about a one-six
With fuckin' legs, lookin' like tooth picks
Sometimes I can't deal, got to beg the B G's to roll me up the hill
(C'mon man)
Put me on the porch, now I'm on the torch smokin' cocaine
Just to maintain nutin' to gain, nutin' to lose
And last night I couldn't make it to the bathroom
Feelin' like a two year old, you can't get a sip from the brew I hold
Nigga, its the only friend to a stranger, AKA handicap gang banger
There's a lot in my life I regret becomin' a ghetto vet
Fool, I'm a vet
Fool, I'm a vet you can bet
That I could dance underwater and not get wet
(Check it)
It's rainin' bullets and I'm still there
Young ghetto nigga in a wheelchair
Fool, I'm a vet you can bet
That I could dance underwater and not get wet
(Check it)
It's rainin' bullets and I'm still there
Young ghetto nigga in a wheelchair
Life
Yea
Life
Yea
Life, life
Dedicated to all the ghetto vets
For every nigga that done took one for the hood
