It's all love
I don't eat no meat, no dairy, no sweets
Only ripe vegetables, fresh fruit and whole wheat
I'm from the old school, my household smell like soul food, bro
Curried Falafel, barbecued Tofu
No fish though, no candy bars, no cigarettes
Only ganja and fresh-squeezed juice from oranges
Exercising daily to stay healthy
And I rarely drink water out the tap, 'cause it's filthy
Lentil soup is mental fruit
And ginger root is good for the youth
Fresh veg-e-table with the ital stew
Sweet yam fries with the green calalloo
Careful how you season and prepare your foods
'Cause you don't wanna lose vitamins and miner-ules
And that's the jewel
Life brings life, it's valuable, so I eat what comes
From the ground, it's natural
Let your food be your medicine no exceedin'
Strictly herb, generate in the sun, 'cause I got Melanin
And drink water, eight glasses a day
'Cause that's what they say
They say you are what you eat, so I strive to be healthy
My goal in life is not to be rich or wealthy
'Cause true wealth comes from good health and wise ways
We got to start takin' better care of ourselves
They say you are what you eat, so I strive to be healthy
My goal in life is not to be rich or wealthy
'Cause true wealth comes from good health and wise ways
We got to start taking better care of ourselves, be healthy y'all
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hold the fuck up, yo
We'll take this little intermission, listen what the
Fuck we gotta say, y'know?
Word is bond son, niggaz been livin' fat for too long, knowamsayin'?
Smokin' bogeys, fuckin' drinkin' all types of shit
Wailin' out, not givin' a fuck what they puttin' in they
Bodies, son, knowamsayin'?
'Bout time niggaz start thinkin' about that shit, son, knowamsayin'?
That shit is fuckin', makin' us deteriorate, son
Word up, we gotta care 'bout our little babies an shit, son
Niggaz got kids to raise, straight up
Ya gotta start learnin'' yo self, learning 'bout ya health, son
Learnin' this world we live in, kid, knowamsayin'?
It's time to start changin' all that shit god, word up
So I'm gonna leave y'all niggaz on some shit like that, ya knowamean?
Word up, y'all niggaz better start usin' y'all minds an shit, kid
Peace
