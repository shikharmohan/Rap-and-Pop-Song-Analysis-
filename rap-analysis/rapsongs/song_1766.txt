Masters at work
Touch of jazz, collabo
Take time to make time
For all things work out so perfectly
There is a place I often
Close my eyes and drift off to
Where time stands still and it feels
As if I'm floating on a cloud now
In this place there are no burdens
Of the world to trouble me no
I become one with the rhythm
Caught by the spirit in love
With the beat, yeah, yeah
I start dancing to the rhythm of my own drum
Sweating away all my urban blues
And in that instant moment
The fast things of the rat race are left behind
And right now it could be sweeter I'm just passing time
I'm telling you we should
Take time to make time
All things work out perfectly
I'm telling you about
Take time to make time
All things work eventually
Take time, so relax your mind
Everything works out
When things don't seem to go your way
(It's okay)
You have to be patient humble you must stay
I know that you might not want to wait
But don't give up, no
(Don't be afraid)
Find the energy inside to stand up
('Cause you can't hide)
Adversity over come your fears with faith
And you will see you can stand up
On your own two feet
If you just be free, just be free
Hold on and make sure that we
Take time to make time
All things work out perfectly
I'm telling you, your time is my time
All things work eventually, time
So relax your mind, relax your mind
Take time
(Take time)
To make time
(Just to make time)
All things work out perfectly
(They work out so perfectly)
Your time is my time, all things work eventually
Take time, so relax your mind
Just relax your mind
Take time to make time
All things work out perfectly
Take time to make time
All things work out perfectly
Take time to make time
Take time to make time
All things work out perfectly
Your time is my time
All things work eventually
Take time, take time
Get in the groove, take time to get in the groove
Take time to make time, relax your mind
Take time, relax your mind
Take time to relax your mind
