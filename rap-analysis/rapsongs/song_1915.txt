Now I gotta deal with this shit
Aiyyo, ya niggaz must be outcha fuckin' mind
Thinkin' dog can't pull another motherfuckin' rabbit out the hat
Nigga, I ain't gotta check out my motherfuckin' sleeves
You bitch ass niggaz
Fuck is y'all niggaz
Y'all niggaz just thinkin' I'm sittin' around doin' nothin'?
Oh my God, y'all niggaz can't be serious
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
All them niggaz actin' up, where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
All them niggaz actin' up, where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that
Yo, yo, yo
Man, cats don't know what it's gonna be
Fuckin' with a nigga like me, D-to-the-M-to-the-X
Last I heard, y'all niggaz was havin' sex with the same sex
I show no love to homo thugs
Empty out, reloaded and throw more slugs
How you gonna explain fuckin' a man?
Even if we squashed the beef, I ain't touchin' ya hand
I don't fuck with chumps for those to been to jail
That's the cat with the Kool-Aid on his lips and pumps
I don't fuck with niggaz that think they broads
Only know how to be one way, that's the dog
I know how to get down, know how to bite
Bark very little but I know how to fight
I know how to chase a cat up in the tree
Man, I give y'all niggaz the business for fuckin' wit me
Is you crazy?
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
All them niggaz actin' up, where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
All them niggaz actin' up, where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that
Yo, yo, yo
Once a song, I come though, guns is drawn
Blam blam, lungs is gone, sons will mourn
From dusk till dawn, nighttime belongs to the dog
When the street passed midnight, look for 'em in the morgue
Don't play with these cats 'cause I ain't got nothin' to say to these cats
For the mothers that really do love 'em, please pray for these cats
'Cause I know niggaz is hardheaded but I ain't got the patience
Don't want me havin' no patience turn into more patience
More trips to I.C.U 'cause I see you
Tryna get away with shit a real nigga wouldn't do
Where my dogs at? Right here
See them niggaz? Right where?
Get 'em boy! Right there
That's how we do, aight then
This is for my dogs, this is for my dogs
Yo, where we at baby? Creepin' through the fog
From then till now, don't ask me how
Know that we gon' roll like them niggaz
And hit every block on the job
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
All them niggaz actin' up, where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
All them niggaz actin' up, where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that
Yo, yo, yo
I did tapes doin' crimes, stop niggaz like grapes makin' wine
Five CD's with mad rhymes
Don't hit me with that positive shit, I know you lyin'
You really wanna stop niggaz from dyin'? Stop niggaz from tryin'
'Cause I ain't really got that time to waste
And I thought I told you to get these fuckin' bums out my face
Lookin' atchu in your grill, I might be nice to cut
Once I split ya ass in two, you'll be twice as butt
Yeah, you right, I know ya style, pussy, 'cause I'm fuckin' it
Since we all right here, you hold my dick while he suckin' it
Motherfucker, don't you know you'll never come near me
Shove ya head up ya ass, have you seein' shit clearly
Never heard that D be runnin', 'cause D be gunnin'
I beat my dick and bust off in ya eye so you can see me comin'
Empty clips and shells are what I leave behind
And if they get me with the joint
They hit me with a three-to-nine
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
All them niggaz actin' up, where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
All them niggaz actin' up, where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that
What
Where the fuckin' hood at?
No ones' fuckin' with me nigga, for real
I am the hood, I am the streets
You bitch ass nigga
Take it how you want, motherfucker
I'm in the hood all day
I think I'm like the only nigga, dog
That can go to the projects
He's doing all by his fuckin' self and be good
Yeah nigga, ask niggaz on my projects Y.O.
When the last time they seen dog, motherfucker
Dee, waah, ugh, Kato
Where the hood at?
