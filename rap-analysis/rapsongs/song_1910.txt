Shit, and this shit right here...will get you mugged in the street
Beanie seagal
Beanie segal hit hard, and I'll wire ya jaw
Trademark niggas eyes, give them perminant scars
Twist backwards, never catch me rollin' cigars
Only cock and blow, dro out of perservative jars
On the block serving like I never heard of the law
Cops hit the spot fuck it, mad bro to bar
Fuck crack, flip powder, I ain't takin' a loss
Plus if I get snatched, it's less time for the song
I was been known to stroll the block, hold the glock
Blow dro, pick up doe, reload the spot
I'm the shit with crushed ice and some arm and hammer
I'm the reason why smokers steal car antenna's
I get bricks, so you know I make big nicks
The size of chiclets, that make you pricks sick
While you try to profit, I just flip quick
Ya niggas know my flow be sick, my doe be quick
Infra red
Now when you wake upi'm wiping the cold out your eys with the barrel of the gun
Holding your son, smoking branson
Blowing smoke in your face, I want the ransom and some
His shit'll get the opposite of handsomei mean I got to come clean
I've done bagged up and served every fiend mc in the feds magazine
I'm what y'all haven't seeni swallow kerosene and piss out gassoline
Strike a match and burn the fucking scene
I'm no joker - I could blow you in the smoke
And make your man a second hand smoker.
I'm so vulgar - I'm sendin' niggas straight back to their maker
Broke, with a playstation for a cd player, see me player? 
I don't even play that shiti just spit and have the whole hood sayin' my shit
Yall got a bible? well pray in that shit
While I smoke a scripture, reload, niggas come to rip ya
Nuchild
Peep the illest shit that I ever wrote
Gun up in your mouth, hands around your throatchoke nigga choke, I'm dope
Roll me up and smoke, on contactniggas react, and play me back
For doe, I'll murder ever nigga not on this track
I spit back, at any nigga claimin' he teflon
The best don? be the next nigga get stepped on
A sick dude, type to ask God "you wanna battle? "
"i could care less, send me hell I like to travel"after waxin' him, I wax you
Smack you, clap you, and thats twoniggas I left lookin' like statues
I have to, bring it to these cowards that talk hard
Some jail shit? never even walked through a junk yardi thump hard
Make a nigga yell for crew quicka true bitch, eat a nigga up like a chew-stick
Too rich, is what I plan to be in the 9-9
Its all mine, fagots ride bench when it's crunch time
So bump mine, make a nigga lean off the opiumyou ethiopian
Willie niggas, we scoping 'em, and roping 'emdo a nigga rosewood style
Hangin' by his weak picture, callin' his moms and his child
Mysonne
Its mysonne, lefty, gun up in the right palm
Poppin' niggas in their sleep so they die calm
Kill or be killed, thats the that I'm on
Its desparoto style, shooting at them side armi'm bomb, see I'm dope like heroin
And my guns got scopes, so they zero infrom here on in, know I fear no men
And mutherfuck shootin' five, here go ten
Know that if you start a problem, there's no end
You tough? fight death and be a hero then
Niggas call me poppiseed, I'll pop your seed
And move bricks on the block thats too hot to breath
I'm a real type of nigga, that cock and squeeze
Y'all them second guess fagots, that cock and freeze
So I fuck with real niggas, like the lox and d
And y'all niggas got problems, just watch and see
Drag-on
I'm the kid with the unlaced boots, but'll lace you
Leave a hole in your facial, the size of a bagel
All my bullets hit, never graze youif you never was shit, i'ma promise you this
I'ma front page you, i'ma young'n
The first one there, and the last one to get to running
Unless you tell me the cops coming
'cause I like to feel assed out, so when they trap me I blast out
I'm quiet my gun gotta bad mouthi wake up with the mad south
You know how many chinks and jews drag's done dragged out, on a cash route? 
'cause when I walk in, stop the talking
I don't give a fuck if it's a nigga with a walkmani'ma put him in a coffin
Soon as I step ini'm runnin' up on the nigga with the thick lens
I'm tryin to get the benz with the thick rims
Double r, soon half of us'll goto jailthe rest? the studio, 16 bars to post bail
