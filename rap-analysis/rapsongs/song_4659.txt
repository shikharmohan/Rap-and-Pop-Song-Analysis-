{Wassup ya?
This is free and today I have the pleasure
Of grillin' and talkin' to the one an' only LL Cool J
Welcome LL, how you doin'?
What's so free was gonna be
Oh good, tell me, how to behave with you?
We're on the verge of a tenth album
Temp Joint
From LL
Ya Temp Joint, feel great about it
Ya
Happy, you know what I am sayin'
So yell me what this album means to you
It's like a milestone in my career, it's just
An opportunity to just show the world
That you can do anything you put your mind to
Because I'm being, you know
It just kind of makes me think about when I first signed a
Signed a Def Jam and my first album
And my first deal was for ten albums
Were okay?
And, here I am, you know, my Temp album
Just like we talked about
It's, it's amazing}
