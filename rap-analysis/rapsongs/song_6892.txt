[Chorus: (Scratching) "Where tha phukk you at?" (Repeat)]
[Opio]
Women are so conniving
but they liven me up
inviting
succulent breasts
bustin' through that dress
impress me and Phes
hold up turn around so we can see the rest
yes
what a dame
a mothaphukkin' shame
what's ya name
you look fantastic
she responded enthusiastic
was it the fame (naaaw)
they all the same
what's the difference in this plastic
no drastic measures
just for pleasure, laughs, kicks
conversation was simple
she liked my dimples
asked me when will I be leaving town
it's goin' down
I said tomorrow
a look of sorrow crossed her face
but I'm an ace
?_____? shot out to the hotel for the satin lace
treatment
Victoria's Secrets
get me weak in the knees
baby please don't tease me
she put the squeeze on me
had me whipped
a tight grip
the perfect fit I flipped
I couldn't handle it
shot 'em out but now I want 'em back
baby doll tell me where the phuk you at. . .
[Tajai]
Yeah, now this shit here sounds like some interlusion
so let me kick some ludeness
slackness
I wish I had a bitch that practiced
gymnastics
and when I hit it from the back this girl
would twirl and twist and fat lips
and make the johnson vibrate like a tonsil
plus on the tonsils
honeyboo be on the job
and if I try to hang she be like a bat outta Hades
phuk around get with the nigga my lady
I want a bitch that's ?_____?
maybe glaze me in some cherries and heavy syrup
but neva no reigns see and neva no stirrups (naaah)
none of that S and M
just undressin' when
it's appropriate and even when it's not
cause she hot, so...
[Chorus]
[A-Plus]
I knew this nigga that was bigga than life
pullin' the trigga and knifes
he'd stick up in ya in fights (and he was)
the kind of nigga causin' pain and static
when you seen him he would make you wanna aim your 'matic
but that is not happenin'
that nigga got back
cause if you shot at him
80 niggas would be on your block cappin'
he had family
understand me
and he know popo know he make his dough sellin' candy
he got friends in high places
white men in skyscrapers
I bet they help him beat his 5 cases
untouched a true mack indeed
he'd pull a mac and bleed
he made a stack from crack and weed
he phuckked up the fact is
the nigga tried to duck taxes
now he at that "Ahw nigga you, punk" status
federal pen with non-heteral men
climbin' ya front to back
aw nigga where the phuk ya at
[Phesto]
I like them ripe hips
to slide in
after the shows we rock these
I'm captivatin' hoes to wax and they attract me
I see that lookin' in my eyes with fascination
mesmerized
so I'm buckin' them thighs
for a visit later she replied
yes
to see her undressed
I just couldn't deny 'cause she possessed
the most voluptuous
ass and D cups
it was almost too much for just me
I said what's up with us
we got in the cut and let the lust erupt
scandalous as she did me justice
with them lucious lips
givin' a nigga rushes
with the slightest touches but bust this
now I gotta live with the repercussions
corruption
she raised up when I dazed under the assumption
she could be trusted
now I'm like what's this
flustered
left for broke all 'cause this
hoe I'll probably never see again
had a motive and
got me for my dough
so all I really wanna know
is bitch...
[Chorus]
