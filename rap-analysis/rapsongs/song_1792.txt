Boom boom boom ATF who the fuck is they?
Dog is the nigga that's gonna walk through the night
Park the car 20 blocks way and walk to the fight
Nigga where the fuck I want 'cuz New York is alright

Everything from get at me dog to what's my name

For as long as I let is last shit niggaz
Put out I be wrong if I let it pass
Think that shit is hot bitch just because
You said it fast, I'm about to get it fast
You pumped up on leaded gas
Don't keep goin' where you goin', it's a dead end
Before niggaz catch you at the door
Tryin' to get in, keep tryin' to fit in
Four pounds spit in get what you put in
Bullshit for bit in, stop talkin' wreckless

Stay pullin the thing out what you gonna do without it
No I wanna know for real what y'all gonna do without it?
We done tested y'all niggaz, arrested y'all niggaz
Straight out double vested y'all niggaz
And it was only outta love

And my niggaz are blastin' y'all fucked up
Be careful where you walkin'

Please don't make me please don't mistake me
Make me angry, love me or hate me
Niggaz can't break me
So don't walk too fast or talk too much
'Cuz y'all niggaz is askin' and you know whassup
'Cuz y'all niggaz are blastin' weed like what
And my niggaz are blastin' y'all fucked up
