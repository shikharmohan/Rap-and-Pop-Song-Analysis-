Yo man glorious
This is protected
By the Red
And Tical
Slap it down
Way out of bounds
Throw in your towels
Fo' we gun down
Yo, flipmode, toilet bowls explode
When Doc come drop a shit load
Grip fo's
Mushrooms, did those
Deep pistol
Whip hoes
I bitch O's
Money, roll, I stick a zip code
Tiptoed, before Doc hit skid row
Thirsty, sniffin' out a pig nose
My Benz built with wings and 6-0's
My flows is North Pole cold
My hands got area's that fits snow
Doc, fixin' hoes in disco's
My dogs let 'em walk with ripped clothes
Shows, niggas pack 6 rolls
We're losin' 'em
His hart won't get pulse
Pack you bags off a 10 percent doze
I could hum and shit cold
Yo, yo tear the roof off
Yo, yo tear the roof off
Back off, don't make me shoot y'all
You don't want to fuck with us, you don't
I get scanned, rip sand
With this stick style
Pistol, lick ground
Get off my dick now
Kick crowd, hot style
You-get-shot-style
Timid, scared to get in it
These dogs is rock rowd
Unchained, untained, you know my name
Act strange, pack flame
It's not a game
Just ill flows, that kills shows
You can feel yo
Kickin' in you do', like a steel toe for real do'
Y'all gon' learn I spit germs
When you come showin' on Big Worm
You gets burned
Punks don't get turned, they get done
And get sun, come get some
The last victim lye in a ditch
Now who wanna fuck with Hot Nick
Niggas chew gum with they ass and pop shit
Me and Funk Doc get, toxic
A bowl of rice and some chopsticks
Go make your Wu just imposters
Yo, yo tear the roof off
Yo, yo tear the roof off
Back off, don't make me shoot y'all
You don't want to fuck with us, you don't
You try to O.K Corel
With Doc and Methical
Bar saloon fight without weapons out
Strechmarks like Belly on Kevin Lous
One yard to score, only second down
Hoes play wifey, wanna settle down
Try to lock cash, bitch better bounce
Boyfriend jumpin', Meth shut 'em down
Pound to echo loud, bout 7 miles
Doc, dirty Jersey, hunt 'em down
Uncut rhymes, won't even fit your foul
Baddest man out the bunch, pick 'em out
Drunk with a gun, miss you hit the crowd
Snitches, someone kiss to stitch you mouth
Wilder then rhinos or liquor trous
Mrs. how Mary-Ann, dig 'em out
Ginger watch with the gun and skip a mouth
Love the ruckas and love to dish it out
3 watched MC's, start wristin' out
Get your whole camp put on the missile foul
Pushin' 12 out, bumpin' digital
Yo, yo tear the roof off
Yo, yo tear the roof off
Back off, don't make me shoot y'all
You don't want to fuck with us, you don't
Method Man
We just ice
Men of mice, ain't nothing nice
Redman
Fuck your life
Method Man
Your tight, just light to fight
We move right, on fright night
When niggas right
We bust pipe, condo's that suck tight
We all right, you all hype and war's right
In the source, with half mic, you half life
And half dead, blasted on glass bed
I'm past dead, eyes red, the hash head
Burn somethin', earn somethin' and learn somethin'
Take my turn frontin'
Def Jam ain't heard nothin' yet
Suspect, ruff necks
Buck 'em down or you get busted
Never leave home without my muskett
Trust this, out for justice, clown
And caught on Judgment Day, call Joe Brown
Take MC's to town if they start blawn
Ashes to ashes, they all fall down
Master these bastards with hazardous tactics
Semi automatic full rap metal jacket
Blasted in plastic your brain on the mattress
All you kids is ass backwards and visa versa
Yo, yo tear the roof off
Yo, yo tear the roof off
Back off, don't make me shoot y'all
You don't want to fuck with us, you don't
Come on, yo tear the roof off
Nigga, yo tear the roof off
Back off, don't make me shoot y'all
You don't want to fuck with us, you don't
Huh
Yo, you don't want to fuck with us
You don't
Yo, You don't want to fuck with us
You don't
