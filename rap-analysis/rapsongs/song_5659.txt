When I think of home, I think of a place where there is
We all got to have a place where we come from
This place that we come from is called home
We set out on our travels, we do the best we can
We travel this big earth as we roam
We all got to have some place that we come from
This place that we come from is called home
An' even though we may love, this place on the map
Said, "It ain't where ya from, it's where ya at"
I come up in the street around some real wild brothers
With more than one name an' more than one baby mother
More than one chase, been on more than one run
Got more than one enemy an' more than one gun
[Incomprehensible]
While these cats that's less privileged is just more raw
Less space 'cause the projects laced with more flaws
Less sleep 'cause the nights ain't peace, it's more war
The can is raw like thirsty, rainy season thunder claps
On the block with your old pop, pleadin' number act
To the spot with the red top fiends is huddled at
To the crib where the little kids spend their summers trapped
With the jungle cats, lions an' tigers, leopards an' cheetahs
For gazelle, you get chased like a zebra, they blaze cheeba cheeba
An' dominate the weaker on the street
Hungry bellies only love what they eat an' it's hard to compete
When they smilin' with your heart in they teeth
An' the odds is stacked high beyond an' beneath
Son, I been plenty places in my life an' time
An' regardless where home is, son, home is mine
We all got to have a place where we come from
This place that we come from is called home
We set out on our travels, we do the best we can
We travel this big earth as we roam
We all got to have some place where we come from
The place that we come from is called home
Even though we may love, this place is on the map
Said, "It ain't where ya from, it's where ya at"
Some people live out in New York City
Some people live in Atlanta
Some people got to live, Chicago
Some people do live, Miami
All my people at California
An' other people got to live, London
An' everybody got to live in the whole big world
Together just you an' me
When I think of home, my remembrance of my beginnin'
Laundromat helpin' ma dukes fold the bed linen
Chillin' in front of my building with my brother an' them
Spendin' nights in Bushwick with my cousins an' them
Wise town an' Beat Street, federal relief
Slowly meltin' in the mornin' grits we used to eat
Stickin' to your teeth an' teeth is hard to keep
With every flavor, 'Now an' Later' only a dime apiece
Old timers on the bench playin' cards an' thangs
Tellin' tales about they used to be involved in things
Start to drinkin', talkin' loud, cussin' up an' showin' out
On the phone, call the cops, pick 'em up, move 'em out
An' it's all too common to start wildin'
I'm a pirate on an island, seekin' treasure known as silence
An' it's hard to find block parties in dark lobbies
Funeral homes packed, but only dark bodies
I can't sleep hardly, stirred up like Bob Marley
Marley Marl played the symphony, remember we recall
Son, I been to many places in my space an' time
An' whatever my home is, son, home is mine
We all got to have a place where we come from
This place that we come from is called home
We set out on our travels, we do the best we can
We travel this big earth as we roam
Said, "We all got to have some place where we come from
This place that we come from is called home
Even though we may love, this place is on the map"
Said, "It ain't where ya from, it's where ya at"
Said, "It ain't where ya from, it's where ya at"
Said, "It ain't where ya from, it's where ya at"
Said, "It ain't where ya from, it's where ya at"
Said, "It ain't where ya from, it's where ya at"
Said, "It ain't where ya from, it's where ya at"
It's where ya at
