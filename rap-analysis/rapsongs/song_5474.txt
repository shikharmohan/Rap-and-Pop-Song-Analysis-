Like your name is Missy Elliot
My name is Fantasia Barrino
And what I can give, is Fantasia Barrino
Holla at your girl
Two thousand five, whoo
Wake up in the mornin' with my man next to me
Up all night like we've been on that ecstasy
Mixed with Hennessey, he got the remedy
Yeah my nigga into me, I can't say it simply
We, take a quick shower for the hour conversation
Time to have relation, love makin' in the basement
Smack it up, flip it up, crush it
One minute, two minute, I was no question
Who would ever think that I'd be givin' up the goodies
Walkin' 'round naked in a pair of pink footies
Just like them hoes at the shows
Half-dressed clothes doin' whatever, who knows
Nah, I only get freaky with him
No menage-a-trois, not freaky with them
It's just me and my man
Yes, said me and my man
4 my man, I'll do whatever
'Cause what I feel, this love, it make me do thangs
4 my man, I'll last forever
'Cause what I feel, this love, it won't never change
I'm never insecure when we not together
Even though he tell me he in love with Ciara
I'm from a new era and I bring terror
To any chick who check my fella when we together, so
He treat me like a Cinderella, yup
Protect me from the storm like he my umbrella
This fella deserve primo stellar, he be a Roc-A-Fella
Not to Jay-Z and Dame but the charm on the chain be platinum
Jacob Roley lookin' sporty, [Incomprehensible]
Money stackin' keep track and I fax him
If I can't find his ass then his ass out of gas
He only gettin' one pass
My man, is my man and nobody else's
Damn right, I hope y'all felt this
Old ladies 'round the coast-es
You better get focuses 'fore you ever try to approacheth
4 my man, I'll do whatever
'Cause what I feel, this love, it make me do thangs
4 my man, I'll last forever
'Cause what I feel, this love, it won't never change
See when you in love you might have to say it
Don't say you won't, never say you won't
You might get real mad, wan' act all bad
Act up in the street, a few chicks you gotta beat
'Cause they disrespect
Clockin' your man from his feets to his neck, uhh
You gotta let her know that's a no-no, slap her real slow
With a right blow whichever way it go and keep it gangster
Show these bitches that you can't come
Yank 'em, point blank 'em, top rank 'em
I ride for my nigga and I'm happy with the trigger
Scared how you figure?
My man, say it time again
Say my man, my man again
I say my man, it's just me and my man
Said for me and my man
4 my man, I'll do whatever
'Cause what I feel, this love, it make me do thangs
4 my man, I'll last forever
'Cause what I feel, this love, it won't never change
That's my man
Yes it is
This love
