Hey, do you know what letter comes after I
"What do the Jungle Brothers call it? The jimbrowski"
"It's jimmy, it's jimmy"
Hook (Jungle Brothers):
She always cry when I tell her that I'll be goin' back on the road again
Tears in her eyes tell me that I'm the man someday she'll be marryin'
Verse 1 (Afrika):
Beggin' me to bring you back home
Out wonderin' why why ya home all alone
Feenin' for the jimmy, feenin' for my love
Fixed and addicted to each other like a drug
Nothin' like some acid or some ecstacy
I give you pieces of my love so you'll remember me
Love letters in the mail show me that you still care
I reminisce about the kiss that turned into a love affair
I tell you now I didn't mean to do you harm
But your love was gettin' to me and my jimmy
"got hot when I..."
(Bridge):
My jimmy weighs a ton (4X)
Verse 2 (Mike G.):
Mike G the honey hunter not at all the honey sweater
Chillin' on the corner when I have ?
Sweet, sweet ? only angels look betta
But I ain't that jet so I best to go get her
Hey ? she said what you want it to be
Cause I've been waitin' a while for you to come get with me
Oooh, ahhh, she touched my heart
This could be the sign of a wonderful start
Cause my love is that deep
To some it is a treat
Playin' me for keeps
Ball and chain at my feet
But I got a curfew
But baby I don't want to have to hurt you
She said she want to run away with me
But that can't be (Nah, G)
Cause I was sixteen and she was twenty-three
Hook (female singer):
I always cry when you tell me that you'll be goin' back on the road again

Uhhhh, uhhhh, uhhhhh
"Got hot when I...."

My jimmy weighs a ton (4X)
Verse 3 (Afrika):
Love is a gamble, life is a lesson
By golly when I met you you made a good impression
on me
You wasn't all about playin' those games
(She wasn't all about playin' those games)
You said I wanna be your girl, get to know ya
But I already got a girl I told ya
She said You got the love that I want now bring it to me
She caught me off guard, I started singin' to her
Hook (female singer):
I always cry when you tell me that you'll be goin' back on the road again
Tears in my eyes tell me that you're the man someday I'll be marryin'
