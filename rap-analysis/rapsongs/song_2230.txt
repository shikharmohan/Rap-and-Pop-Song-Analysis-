Elite alloy candy coated custom paint, Verizon wireless phone
Jacob watch with interchangeable bands and five time zones
Tryin' to holla at a redbone, smokin' on some cactus
Sippin' on some super duper extra strength
A buck fifty, a shot Louie, the thirteenth
Head hard as a rock, stop by the barber shop
Shoot some craps in the back then hit the block
There go the Elroys, they handcuffin' my boys
They fittin' to take 'em to the prestink
Couldn't say they ABC's backward, so?
Shoot, I can't say my ABC's backwards when I'm sober
E-Figgady, a different pedigree than most of these suckers
Up in this industry be trying to copy me
Trend setta, game markin' decta, Vendetta, big chedda
Soil block protectas
Hey, hey, ey
Fuck rallies, ride gold ones mang
Sick wid it, nigga, what you claim?
My niggaz spit gasoline
Hey, hey, ey
Fuck rallies, ride gold ones mang
Sick wid it, nigga, what you claim?
My niggaz spit gasoline
Never low on gas, never on an empty tank
High octane for the brain, puffin' on some dank
Traffic backed up like a toilets do, bumper to bumper
Music on slap, sounding like a concert
Drink in my lap, finger on my thumper
Twist wig back, head crack, flat line, alpine, deck
Rolla supplier, quiet as it's kept
I wanna retire but I can't, the game needs me
The game would be boring without E-Feezy
I wake up every morning to a shot of liquor
A shoebox full of herb and some grits and turkey sausage
For my liver, sellin' units out the trunk of my car
And just think, I started with a pickle jar
From a sixteenth of yowder to a quarter kick of blow
To a whole thing of some of that, you know
Hey, hey
Fuck rallies, ride gold ones mang
Sick wid it, nigga, what you claim
My niggaz spit gasoline
Hey, hey
Fuck rallies, ride gold ones mang
Sick wid it, nigga, what you claim
My niggaz spit gasoline
Yo, yo, yo
I'm close, I'm doing the most, I flamboast
I coast, take my foot off the brake
Then I casper the friendly ghost up the interstate
Gettin' neck motion, deep throat, honey, 'bout to choke
I got brigadels to see, marbles to make
Drop the prices from state to state like the West Nile Virus
Prolly gammas miralicious, big spit, game vicious
Man on the microphigadelian foshelian
It's nothin' but the forty water
Always on, uh, some unreasonable
Can't fuck wit' it, if it ain't equinomically, um, er, uh, ta, uh, feasible
Me and my weoples stay yaypered up
Got a just say no to drug bumper sticker on my truck
And an American flag so I can camouflage my image
I'm smokin' on some spinach
I need to play some tennis before I go to court
The water might be finished if he don't report
Hey, hey
Fuck rallies, ride gold ones mang
Sick wid it, nigga, what you claim
My niggaz spit gasoline

Hey, hey
Fuck rallies, ride gold ones mang
Sick wid it, nigga, what you claim
My niggaz spit gasoline
Gasoline, gasoline, gasoline, gasoline
Gasoline, gasoline, gasoline, gasoline
Gasoline, gasoline, gasoline, gasoline
Gasoline, gasoline, gasoline, gasoline
