Hah cocoa yo, ya ya yo

(Lady)
All day

I need some cut
(Lady, lady)
Now these doors don't open, til after dark
(Owoo)
And it ain't 'til twelve 'til the party really starts
(Yo, me and my crew had to be in by ten)
Right before the fun was about to begin
Yo yo, one bitten jabberjaws tryin' to taste the
Paper written kids be bullshittin' I see they flaws
Too many rebels not enough cause for me to pause
(Haha)
Them broads love my shitty drawers the finest
Criminal minded put my life behind it you niggaz
Find it hard to swallow poison in the bottle
(She too sexy)
So I gotta watch you fast bitches too many tricks
That can give a dick a bad sickness
Yo, yo yo son excuse me?
(Yo)
I'm tryin' to earn a million buck or two
The ill MC step in
(And who the fuck are you?)
Doc start walkin' bumpin' M.O.P
To catch a nigga gettin' gassed, puttin' ten on three
(Da ruckus)
With the mic I blast men on sight
So off the hook Atlantic, Bell had to go on strike
Doc did it metaphors come  kitted
Twenty-twenty vision comes tinted from being so high
(So high)
So high so high
Air it out
Iron lung I be the street soldier ante up
Pull them panties up, party's over, in the cut
Slappin' grudges offa niggaz shoulder bringin' ruck
Like them wild cats at Villanova hot as fuck
Duke or sober suave bowler soul controller
Of the universe stole a colder than cola
Caps grab your hoodie hat island of stat'
Keep them cats runnin' for they gat, in stormy weather
Gats, right hook, uppercut swollen how I left your eye
Stage dived, made a mistake, kicked F.O.I
Aiyyo hoe doc be keepin a dope show like Marilyn
Manson the handgun be stashed in the panelling
Jersey drop son watch me whip it like midget
Diggin' in that whole plate and piss on your picnic
(Don't nobody move)
Don't nobody start flinchin'
Limo driver roll up the fuckin' partition
Who them niggaz that be rollin' them Thai, high as a kite?
Gettin' pussy all nite

And so on

Snatch spark to the ignition, I'm screwin' it in
(Aiyyo we out!)
Six drop in ten seconds, what?
I'll be the first one on the floor at your wedding reception
B boys gather around and act p noid
Bring the trouble T roy, to earlobes, keyloid
(Terminator two)
Doc after Sarah conn'
For the barrel bonds
(Am I on?)
Tical, you're on
Uhh uhh on, uhh uhh on
Uh uh uh uh uh, uh uh on
Got these slim pickin's on my Charles Dickens I pack a Mac
To make your back stiffen flip the script I act different
The eyeball keep your distance warning y'all you don't listen
Bitchin' over shit you ain't gettin'
So finally puttin' in work the big hurt
MC with a social disease and get it first
Enemies feel my energies four centuries of anger
Remember me?
(The field nigga)
Too ghetto fabulous rza, sharp, and hazardous
Figure with bad habit can't hold his liquor
Speed like a millipede
(Hot nix-on)
Contemplate the non-fiction on loose leaves
Paragraphs, hundred degrees, my pen bleed
(Ha)
Showin' you the pain I feel from holdin' these
Black thoughts, deep rooted, nowadays
They come with batteries included, in wicked ways
Who them niggaz that be rollin them thai, high as a kite?
Gettin pussy all nite
(Well all rite cha)
Yeah yeah
Well who them cats you can call on, when you wanna brawl?
(Get drunk as hell)
And so on
(Well all rite cha)
Yo yo

Bricks to stat' hold it down
