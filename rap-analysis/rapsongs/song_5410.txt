Yeah, damn
Timbaland, we 'bout to lace 'em one more time
Say what?
Damn, Timbaland, yeah
We 'bout to lace 'em one more time
Alright, yeah
The M I to the S S
They put that on my chest
My car's the way that I flex
And people say I'm dope as fuck
They say I'm just too fly
I make 'em wanna get high
They want a piece of this pie
But I'm just too damn chill for them
No way I flip my shit
It feels like a good hit
And even if you buy it
Nigga, you can't get smokin' in this hay
Nigga, what you got to say?
Iza bah bah zah zay
Iza zah zah zah zay
We ridin' through your hood
With a dollar dank
And a SLK and a 348, what 9
Two bad niggas, from the big VA
Twelve blunts a day
Chillin' on the other side of the bay
Who y'all think y'all is
Tryin' to get with Mis?
You tryin' to dis
You think you can beat us, shit
Free them till 1 to 12
She's in a Benz, free them ill creators
Just, I'm a friend, what?
I come back into my flow
My people just don't know
They hate the way that I hee
They hate the way that I hee-haw
'Cause I got too much doe
You know my steelo
So what you come here for
See, you don't wanna fuck with me
Get it off your chest
You know who's the best
See, there's no other yes
That can get down like Missy
So hit you off like this
And you be the witness
That I'm a sure gets dick
Nigga what, nigga what, nigga what, nigga what?
Hey, yo Timbaland
Yo, I'm a just sue
Dance a little bit
You don't mind if I get my boogie on do you?
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'?
We don't gotta rhyme through the whole track
The track is bangin' by itself
Know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
They don't want
To fuck with me
