Yo, I need to wait
Tarantula, tarantula, boof, handle yo' bidness
Then nigga
Mystikal wassup nigga
Whoa, wassup dog
Funk doctor in this mother-fucker
Right here
And I'm shitty ass Meth, and we gone do what
The fuck we gotta do
I get it started for you, I get it started for you
Soon as I get'cha 'cause I know that you was waitin' for me
I get it started for you, I get it started for you
Soon as I get'cha 'cause I know that you was waitin' for me
Yo, yo, yo
If school was pussy, I wouldn't miss a day
Big John Jay slay around the way, fish fillet
Taste the truth, ay' no more lies like Michel'le
Keep my kids frost like they was born in East L.A.
Told yo' buy yo' weed by the ounce, twins let's bi-dounce
That shit they talkin' don't add up, I say what get down
Can't stop drop, can't flock, most of all I can't stop
Wreck my hand-cuffs and fightin' bullies in the sandbox
Method-cal, Mystikal, oh yeah, that's my man doc'
Wolf in sheep's clothin', wha, hit you with the lamb chop
Throw 'em up, slow 'em up, light the wic blow C1
