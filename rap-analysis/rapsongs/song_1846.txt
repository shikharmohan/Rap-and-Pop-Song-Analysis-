Here comes the boom, boomin', bouncin', stalkin' much walkin'
Walk with the bouncin', hit 'em where it counts man
Hit 'em like a mountain
Split 'em, have 'em spittin' up blood like a fountain
Look at me like that we just might fight back
And if I might end up in me takin' your life back
I don't go for the bullshit 'cause divin' down
And time is just too important to be fuckin' around
Chump nigga, I stomp a mud hole in your face
Muthafucka, rip your butthole outta place
Cock the glock to your head, let off about two in it
Yea, it's a dirty job but I just love doin' it
