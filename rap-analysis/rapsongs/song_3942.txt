C'mon dice, c'mon dice
Throw on a Hollyhood Wear by Lil' Kim
You know the Queen Bee known for doin' it way big
We take trips to Mekenos, Greece
Just to shop, we don't stop doin' it way big
This is for my millionaire club golfers
Comin' up like Halle and Denzel, winnin' the Oscars
Y'all get y'all diamonds from Jacob, I ain't mad at ya
I get mine straight out the Kimberly Gold Mine in Africa
I smack niggaz 'cross the face with a Centurion card
Who don't believe, I'm doin' it way big
In the Continental T, Magnolia B, man, she doin' it way big
I'm comin' through Hummer stuntin', and I'm frontin'
Workin' that Burkein Ermez bag
Only multi millionaires who know about that
Be like damn, she doin' it way big
Anything we do we do it B.I.G
Every move we make is always B.I.G
And the number one rule, think B.I.G
And the best rapper's still B.I.G
Anything we do we do it B.I.G
Every move we make is always B.I.G
And the number one rule, think B.I.G
And the best rapper's still B.I.G
Pull out the G fifty five, Chevrolet
Oh by the way I'm doin' it way big
Eight Alpine speakers, custom made H.R.E rims
Uh huh, doin' it way big
The chinchilla blanket, the black diamond anklet
It's made out of rubbergut fagot, try to yank it
Got all glass, Benz in all class
I'm do it big, my first kid gon' have a crib all brass
This is, exotic y'all, I got it y'all
Every color lizard watch from Scotty y'all
Private jets, Tiffany silverware sets
I got shit department stores ain't even get yet
I drop thirty or more in Christian Dior
They gotta close the store and let me shop some more
We go to Broadway plays in six white Rolls Royce
Now that's what you call doin' it way big
Anything we do we do it B.I.G
Every move we make is always B.I.G
And the number one rule, think B.I.G
And the best rapper's still B.I.G
Anything we do we do it B.I.G
Every move we make is always B.I.G
And the number one rule, think B.I.G
And the best rapper's still B.I.G
As long as I'm here, I'm gon' keep doin' it, doin' it how I do it
When I do it best believe I be doin' it way big
We greet our guests at the door
With champagne and cigars that read doin' it way big
Chrome on the doors, stone on the floors
Fourteen karat gold paint on the walls
We swim in pools with marble waterfalls
Ball, baby or don't ball at all
My bathroom is Chanel, my bedroom Louis Vuitton
And office decorated in Ralph Lauren
I got a Versace couch and pillows I sleep on
With the matchin' robe and slippers, I beg to differ
La Perla lingerie, 'cause it fits my body
Get with us, we know how to throw a party
And you can't get in
Without a Queen Bee Members only jacket that reads doin' it way big
Anything we do we do it B.I.G
Every move we make is always B.I.G
And the number one rule, think B.I.G
And the best rapper's still B.I.G
Anything we do we do it B.I.G
Every move we make is always B.I.G
And the number one rule, think B.I.G
And the best rapper's still B.I.G
C'mon dice, one more time now, c'mon dice
And the best rapper's still B.I.G
