In the name of Jesus, let us pray
Father, please walk with us
Through the bad times as well as the good
May we be heard and understood
From the suburbs to the hood
May You judge us by our hearts
And not by our mistakes
And see that we get a breakthrough
However long that it takes
May You fill that void in our souls
That will lay our fears to rest
'Cause there's no way we can live for Jesus
When we're living in the flesh
So I pray that You allow our spirits to be born
Grow strong, move on, know right from wrong
First John, Chapter Two, Verse 15
Do not love the world or anything in the world
And we know what that means but listen
We know the distance
We need to be away from fire to keep it missing
That doesn't mean we'll listen
Lord, You take care of fools and babies
You teach women to honor their men
And men respect their ladies
But lately so many of us have gone astray
Doing wrong for so long that we've forgotten the way
Please bring us back home
Instill in us the word which is our backbone
We're just children that act grown
There is so much that we're entitled to
Yet we receive so little
'Cause in this time of spiritual warfare
We're comfortable in the middle
So I pray that you open our eyes
Give us the anointing to recognize
The Devil and his lies
If we keep our actions wise and our prays sincere
Our heads to the sky, You will diminish our fears
In Jesus' mighty name
We have prayed, Amen and Amen
