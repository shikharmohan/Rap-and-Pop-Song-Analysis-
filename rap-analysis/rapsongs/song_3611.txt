Of course  we have just accepted all applications and tuition will be paid on

You you can't can't be be ripping the mic the mic
like do re me me measels are contagious like my lyrical pages
ripping and flipping the mic
from back in the back in the days the days its kinda hectic hectic
when these suckas don't respect it  check it. Flame on.
I know the light is bright but keep on watching me
I'm stolen property, kicking the flavor to society.
Police be clocking me, but logically they got to be
cause they were taught that serious poetry would come from Socrates.
But that ain't it, in 94 I'll kick the hit
and if I was in front of Shakespear, battle a punk and take his shit.
I'm not having it,
bust a narrative and come to get with it.
Rap is something you do, hip hop is something you live.
The difference is kids nowadays, they got the videos.
Rappers don't need skills to build so they don't really know.
Hear me yo, I'm four times on Arsenio,
got ten videos, but does that help me flow? No.
That's why when I come to the show MC's act like they don't know
cause they were too young to rock up in the disco
Frisco disco the disc is like a Nabisco
chocolate chip cookie, don't fuck with me rookie.
I'm rocking beats and
with death defying feats and
I'm never sneaking
always peeping when I'm speaking
inside I'm keeping a statement for police and
I'm down for peace and but not turn the other cheek and
so this DJ, he gets down
mixing records while they go
round and round round we go
two years ago a friend of mine
and Flash is gonna rock your mind
welcome to the Terrordome, the Terrordome
I wonder if I take you home
E-F-F-E-C-T a cool operator operating correctly
but back in the day I knew rap would never die
too late baby bwai
bai in a body boy head head
head insane in the membrane
take the train, take the train
M-E-T-H-O-D Man
'Hattan keeps on making it
Brooklyn keeps on taking it
We keep coming back with more and more hits
party people, I came through the door, I said it before
Two years ago, super hoe
If my train goes off the track,
pick it up, pick it up, pick it up back back
back to the grill again, the grill again
friends
how many MC's must get dissed?
Before somebody says don't fuck with Chris
Hey! Ho! Keep on moving don't stop no
body beats the Biz
Let's do the dance called the Pee Wee Herman
Hey, Erick Sermon, Hey
you you get off my cloud,
go down baby, go down baby, the gods must be crazy
you ain't fresh, you ain't fresh
Yeah!
