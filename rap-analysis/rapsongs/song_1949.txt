If you love something let it go
If it comes back to you it's yours
If it doesn't, it never was
Hold me down baby
Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway
I'ma live on but I'll be gone any day
Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway
I'ma live on but I'll be gone any day
Hold me down, niggaz wanna know me now
Didn't want ta play wit' me when to show me how
No meow it is all about the bark
Let the dog lose baby it's about to spark
Light up the night like the 4th of July
Niggaz know, when I let go, niggaz die
Wit' this why and you don't know you slow like Baltimore
If you ain't tryin' ta go ya blow
I soak up all the pain and except it in silence
When I let go it's violence 'cause the wildest
Leaves the dog barkin' up the tree for the cat
In the fog but y'all niggaz see is the bat
Flappin' away wit' em blind like Stevy
Niggas don't hear me, still tryin' to see me
Stop being greedy, ya heard what I said?
Let me go, let me flow on my bed
Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway
I'ma live on but I'll be gone any day
Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway
I'ma live on but I'll be gone any day
I sold my soul to the Devil and the price was cheap
A yo it's cold on this level 'cause it's twice as deep
But you don't hear me, ignorance is blissing and so on
Sometimes it's better to be taught dumb, shall I go on
You don't want no real, what the deal is a mystery
How is it I can live and make history?
If you don't see it then it, wasn't meant for you to see
If you wasn't born wit' it then, it wasn't meant for you to be
But you can't blame me for not wantin' to be hound
Lock down in a cell wit' a soul gettin' dwelled
This is hell, go get the devil and get me the key
But can't be worst than the curse that was given ta me
It's what I live for, you take away that and I'm gone
There's a difference between, doin' wrong and being wrong
And that ain't right Just keep it fair baby
Put me in the year, and I'll take it there baby, yes
Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway
I'ma live on but I'll be gone any day
Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway
I'ma live on but I'll be gone any day
I'ma flow regardless because I'm an artist until I'm trapped
I'ma continue to hit the hardest whether I scrap or rap
Give me death but you ain't my friend
I see it in your eyes, you contemplate my end
You waitin' for that bin in the road, where you were told
That you would go, when you were old
And if you died young, it was told
So what the dilly, what it was worth?
Think back 26 years, be like what of his birth
What if it was a miscarriage and I never existed ?
Have I given something that have been taken away
You would've missed it, didn't know, did I persisted?
It was the call of the wild
I'm here to say what's in my heart, and you call it a style
Don't put it in the cage, don't mistreat it
You say you hunger for knowledge, here it is eat it
Another soul completed is another thought captured
Let me do my thing I got it locked wit' this rap shit
Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway
I'ma live on but I'll be gone any day
Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway
I'ma live on but I'll be gone any day
Or give me death or take my breath
I'ma die anyway but I'll be gone any day
Or give me death or take my breath
I'ma die anyway but I'll be gone any day
Where my niggaz?
For my niggaz
For my niggaz
For my niggaz
