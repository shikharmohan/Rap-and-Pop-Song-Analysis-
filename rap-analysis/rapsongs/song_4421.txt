Mo fire, mo fire, yo
Mo fire, weezy, mo fire
Mo fire, I give her, mo fire
Mo fire
Why did he plot, my fifty cup
My city hot, I'm dodgin' the city cop
I play 'em like pitty pat, I'm kickin' back
I'm gettin' stacks, these bitches is really rats
I fuck 'em and give 'em back, I really mack
How real is that, you love him, you really wack
I hustle and bend my back my muscle is in tact
My biceps and triceps is aye yes
Mo fire weezy, mo fire
Mo fire, I give her, mo fire
I come at you, it's somethin' new, the color is smurf blue
I'm puffin' that purple
Believe it if I talk it, I walk like Herhsal
I get it like it is on the commercial
Verse 2, this is verse 2, it is worse too
I'll mirk you like I birth you
You niggas small bubbles, I'll burst you
And spit you out and have your girlfriend slurp you
My jewelry earth blue, some say it's earth green
I'm like whateva my shit mean and obscene
Now I been seen on alotta different scene
That mean I got alotta different creme
Mo fire, weezy, mo fire
Mo fire, I give her, mo fire
I raise mo fire to the man up higher
I lick a shot to let him know that I'm a rider
My dreads hang to let him know that I'm a lion
Represent the jungle when the others just tryin'
I represent my mother like baby stop cryin'
I know my papa gone but guarantee to see her shinin '
Now you are lookin' at New Orleans finest
Now you are being blinded by European diamond
And you were seein' 2 or 3 times
And got your vision all fucked up
Now you can't even find me
And I ain't even hidin' naw, I'm right here baby
She wanna walk witcha, I'm like yea baby
Party man with the shotty to his head
Rock-a-by his ass to sleep, rock it lay him down to bed
I put you in my pocket, right next to the condoms homie
You ain't nuthin' but a prop fish
Mo fire, weezy, mo fire
Mo fire, I give her, mo fire
Mo fire, mo fire, weezy,
Mo fire, mo fire, I giver her
Mo fire, mo fire
