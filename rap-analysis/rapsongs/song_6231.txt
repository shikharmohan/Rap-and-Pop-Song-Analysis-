Mary Jane, ladies and gentlemen
Your host for the night, all choked up
On top of that we got uncle Snoop
And my man Nate Dogg in the Bricks
How do I maintain in this world? A world that's proven meaningful
How do I survive the haters?
How to take the very thing that I work fo'?
Where do I go when I'm hiding? Only I don't know, I just gotta' go by
Yeah, yo Snoop
If I feel in love with another drug, I'd always be broke
Then I'll never have that Purple to smoke, I don't do Coke
Dogg, I rarely drink Pepsi, only Reggie, weed would give you epilepsy
When I talk, dog never indirectly
I'm blunt, you got weed, chumps?
I do about 45 over speed bumps
So when you tryna roll, your weed on the flo'
Joe Piscopo, I play too much
That's why my Saturday night is liver than yours
I'll fight n*** over Mary Jane
Even beat Steven's a*** on Jerry Spring
Ask the Dogg, my weed religion basic
Only nation for the weed is Gold Nation
Now you high, then throw it up
Even Rick James had to sing about her, it's
Ooh, Mary Jane
'Cause I'll be f*** Mary Jane all day
Ooh, Mary Jane
You know what, see I'll be f*** Mary Jane all night
I'm in love with Mary Jane
She's my main thang
Stay away from hocus pocus
That gives me headaches mayne
And when my sack gets low
No, I don't get uptight
I go and find my girl
Once again it's on tonight
One for the money and two for the show
And three for the papers and four for the dro
Here we go, let it flow
Just make sure the end's tight
Take a poof, tell me what it hit like
Paper bag, fill it with the chippers
My new nickname, Mr. Black Jack Tripper
Two b*** and a pad at the same time
And I cracked 'em both wit the same lines
"Do you like to smoke?"
"Can I take your coat?"
"Hennessey with a dash of Coke?"
N*** tryna holla' like "whoopty whoop"
Let the b*** co-ride in Snoopy Coupe
You're rollin' with a m*** winner
And you might win a treat to a TV dinner
We got rules to the game
Nephew, the only b*** I love is Mary Jane
I tell the truth
Ooh, Mary Jane
'Cause I'll be f*** Mary Jane all day
Ooh, Mary Jane
You know what, see I'll be f*** Mary Jane all night
Ooh, Mary Jane
'Cause I'll be f*** Mary Jane all day
Ooh, Mary Jane
You know what, see I'll be f*** Mary Jane all night
Mary Jane
She make you do thangs that a n*** wouldn't normally do, do
Mary Jane
She make a n*** do thangs that I wouldn't normally do, hoo
Ooh, Mary Jane
I'll be f*** Mary Jane all day
And I'll be f*** Mary Jane all night
