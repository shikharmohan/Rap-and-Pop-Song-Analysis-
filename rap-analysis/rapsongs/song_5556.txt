Pray for me, pray for me
Pray for me, pray for me
Pray for me, just pray for me
It's over nigga
Living life with all this thuggness
Destruction, this violence, my projects
I'm a rep to the fullness and you know it
I'm always gon' be infamous
Until the day they lay me down to rest
When I'm in this world, just pray for me
The invicible, infamous Mobb Deep, nigga, fuck you
If you touch one of my dunns, I'll buck you
You ain't got nuts enough to come through
And get back at my niggas for them gun wounds
You a punk bitch ass nigga, you soft duke
I'm a young rich ass nigga who love to
Show you how a nigga get his lights blew
Teach you the mystery God and murk you
Burry you, motherfuckers in the cement
Miss a post of that nigga in the precent
Shoulda known my niggas, don't play with stunts
Shoulda shot back but you got your dome cut
While we party with the pretty little cutties
You'll be fertilizing dirt for new trees
Fucking with the mobbsters out in Q.B
Nigga, you get hung for that shit that your mouth speak
Bitch ass nigga
Just pray for me when I'm out in the world
Just pray for me and if you down for whatever
You'll wait for me, I got these cowards out tryin'
To lay for me and they making me
So just pray for me and I can see it in their eyes
They're afraid of me, homeboy, I ain't the one
You mistaken me while you ratting and snaking me
They making me, so just pray for me
We them niggas that pull them things out
Niggas talk too much, need to shut mouth
A lose lip will sink a niggas ship for real
Then act all suprise when they get killed
Got two fellonies but take a chance still
My life comes first, fuck a record deal
Move that crowd, direct with steel
For a medicine when niggas act ill
The H A V, the O, the C
Be easy on the way that you approach me
Didn't see it coming but he got his plug pulled
That chicks shiesty don't go by what looks good
We in the ear, trust she heard that
Why you loving him, all my niggas tap that
Fake gangstas, I can see right through them
'Cross that line and get your life ruined
Life with all this thuggness
Destruction, this violence, my projects
I'm a rep to the fullness and you know it
I'm always gon' be infamous
Until the day they lay me down to rest
When I'm in this world, just pray for me
Just pray for me when I'm out in the world
Just pray for me and if you down for whatever
You'll wait for me, I got these cowards out tryin'
To lay for me and they making me
So just pray for me and I can see it in their eyes
They're afraid of me, homeboy, I ain't the one
You mistaken me while you ratting and snaking me
They making me, so just pray for me
When I'm out in the world, just pray for me
And if you down for whatever, you'll wait for me
I got these cowards out tryin' to lay for me
They making me, so just pray for me
And I can see it in your eyes, you're afraid of me
Homeboy, I ain't the one you mistaken me
While you ratting and think your snaking me
They're making me, so just pray for me
