Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
It's gettin', it's getting', it's gettin' kinda heavy
Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
It's gettin', it's getting', it's gettin' kinda heavy
Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
It's gettin', it's getting', it's gettin' kinda heavy
It all goes back to '85
When I start gettin' pussy every day of my life
It really didn't matter what the bitch look like
I remember one night after the Sugar Ray fight
Wouldn't you believe it? Dog like a Retriever
I went up in this big fat bitch named Trina
She had a best friend wit titties named Vanessa
She told me to undress her, yes sir
Ain't no pressure, later that semester
She put me down wit her homegirl named Tanisha
She was so vicious, lips so luscious
Suck a nigga dick and have it shinin' like some dishes
Patricia, Patricia, she love da way I stick her
I take her to the movies and now she even bigger
Big bucks, no whammies
I had to meet this white bitch, her name was Tammy
She lived in the Valley, she couldn't understand me
But she let me dig out her homegirl named Brandy
Now Brandy was a cute lil' thick bitch
She moved to the hood from the 206
She brought some new tricks, flippin' them squirrels in the pearls
And turnin' out the neighborhood loose girls
And I seen that, so I beat the yam
So put her down, bottom bitch on my team
And we began makin', breakin' bitches taken
Whatever we won't see, she was upto fakin'
It's real in the field, no mistakin'
And cracked a lil' bitch, yeah, she Jamaican
Time and time again, she would bring me bud
And let me beat it up listenin' to 'One Love'
Off some jerk chicken, I got mo' bitches
Now I'm pumpin' her sister, it's gettin' real suspicious
But the dick is good, so they won't tell
And now their next door neighbor, Clarissa Belle
She been lookin' at me, I think she wanna hit
But I'ma holla back because I'm on another bitch
I'm on some other shit, I got a phone call
From the mothafuckin' President, y'all
He said, "Snoop Dogg, how could I fuck a bitch
And make her suck a dick and not get caught for the fuck of it?"
I told him, "Look, here this is what you do
Make that First Lady sell a lil' pussy for you"
I think he got it 'cause he left fast
He left his daughters and a lotta cash
Well, what do you know? D O double G
Major pimpin' out in D.C.
And I'm a young pimp, got a lotta growin' left
And you'se a young hoe wit a lotta hoein' left
Always keep a hoe in check, blowin' out her train wreck
Yeah, I might have to go adapt
See every little hoe I meet
The stand outs, you know, the ones like Yvette
We fucked in the car, behind the bar
I shot it in her face and it went ahh
My homeboy Charles went up in her sister
Behind the garage
I was nasty, I was freaky, I was sick
When y'all was tryin' to hump, I was teachin' her to suck dick
Always tryin' to go up in a hoe
Got caught tryin' to fuck at school, they asked me what I did it fo'
You know just what I told 'em
I love pussy and this dick is what I showed 'em
And now they threw me out, now I'm at the pad
I'm at a new school, way cool
New hoes, new script, fresh fish
Walk up in the dorm and I bust a new bitch
I'm in some new tail, when I holla back
But for now, let me holla back and holla black
She's a twelfth grader in my Science class
And I done seen her pussy, yeah, boy, movin' fast
See I was taught by and I was called I
Betta move on somethin' fast if I thought I
Could claim a dame or game a brain
Or tame a maim not wit the same old game
See on some different stuff, I'm a different cut
It's what I say and do that make the bitch give it up
Oh, you wanna brag? I wanna brag to
And what you gonna do when they ask you?
Is you gon' tell a lie or you gon' keep it G?
Or you gon' hold it all inside and you gon' tell on me?
Shit, it's all cool 'cause it was all good
It's just another day in Doggy Dogg's neighborhood
You better watch your girl 'cause if she's on the loose
It's a 90 percent chance that she goin' to get pimp juiced
Now what it do, what it is?
Now you livin' wit dat hoe and y'all got 4 kids
Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
It's gettin', it's getting', it's gettin' kinda heavy
Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
It's gettin', it's getting', it's gettin' kinda heavy
Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
It's gettin', it's getting', it's gettin' kinda heavy
