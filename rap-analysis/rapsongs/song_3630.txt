Y'know
There's a difference between dreamin' and visualizin'
Which one are you doin'?
Food gone up, gasoline up
Full time employment passin' me up
Bills pilin' up, really this sucks
I need a couple bucks, really I'm stuck
Here comes a truck, pullin' right up
It says brinks, now I'm thinkin' what's up
But nah, what I'm thinkin' about, yo duck
20, 30, 40 shots at the truck
I'm duckin', runnin', jumpin', lookin' for what?
Some cover for this brother, every thing's nuts
But yo, I can see some others with gats
Brinks firin', they firin' back
Rat, ta tat ta ta tat ta ta tat
Then I woke up
Doctor help me out, what's this all about?
What's this condition I gotta figure out
Am I really out? That I really doubt
Give me the remedy, what is the amount?
Whatever you tellin' me, sellin' me, compellin' me
Yo the light in me ain't out
Anyway I enter, cats remember
Knowledge I sent ya forever they shout
South Bronx, South Bronx
South Bronx, South Bronx
Then I woke up
Well I guess I'm out on my own
With this condition it won't be long
Before for sure my little sanity's gone
I'm livin' off nuttin', losin' my home
Kids in the street, wife alone
I want to sell this very microphone
But then my friend the light was shown
It came through my inner cellular phone
Get up and get out my spirit will shout
Commitment is what love is really about
No down and no out, just up and about
I think I'm gonna take the spiritual route
Then I woke up
Then I realized I'm out of my purpose
Out of my purp', not doin' my work
I went on a search, inside of myself
For true health, love awareness and wealth
I went to the temple and opened my mental
I learned that I'm the cause of all that I been through
Your whole environment is really within you
Reach inside your heart and write a new menu
I'ma be the change that I wanna see
Now I can see that I'm really free
Everything is really always somethin' else
Tell yourself a different story 'bout self
Do you have the courage to be you
All that talk, that you talk, is it really you?
Oh silly you, oh silly me
Your tongue is killin' you, not killin' me
I'm feelin' free to be just what I wanna be
Easily, you see, 'cause I woke up
When I woke up, my debt went down
My locks broke up, my rent went down
My stocks went up, my car sped up
My pockets swell up, my life I found
I'm not so fed up, it's time to get up
A clear mind switched my life around
Now I can see where the help is at
The health, love, awareness and wealth is at
'Cause I woke up
'Cause I woke up, I woke up
When I woke up, I woke up
That's when I woke up
Play that back
