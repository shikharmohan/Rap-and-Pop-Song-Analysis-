[Doe - Verse 2]
This is a discipline rap for my niggaz back in tha bin
Tryin to hustle for the tin
A discipline tracks for my niggaz that rap
But now im back and i hope ya dont do that ...
Soul is the heart of it i hope i can get every lil bit of it
But sometimes ya gotta slow it down
Like the few Mc's that do shows in my town
Back in 2000 the rap game was lackin
Like some of them rappers bringin two steps back in
But today is the day for hunger in the game
It aint bout the fame its all about the brains
And if you got that and yo rhymes are phat
Gone on head and do that
But ya always gotta think ...
Ohh u thought i stopped rappin
Put yo money back in the bank on my rank im numba 1
You is numba 2 i dont know what cha gone do
Ya gotta think it threw but too all my Mc's
Back in the game this shit it like it was back in the day
Im bout to thorw the fist all my hoes do ya head like this {ohh}
[Chorus - E-40]
Do ya head like this, do ya head like this
Do ya head like this, do ya head like this
Do ya head like this, do ya head like this
Now gas break dip dip, gas break dip dip
Do ya head like this, do ya head like this
Do ya head like this, do ya head like this
Do ya head like this, do ya head like this
