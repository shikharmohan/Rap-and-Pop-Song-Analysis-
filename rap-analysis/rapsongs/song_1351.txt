Hard times in the funk
Yeah, so funkdafied
So let's take a ride with the Brat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat on that ass
So, so, so funkdafied
So, so, so funkdafied
Open up, open up and let the funk flow in
From this nigga named J and his new found friend
I'm hittin' switches like Eric on the solo creep
For yo jeep it's the B R A T
Puttin' the dip in your hip from right to left
It's that ghetto west bitch and I'm so, so Def
Nigga, that's my click, nigga, that's who I rolls with
And we kicks nothing but the fat shit
Them calls me the funkdafied, funkalistic, vocalistic
With the real shit, we got the shit you can't fuck wit
(Why?)
Because we so funkdafied
(Why?)
We make you move from side to side
Well, it's the G H the E T T O, nigga
Brat and J.D. comin' like that big baby
So lay back and listen as I catch up on my pimpin'
And freak this duet just like Ashford and Simpson
'Cause I'm so, so, so funkdafied
So, so, so funkdafied
So, so, so funkdafied
So, so, so funkdafied
Puttin' it down, puttin' it down, ain't no thing to me
And ain't too many hoes that can hang with me
It's like that and as a matter of fact, when it comes to the Brat
I got the shit that'll make your neck snap back
Meaning I got the shit that a get'cha bent
Tearin' the roof off this motha like Parliament
I'm on a roll in control like Janet, damnit!
(Ranch, oh, the funk bandit and they can't handle it)
I know, that's why I keep hittin' 'em with this grammar
Lettin' niggas know that I'm the real mama jama
Straight to the head like a chronic sack
I passed the mic to the Brat and yo I passed it back
Wella sistas and fellas, it's time to get your groove on
I provide the funkdafied sound to make you move on
Breakin' these fools off proper like
It's S O S O D E F  dynamite
Hummin-ah, hummin-ah, comin' up at ya like Ralph K
And since this ain't no honeymoon, I'm here to stay
And the way we comin' at ya, baby, we can't miss
There's a new tag team in town, nigga, whoomp, there it is
So, so, so funkdafied
So, so, so funkdafied
So, so, so funkdafied
So, so, so funkdafied
