Mr. M.O.E. the boss baby 
Was a southside living legend of 3rd ward 
And it all started a 9-3 
Highschool he was a fool he was only 18 
With the dreams of becoming a ghetto superstar 
Rollin in foreign cars through the streets of 3rd ward 
It was all momma leave em with a trace of Mo E 
And promethyzein and he a codeine fiend 
And his team was the coldest everyday they rolled big 
Niggas and hoes dont dig 'cause thats a screwed up click

Cuz I don't wanna fall asleep 
So just pour it in my drink and ima sip until I lean hard 
Drink got me moving slower than a retard 
So press record and hear these hot raps 
Im in the booth cup on me like a jock-strap 
And I will not nap until the bottles empty 
Then I pour a little more for past Screw and Pimp C 
And I would stop but believe it I cant 
So till Short is gone its just me and my drink
