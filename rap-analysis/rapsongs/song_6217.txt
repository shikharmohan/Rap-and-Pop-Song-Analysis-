Yo, now first of all I'm a kid about money
Talkin' hot business and my paper work, runnin
Doc an' hot nick's like good will hunting
Put them shotguns up in the air and start, pumpin'
Real niggaz in the hood don't start, nuttin'
When the heat breaks they proceed to start, dumpin'
You eyeballin' me like you movin' somethin'
Yo' bitch fuckin' you with me in the walkman
Slow down boy, you're not a real, killer
Three-wheel motion from me shootin' the wheel up
Out the jungle, doc straight gorilla
Bananas, antennas can't pick up
My crew is triple P, watch us do it
Brook-nam, Shaolin, the T-dot, Newark
All my shorties skippin' school watch truant
Hit the college dorm, make freaks out the students
Yeah, now do you like the way it feel baby?
(Uh huh)
Do you like the way the bricks move baby?
(Uh huh)
Roll the l, let's inhale baby
(Uh huh)
Startin' it up before twelve baby
(Uh huh, uh huh)
To my niggaz that say fuck hoes
(Uh huh)
Only real dog is they red nose
(Uh huh)
If it ain't green can't accept those
(Uh huh)
That can't roll with niggaz that's petrol
(Uh huh)
Niggaz, abandon ship when I'm geared for landing
Your own tec'll see my grill and start, jamming
Throw your hands up in the air, keep 'em standin'
Fuck if you in here on I E, laminates, fuck you
You'll get touched too with the, cannon
Around the handle, a fuck you Bandanna
Dawg I was grown with balls and bad, manners
That's why me and your broad is on, camera
I'm sick from a childhood head, blow
When systems was pumpin' before I let, go
The head honcho fall back and pump, fo'
Bigger four flows 'til they scream, all go
Now wake your punk-ass up if you asleep
Doc and brick city bout fo'-thousand deep
Fourteen years old, got TV's in the, seat
Watchin' pornos of Janet, Jack and me
Yeah, now do you like the way it feel baby?
(Uh huh)
Do you like the way the bricks move baby?
(Uh huh)
Roll the l, let's inhale baby
(Uh huh)
Startin' it up before twelve baby
(Uh huh, uh huh)
To my niggaz that say fuck hoes
(Uh huh)
Only real dog is they red nose
(Uh huh)
If it ain't green can't accept those
(Uh huh)
That can't roll with niggaz that's petrol
(Uh huh)
