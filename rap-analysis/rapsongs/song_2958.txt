As I begin fall in, I spark da riot, no longer quiet
I got a voice that's in ya ear, stand clear
It's madness everywhere I look but can't see so much
I can't explain how I feel on da real
Everyday is like a ferris, looking to find some wheels
Homey after homey dying over humbug
Keeping my mind immune to pain
I'm going insane just thinking about the past
At last, it's a future I can see much more that I got older
So I know how the game goes telling me like I can't cope
It's the dope you smoke that's why you looking at me ready to jack
'Cause that crack got your back broke
Have to learn the hard way out the hood, thank it's real
When it's flaw I saw this nigga get shot in front of my school
It wasn't cool, that gangsta shit affects not poppin' off
Just da 'jects 360 degrees all due with respect
It's da comin' of da killin' tool click
Atlanta's got a killin' tool
Watch me rule bitch, killin' tool click
Watch the killin' tool, watch the killin' tool click
Waa-tah, tha angelical Ninja when ya blink
You'll need a shrink, how da fuck did you think
Dat I could be sniped nigga? See you fuckin' right
I'm mo' try to kill ya, straight drill ya
I take my fuckin life serious
You attack my self defense is war period
I know niggas all over the Swats
Niggaz that'll get in yo' ass on the spot
Concoct like a wise wizard just 'cause I wear tha red eye
You may think I'm a high nigga
But looks could be deceiving
God lives within me and brother I feel Him
I speak to God before I take my gat and juice ya
'Cause He tha one that's holding my future
See as you learn me you journey out of time
'Cause your present state I gotta take ya out ya mind
Y'all done let tha devil tear your perfect world up
Got men sleepin' wit men and girls wit girls
Seems all right to you, hey but to me that's taboo, yes I do
Fuck that dumb shit, I comes wit, drums hit
Some get tha hummin', comin' from tha witch doctor's gunin'
Killin' tool click, come with the killin' tool click
[Incomprehensible] with soap sent you home
With yo' shit pokin' out, the loft shoutin' out obscenities
No it's just a dream but I'm a sore loser
Figg murderer, crosses burnin' in my front yard
KKK throwin' up rallies but not no more in these parts
Trespassers gets penalized, 2:13 A.M.
Basic nine channel surfin', this one eyed monster
Servin' it's purpose, Clampett's biggest hustle 1999
Three dollars plus shippin' an' handlin'
Major credit card holders accepted but I'm a minority
Septic tank on ABC
Turner broadcasting niggas done already took over this bitch
System just still runnin' to be or not to be
Done in at the push of a button
Is the question, I think they got this bitch rigged to blow up in my face
Duddy the first African American to walk in space
Now who you think had the pleasure of tryin' on they new suit
The nightmare continues, are we just penny gig's?
Comin' of da killin' tool click, come back to rule bitch
Comin' of da killin' tool click, killin' tool click, killin' tool click
Atlanta's got a killin' tool click, come back to rule bitch
Comin' of da killin' tool click, tool click, tool click
East Point, on the concrete is where I make my money at
On this concrete is where I make my livin' at
On this concrete is where your blood can flow
On this concrete, fool if I don't get tha dough
I'm pumpin' thangs out of suite 116
Got the Arab sewed up, stitched up, buckle up, buckle down
Hit the sto' 7-Tre-1 as soon as I exit 166, traffic gettin' stuck
But fuck this, I hit tha back streets, ended up coming down Childress
Ain't no space cut through the Fina, so I park, I hit my usual
I fuck and hold, flip and fold, no life insurance
But I got my Grady card depress me, stress me
Tha same that exploit me suppress me
Break Cam, run thinkin' of a son trying to see through tha fog
Just to see how far who's coming out the woods
And I suggest you don't fuck wit us, cracker, you stuck wit us
And you know how long we been waiting for you
Devil, We know what you been contemplating to do
We have been here before but surprise again
It is time for niggas to uprise again
But we've been down for so long that you wondering how
It ain't a weapon that you got that can stop me now
Because we don't die, we won't die
And won't never get no better if we don't try
But don't get scared niggas get prepared, I gotta care
'Cause them fuckin' devils never cared so come and find us
Get behind us, if you ain't hear the message clear then rewind us
'Cause we comin', we comin', we comin', comin', comin', yeah
Comin' of da killin' tool click, come back to prove it
Atlanta's got a killin' tool click, watch da tool click
Atlanta's got a killin' tool click, these boys got a killin' tool click
Killin' tool click, killin' tool click
Southwest Atlanta, Southwest
I suggest you don't mess with Southwest
I suggest you don't mess with Southwest
I suggest you don't mess with Southwest
[Incomprehensible]
Killin' tool click, killin' tool click, killin' tool click
