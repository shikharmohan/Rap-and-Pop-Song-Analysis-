Don't make me wait
Don't make me wait
Don't make me wait
Give me body
Give me body
Welcome into my queendom, come one come all
When it comes to lyrics I bring them
In spring I sing in fall I call out to all the ones who had a hard day
I prepared a place on my dance floor
The time is now for you to party
I thought it would be a good chance for you to move
One nation under a groove
House music always soothes
So get with the flow let's go yo
Can you rock to a house groove tempo?
If so, then shall we let the games begin?
What better off position can you be in?
I'm on fire, the flame's too hot to douse
The pool is over, come into my house
Don't make me wait
Come into my house
Give me body
Don't make me wait
Come into my house
Give me body
Here's a dance step, from now I'll kick a
Bass and treble flow through the speakers
Ride the rhythm, I know it's gonna reach ya
I'm the queen, Latifah
Now it's time to run through it 45 king? Cue it
Yeah, there you go, I told you you could do it
Now did you enjoy it?
That was cool
I knew it
Dance to the beat of the drum, give me some
With the flavor unit I've come to say, "Ride the groove line"
Don't swing the pipeline, listen to the smooth line
Throw away the white line
It's a house party I'm hosting
Come and rock with the one who's chosen
It can't turn me inside out
For those who dare, to come into my house
Don't make me wait
Come into my house
Give me body
Don't make me wait
Come into my house
Give me body
It's a new fusion I'm using, you ask what is it I'm doing?
Hip hop house, hip hop jazz, with a little pizazz
From the queen, the queen of royal badness
Remember me from wrath of my madness?
It's my rap that rocks this party, I'm a hijack and jack your body
This is not an erotic interlude, keep in mind I move multitudes
The Asiatic black woman, hardcore beat drumming
It's hard to keep a good woman down, so I keep coming
Blow for blow, I take and I get some still I rise in a civilized wisdom
I hope the lyrical display has you around
It's an open invitation, come into my house
Don't make me wait
Come into my house
Give me body
Don't make me wait
Come into my house
I want you to give me body
Don't make me wait
Come into my house
I know you're there, give me body
Don't make me wait
Come into my house
All the ones on the dance floor give me body
Yeah, come on, yeah
Come on, yeah
Give me body
Give me body
Give me body
Give me body
Come on, come on
Give me body
I know you're out there
I want you to come over here
To do a little somethin' like this
Shake it up then
Give me body
Don't make me wait
Don't make me wait
Don't make me wait
