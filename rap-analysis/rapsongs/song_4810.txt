James Todd Smith, know what I'm sayin'? Track masters
Fresh off the private jet from Europe did four months out there
Extra paper, scoop that up
Back on the scene, crisp and clean
You know how we get down baby?
Let me tell you a lil' story
You're not a chicken head goin' hee-shey
You're choosy in the bed like hee-shey
I know your man's in the feds but hee-shey
I can't figure out the reason you keep hawkin' me
Is it the invisible settings on the baguettes?
The Benzes, Beamers and Corvettes?
Or the wood-grain in the convertible Lex
Be ease, shoppin' sprees, what designer is next?
Is it the Diablo, parked on Rodeo?
Half a mill' in the trunk and I ain't moved no llello
Could it be I'm anti-pimp, hundred-thousand a clip
Hat low, doin' donuts when I pull up out the dealership
Is it the the Fortune 500 covers?
The family man that got one baby mother?
The way I brainwash y'all to love one another
And got the whole community bouncin' in unity
Born to love you baby
Why?
You know I love you baby
Why?
Kiss and hug you baby
Why?
I'll always love you baby
Why?
Born to love you baby
Why?
You know I love you baby
Why?
Kiss and hug you baby
Why?
I'll always love you baby
Hmm you're not a chicken head goin' hee-shey
You're choosy in the bed like hee-shey
I know your man's in the feds but hee-shey
I can't figure out the reason you be hawkin' me
Is it the twenty million I be grabbin' a flick?
Or my 400 million dollar FUBU clique?
Is it the in the house syndication chips
Poppin' two bottles, shorty read my lips
They say ladies, love, legend in leather
Simple ain't it uh, but quite clever
Is it the fact I melt in liquid ice?
Tapped it once, you felt it twice
Is it the multiple O's I'm known for those
Temptation Island, wildin' 'cause my neck froze
Is it the bowlegged, hard-headed
Little honey in my grill with her pinkies whetted?
Forget it
Born to love you baby
Why?
You know I love you baby
Why?
Kiss and hug you baby
Why?
I'll always love you baby
Why?
Born to love you baby
Why?
You know I love you baby
Why?
Kiss and hug you baby
Why?
I'll always love you baby
Mmm you're not a chicken head goin' hee-shey
You're choosy in the bed like hee-shey
I know your man's in the feds but hee-shey
I can't figure out the reason you keep hawkin' me
Is it the way I caress and hold you close?
The iller, villa in Barbados?
Is it the Countache rollin' up to your door? Yeah
Tell your roommate you ain't dancin' no more, yeah
Tell 'em your new man is cooler than before, yeah
Tell 'em bout them twenty thousand on tour, yeah
Is it the the way that I defend your honor?
Backhand your ex-man, tell him kill the drama?
Is it the way the Mazerrati hug her body
Make you wanna be my next hottie
From the bottom to the bottom to the top to the top
Cruise it don't stop
Born to love you baby
Why?
You know I love you baby
Why?
Kiss and hug you baby
Why?
I'll always love you baby
Why?
Born to love you baby
Why?
You know I love you baby

Why?
I'll always love you baby
Born to love you baby
You know I love you baby
Kiss and hug you baby
I'll always love you baby
