Juelz verse 1:   
Im Feeling like a 
black republican 
nah i cant call it 
more like a black democrat 
runnin them out of office 
young Barack Obama im all for it 
the rock of Gibraltar is now fallin on ya 
i protect my land like a farmer 
pockets stay chubby like toccara
or should i say fat like the parkers 
tote big guns like im still playin contra 
ya'll washed up like money thats laundered 
yall funny im bonkers honest 
girl strapped to my dick like a harness
rockstar flyer then an ostrich 
and i cover east,west,north,south like a compass 
i shall shine forever never tarnish 
money buried behind my house like a garden 
all green my bank accounts like a forest
i cant feel my face is gettin started and weezy is my accomplice (yea) a black activist like sonny carson 
stripes of a sargent salute me
and chicks i get'em high higher then turbulences 
white Phantom lookin so fergalicious 
im from the city of big drugs and murder victims 
its get rich go to jail or be a murder victim (AY!)
now all yall listen if you cant take the heat get out the kitchen
lil wayne verse 2:
I'm  Feelin like a 
Black Republican 
Tote a mac in da public and
act so southern 
die for my brotheren
money
money money like Money Mack and Publishing
One life to live never ask for a mulligan
Streets cold but the heat make ya feel covered and
been had cake day late like Ed Sullivan
Fly like a eagle but no,
I'm not Donovan
Boy ya better go eat some soup wit your mom and dem
And my mind is on anotha continent
I am real Cash Money no counterfeit
I don't parking lot pimp 
I just politic
But I get all in her mouth like Polident
New Orleans' Representa to the enda
Come from the city where the glitta don't glimma
the sun don't shine
and the gunz don't sleep
wake a nigga ass up like he got somewhere to be!
