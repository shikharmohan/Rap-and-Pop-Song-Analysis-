What you mean I don't need you no more?
'Cause I don't
I gotta bag full of toys
And I don't need none of your boys
So you can hit every chick on the block
'Cause I'm gone be alright
Once I turn this power on, you dig?
Toys!
You don't get the job done
When I need a little loving
So I gotta do it myself if I wanna feel something
So I grab me a toy, lil' boo ain't buggin'
But now I want some affection
And you ain't giving me nothing
A toy, every girl must have a toy
The way it make you feel
Every girl has a toy now, baby
A toy, every girl must have a toy
The way it make you feel, c'mon
I keep my butterfly close
When you don't wanna be bothered
Don't come waking me up
'Cause I ain't giving you nada
'Cause I got me a toy, toy
And it works for me and it lasts longer than the battery
So you best believe that
A toy, every girl must have a toy
The way it make you feel
Every girl must have a toy
A toy, every girl must have a toy
The way it make you feel
I used to wish that you would love me
And fantasize on how we, we used to be
Until I discovered something better than you
I don't need, no need, need your loving
You wanna come home late at night
Touchin' and feelin' all over me
But I don't need no help in pleasing me
A toy, every girl must have a toy
The way it make you feel
Every girl must have a toy
A toy, every girl must have a toy
The way it make you feel, c'mon, c'mon
How could I miss you baby I didn't even know you was gone
It's obvious you aren't needed in the bedroom anymore
I'm just keeping myself occupied like all women do
When they are taking a bath and when you leave
Make sure you don't slam the door because
You fuck up my concentration
Toy!
