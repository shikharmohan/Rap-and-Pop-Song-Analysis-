Watch what you say to me
You better watch what you say to me
Watch what you say to me
You say, I spray, hey
Watch what you say to me
You see me, you know I'm two'd up
You don't wanna see me cut the full grip
Well, watch what you say to me
Let me find out you talkin' tough in your song
When you see me you know what's up, boy, it's on
Nigga, what you say to me
You see 'cause I ain't been a fuck, nigga, never
I'm just warnin' all you, sucka niggas
Better watch what you say to me
'Cuz I'm known to make a mountain outta molehill
You don't want to get your folk killed
Well, watch what you say to me
Got a tool in my pocket and the club just rock
Watchin' these niggas while your girlfriend jockin'
They better let it go because niggas already know
That I got that thang with me and it ain't just to let it go
I'm tryin' to mind my [Incomprehensible] till I hit it, niggas, say yo
They ain't nobody fuck 'em, I'm thinkin I'm finna bust 'em, wait
Look up and see the police is lookin' at me
I tell C, he tell Doug, they tell KT
We proceed to surround 'em and call the [Incomprehensible]
Pick the perfect spot to make sure that the girls see
Was watchin' off for doin' the drink, he say what? What you think
Then he call, from then on you can see nothin' but bottles
Remy Martin to the noggin, better bust it wide open
Ya bitch standin' here hollerin' while you lyin' on the floor, shit
Why you feelin' sorry for him? He asked for it
Listen, ya'll, here come the moral of the story
Watch what you say to me
You see me, you know I'm two'd up
You don't wanna see me cut the full grip
Well, watch what you say to me
Let me find out you talkin' tough in your song
When you see me you know what's up, boy, it's on
Nigga, what you say to me
You see 'cause I ain't been a fuck, nigga, never
I'm just warnin' all you, sucka niggas
Better watch what you say to me
'Cuz I'm known to make a mountain outta molehill
You don't want to get your folk killed
Well, watch what you say to me
Rap music is sudden ain't it, the way these pictures is painted
You swear these niggas is dangerous, the gangsta shit they be sayin'
Lock 'em up in the booth with a half a ounce of that Cannibus
Sittin' back and watch the Outlandish shit they betrayin' but
Soon as you see 'em they freeze up like in museums
Them statues you like, is that the dude who said he was gonna pop?
Niggas, get runnin' before you finish your sentence
And then they back to riffin' when they off in a safe distance
You, like you was just here, you disappeared like magicians in thin air
I'm like damn, nigga, at least keep it consistent
I hear you debatin' me lately, I've been doin' my best to stay hater free
Still watch what you say to me
Sooner or later I'll take you up on your offer
And put you all in your place like I'm replacing your father
You talkin' to the author, the architect of the blueprint
My DNA in your music, mothafucker, are you stupid?
Watch what you say to me
You see me, you know I'm two'd up
You don't wanna see me cut the full grip
Well, watch what you say to me
Let me find out you talkin' tough in your song
When you see me you know what's up, boy, it's on
Nigga, what you say to me
You see 'cause I ain't been a fuck, nigga, never
I'm just warnin' all you, sucka niggas
Better watch what you say to me
'Cuz I'm known to make a mountain outta molehill
You don't want to get your folk killed
Well, watch what you say to me
'Cuz I ain't never been a sucka, been gangsta my whole life
So a nigga disrespect me and it's on on sight
I hear what you say in your songs, some of it I don't like
Heat it up, I feel tried, I see you, we gon' fight
Be a man, say my name if you talkin' to me
You never said, well, I figured you ain't talkin' to me
Find out you is at the awards, well, I'll call you out in the street
I swear I'll beat your fuckin' ass like it ought to be beat
See all that whisperin' is lame, I ain't one for the game
If I say, fuck you then it's fuck you, nigga, simple and plain
I say, no problem, it's no problem, pimp then you do the same
Now you can just swallow your pride 'cuz you know I'm off the chain
Try to refrain from bein' violent but you come out your face
I got my lawyer paid already to catch me a case
When I feel you disrespected me I'ma get me a case
But all this shit can be avoided one way
Watch what you say to me
You see me, you know I'm two'd up
You don't wanna see me cut the full grip
Well, watch what you say to me
Let me find out you talkin' tough in your song
When you see me you know what's up, boy, it's on
Nigga, what you say to me
You see 'cause I ain't been a fuck, nigga, never
I'm just warnin' all you, sucka niggas
Better watch what you say to me
'Cuz I'm known to make a mountain outta molehill
You don't want to get your folk killed
Well, watch what you say to me
