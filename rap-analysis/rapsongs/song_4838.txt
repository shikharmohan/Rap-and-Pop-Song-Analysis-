[Young Jeezy:]
On 285, I don't know where I'm goin on 285, I drink when I drive
I just love when I'm high, I don't know here I'm goin, on 285, on 285, on 285 [x2]
[Ludacris:]
I come equipped with 2 straps on my lap move back 45 tucked by my side
Sip a little bit of this, sip that drink up I'm so drunk when I drive.
I'm wood grain, grippin n tippin on some 24's.
I puff the magic dragon & then blow smoke out of my nose
I try to tell em ain't nuttin change by the mileage on the range
It's baby powder white n I whip it like cocaine
All up n down 285 n I'm goin around in circles mann
My partners call me prince cause they know I got that purple rain
Burners along my waist belt, gotta put up my pants like I'm urkel man
My girlfriends says u sure I said bitch I'm for certain man
I'm hurtin the game so bad they can't keep up when I'm counting this? scrilla?
My momma quit her job cause I got her workin with six figures
Yes shes workin with six figures n niggas is workin like some slaves
She retired a little bit early because her son is fukin paid
And she ain't gotta do shit but be rich n stay alive
And once an awhile just take her Lexus n drive on 285
