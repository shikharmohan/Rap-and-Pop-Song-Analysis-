Comp-ton [5x]
Ah, Real Muthaphukkin G'z [4x]
Hey yo Dr. here's another proper track and it's phat
Watch the sniper, time to pay the piper
And let the real shit provoke
See you's a wanna be loc and you get smoked and I hope that your
Fans understand when you talk about preyin' me
The same records that your makin' is payin' me
Muthafuck Dre, Muthafuck Snoop, Muthafuck Death Row
Yo and here comes my left blow
'Cause I'm the E-A-Z-Y-E and this is the season
To let the real Muthaphuckkin G's in
You're like a kid you find the poop when you open up your diaper
But tell me where the fuck you find that anorexic rapper
Talkin' about who you go squabble with and who you shoot
You're only 60 pounds when you're wet and wearin' boots
[Gangsta Dresta]
Damn E they tried to fade you on Dre Day
But Dre Day only make Eazy's payday
All of a sudden Dr. Dre is a G-Thang
But on his old album covers he was a she thang.
So nigga please, nigga please, don't step to these
Muthaphuckkin Real G's
[Gangsta Dresta]
Every day it's a new rapper
Claimin' to be deffer than the Dresta
Smoother than a bitch, but betray the role of gangster
Ain't broke a law in your life, yet every time you rap you yap about the guns and knives, just take a good look at the Nigga
And you'll capture the fact that 
the bastard is simply just an actor
Who mastered the bang and the slang and the mental
Of niggas in Compton, Watts, and South Central
Never ever once have ya ran with the turf
But yet in every verse claim ya used to do the dirt
But tell me who's a witness to ya fuckin' work
See ya never had no business so save the drama, jerk
Niggas straight kill me knowin' that they pranksters
This is goin' out to you studio gangsters
See I did dirt but put in work and many niggas can vouch that
So since I've got stripes I got the right to rap about that
But niggas like you, I gotta hate ya
Cause I'm just tired of so many niggas
Claiming that they come from projects
Knowin' you ain't seen no parts of the streets G
Think ya started trying to bang a rap
While ya tryin' to sign a peace treaty
Wearing khakis and mime while you rhyme
Little fag try to sag, but ya floodin' at the same time
And ya set don't accept ya, Scared to kick it with your homies
Cause ya know they don't respect ya
So nigga please check nuts before you step to these
Muthaphuckkin Real G'z
[B.G. Knocc Out]
Well, It's the Knock out, definition original baby gangsta 
approach me like you hard muthafucka 
I'm a bank ya, shank ya with my fuckin' shank if I hafta
Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg are fuckin' actors
Pranksters, studio gangsters, busters
but this time you're dealing with some real muthafuckas
jeez, nigga please, don't try to step cause if you do
Then a peeled cap is all that would be left
See young niggas like me will break you of something
Claiming my city but Dre you ain't from Compton
Niggas like ya'll is what I call wannabes
And ain't shit compared to Real Muthaphuckkin G's
[Eazy-E]
I never met an OG who never did shit wrong
Ya tried to diss the Eazy-E so now nigga it's on
You and your Doggy Dogg think that you're hogging shit
Both of you bitches can come and suck my doggy dick
Beatin' up a bitch don't make you shit
But then again some niggas think it makes a man. . . Damn
It's a trip how a nigga could switch so quick
From wearing lipstick to smoking on chronic at picnics
And now ya think your bigger, but to me you ain't nothin'
but a bitch ass nigga
That ain't worth a food stamp
And at Death Row I hear you're getting treated like boot camp
Gotta follow your sergeant's directions
Or get your ass popped with the Smith & Wesson
Learn a lesson from the Eaze
Stay in your place and don't step to REAL MUTHAPHUCKKIN G'Z
Boy you should've know by now 
Eazy duz it
