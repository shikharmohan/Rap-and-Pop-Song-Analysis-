We brought some real women and she all in they way
(VERSE1)
Ay come and get yo girl, I don't want ah
Solicitin that pussy like she standin on a corner
Her breath smell like Corona, and Patron, and marijuana
She givin me her numba I ain't gonna telephone ah
Shawty listen come and get yo girl, cause she trippin
Pissy drunk and she won't listen when I tell ah get to gettin
Did you hea me, cause you sittin there still while we chillin
And you illin actin silly like you too high on a pill
And I'm feelin like if that's yo girl you should get ah
Me and my partnas are not goin to be bothered with ah
Listen nigga come and get yo girl out my section

Get yo girl, she all in my space
Backin her ass up all in my face
Come and get yo girl, cause shawty wont leave
How can she be yours when she all up on me
Come and get yo girl, cause shawty so uuuugh
Lookin like trash i aint sayin nuttin to er
Come and get yo girl, ay shawty cant stay
We brought some real women and she all in they way
(VERSE2)
Ay shawty really come and get cho chick
She on me like the horses on my polo
In hea tryna get a photo
Please come do somethin wit cho hoe
I'd rather leave solo, cause she aint even so-so
What tha fuck she got on, them ain't LV's on her logo
Bitches wit me got the green light, she mo like a no-go
She couldnt ride wit me in my two seater or my fo'-do'
She aimin at the star tryna holla at a nigga
What tha fuck she thinkin bout, I got elevated figure
Man it took a cuz nigga, money in the bank
Blowin Black and Mild smoke, ha breath so stank
I came in tha club swagg sharper than a shank
And she throwin ass at me, head bigger than a tank
(Chorus)
Come and get yo girl, she all in my space
Backin her ass up all in my face
Come and get yo girl, cause shawty wont leave
How can she be yours when she all up on me
Come and get yo girl, cause shawty so uuuugh
Lookin like trash i aint sayin nuttin to er
Come and get yo girl, ay shawty cant stay
We brought some real women and she all in they way
