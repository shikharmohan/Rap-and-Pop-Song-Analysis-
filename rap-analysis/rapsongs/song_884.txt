It be so funny to see how badly they want it
The fall, fuckin' up somethin' me and my niggas is ready to brawl
Now I'm ready to call my niggas get off of the wall
I run up in the club like how these bitches will run in the mall
While we poppin' the collar holla you need to folla the scholar
Hustle for dollas and rock it until manna
My niggas, know how we do it
I do it for the love and the riches, my niggas hittin' them switches

Put this shit back in order and keep in mind

You still be lovin' the way we put it on y'all
Oh baby, I know you know I really mean well
Mizzy givin' me head all up inside of my V-12
Female bitches throwin' they pussy at retail
All up in ya face seein' every intricate detail
Now we rollin' wit bigger money we foldin'
Crackin' more in the safe in money we holdin'
Hold on, pause, these bitches be droppin' they drawers
Layin' flat on they stomach and poppin' it all on the floor
Comin' to get us, we tossin' ya niggaz like lettuce
Leavin' you beat up regrettin' the moment you met us
Bitches open for bonin' and fuckin' they starvin' the let us

Or you wlyin' up in the club or you throwin' the bottle
