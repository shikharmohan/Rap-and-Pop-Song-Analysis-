My nigga just entered your business, so can I get a witness?
Can you duck? Fuck the po-po, pow
Startin' to kick this, gonna get my shit, and then you fucked up
Me buck, me bang, niggas ain't talkin' 'bout them thangs
Thugs remain, hang, swang with a click tight claim
Come again, now they drop down when I'm off the block
Fuck them cops, me and Krayzie runnin' through the Boneyard, daily
Gotta give 'em up to the glock-glock
So I can serve me thugs and maintain to the brain
And thugs remain to slang thangs, long live the dope game
And it won't end ya as long as my niggas remember
No pretender, get right up off the Clair, nigga, fuck it, no surrender
No surrender
No surrender
Not wantin' the copper to hit me a lick up
Found me a victim to stick up, pick up, rollin' the nine-ball, slippin'
That's why me trippin', bloody victim, get him when the time calls, dog
Take two-eleven, bailin', thuggin', knowin' these niggas well
Then Bone's fuckin' with the hoes, here comes them po-pos
Nigga, that pig done peeped me, me gots to flees and get my creep on
Bone get gone, hit a wrong turn, mash the gas, and dash on
Jump outta the hottie, move me body
Hittin' them cuts and trails, runnin' like
We lunatics gotta make it back to Hazel daily
Escape and eludin' the chase, buckin' me gauge
So nigga, remember me killa, me no surrender
Me killa, me killa, me killa
No surrender
No surrender
Puttin' me on my knees, tellin' me move and I'm dead
'Cause I'm killin' all your bitches, turnin' them blue suits red
And then I'm comin' to that funeral to shoot that bitch up
Because I know that's where ya'll bitches is bound to meet up
Cop killas, all up in they chest and I know what to do with that vest, man
Twenty-two shots, I killa, you don't wanna fuck with Bone, nigga
And it really ain't shit to pull a trigger on a copper
'Cause if I go down, some of ya'll goin' down
'Cause I'm goin' down poppin', so motherfuck all coppers
Let me catch you slippin', nigga, bet I pop ya
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop
Ya better believe it's Judgement Day
So, nigga, just throw your pumps up in the air
Now kill 'em, kill 'em copper, like ya just don't care
When they come, they come creepin', me peepin'
Gotta watch them po-pos sleepin', put 'em in deep in gutters
Me keepin' 'til a me rich and gotta get mine, every time
This'll be over in nine nine, so nigga, get down for the crime
Gonna be more coppers dyin' in the line, fuckin' with thugs
When I be slangin' my drugs, tryin' to cuff me and my nigga boy
Gotta rip them guts and lay your head in blood
Better check yourself next time you test and try to smoke a nigga.
Bitch, remember, me killa, me no surrender
Me no surrender, nigga, me no surrender
Me no surrender, don't make me put one in ya
Me no surrender, don't make me put one in ya
Me no surrender
No surrender
No surrender
No surrender
