And we can do what u really want 
Girl we grown 
And if he ain't gon treat u right 
Then I ain't gon treat u wrong 
That's my word 
And she heard so many lies 
She don't kno what's true or not 
Shawty like a valet service I swear she been through alot 
But I put her car in park and never let her cry alone 
I listen to her heart beat because it plays my favorite song 
I can hear your heart crying out for me (crying out for me) 
I can hear your heart crying out for me 
(And it keeps on saying) 
Come on in, come on in come on in and save me  
(And it keeps on saying) 
Come on in, come on in come on in and save me 
(I can baby) I can hear your heart crying out for me 
Baby, I should've never caught no feelings 
But baby having late night conversion on your sofa 
You telling me how he played you out over and over, over and over 
But I'm stuck in the middle of seeing you hurt 
I know when you love him 
And you wanna make it work 
And I can't help but think that I knew you first 
It's getting louder 
Girl I can't ignore it no more baby 
I can hear your heart crying out for me (crying out for me) 
I can hear your heart(oh yeah)crying out for me 
(And girl it's saying) 
Come on in, come on in, come on in and save me (Save me) 
Come on in, come on in, come on in and save me (oh oh oh) 
I can hear your heart (I can hear it yeah) crying out for me 
Girl it's crying it's crying 
I don't wanna confuse things (no) 
But I just can't keep lying to myself 
When you're holding me (when you're holding me) 
I can feel your pain oh baby let me be your dream 
I'm the answer come see me (see me) 
And u don't have to cry no more (no more) 
Girl I can hear your heart baby

Girl it's crying 
Won't you listen to your heart, baby 
I can hear your heart crying out for me 
(girl it's crying out for me)

(And it's saying) 
Come on in, come on in, come on in and save me (Save me) 
Come on in, come on in, come on in and save me 
I can hear your heart crying out for me 
Girl I can hear it, hear it... cryin for me, for me, for me, for me 
Ladies wave your hands in the air
