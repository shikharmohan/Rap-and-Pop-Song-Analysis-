I'd like to thank the mack god for all tha playa prophets that he sent
I'd like to thank him for Donald Going and Iceberg Slim
  for dottin their I's and crossin their T's, poppin their P's, and
  flexin their G's
I'd like to thank the mack god for all the playa prophets that he
  sent before me and 40 water
For the mack I chose 40 water
To come into the world and change and rearrange
To lace the suckers and the anti playa
He came in the middle of the Atlantic ocean, on the glad sandwich bag
  and floated ashore
And as soon as he hit the shore, he balanced the game
He said that nine-tenths of his law was possession
And that nine-tenths of his game was position
And that everything was done on the approach
The mack god said that he would send an extraordinary one
On the side of 40 water and he won't just be a playa
He will be an extraordinary playa
Now we gonna turn the mack book from page 211 to chapter 187
And it talks about how they had a kangaroo court for the playas
And how dem suckas is out there with trumped up charged on E-40
Well, if you wanna judge the 40 water, bring him before 12 G's
And open his files
And you will see that he has been true with a capital T since he
  was knee high to a grasshopper
That the mack god said that in the year 1555, that there was a
  great explosion and some of the playas inhaled some fumes
  pertaining additives, preservatives and artificial flavors
The mack god refers to them as suckas
And he said that he would send one that would come from one
That was despised and rejected
And that he would send this extraordinary one in the world
And when he come, he would come with ten commandments
And the commandments would be:
  Thou shall not snitch
  Thou shall not infiltrate
  Thou shall not perpetrate
  Thou shall not playa hate
  Thou shall not hold trust
  Thou shall not hold say
  Thou shall not pay a trick
  Thou shall not disrespect the game
  Thou shall not be broke
  And thou shall not be without their thang
The mack god said that just because you meet a hoe
And she wears a jersey that say champion and eat a bowl of wheaties
Don't make her a winner
Will she sell her hips, her lips and her fingertips
Will you tear down doors
And knock out CO's
Can you go the distance
Will you be the one with the checkered flag in your hand
Yeah, 'cause I will be the winner
