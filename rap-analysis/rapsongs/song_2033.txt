This one's for my brother, Tyree, R.I.P
A message to God
Since you finishin' 'em early, what possessed you to start him?
We made a vow, later we'll regret till death do us part
Lord, I thought we was made for each other
You shouldn't connect those made to be taken away from each other
Now, what I'm supposed to do, I'm only half the man that I was
I'll never last 'cause my better half is up there with you
You knew what you was doin' when you made us
So with all due respect, you could'a forgave him
You didn't have to take him
He can take the game with him, 'cause he defines the word
The one who puts the G in it, who you think put me in it?
I'm feelin' like my whole world is blinded, wonderin' why
Cryin', pourin' out my heart, pourin' out liquor behind it
We fought like brothers, somethin' we never should do
We could'a used time spent arguin', tellin' the truth
He had talent too, I had plans on watchin' him grow
Don't know what hurts more, seein' him leave, or watchin' him go
Listen, listen, listen, oh
  (Listen, listen)
Listen, listen, listen, oh
  (Better listen)
Listen, listen, listen
Listen
If you wonder why
(Why I live my life)
The way that I do
('Cause I got to get this money)
So don't worry about me
('Cause I know my way around)
I'm just hustlin' everyday
Runnin' this race, makin' this paper
You's a soldier, you're probably packin' heat up there
Met up with homies from the street and got deep up there
If you only knew the way I felt before they ruined the crew
I thought I learned from Eazy, now I'm goin' through it with you
We lost a thug, a son and a father
I spoke to your son the other day and told him Uncle Dre got him
The Lord must be accidentally pullin' your file
'Cause I'm still paging you, 911, straight in denial
Prayin' you get it but no man can choose the card he was dealt
You either quit or you gon' play it like you get it
I have been through all emotions, from in shock to keepin' a poker face
To straight breakin' down and showin' all emotions
I'm anxious to believin' real G's don't cry
If that's the truth, then I'm realizin' I ain't no gangsta
It's just not me but you know I'ma always ride with you
I miss you, sometimes I wish I just died with you
Listen, listen, listen, oh
  (Listen, listen)
Listen, listen, listen, oh
Listen, listen, listen
Listen
If you wonder why
(Why I live my life)
The way that I do
('Cause I got to get this money)
So don't worry about me
(Don't worry, don't worry)
'Cause I'm just hustlin' everyday
Runnin' this race, makin' this paper
Listen, mmm
If you don't know why
You better listen up right now
Listen, listen, listen, listen, ohh
Listen, listen, yeah yeah yeah
Listen, listen, children, listen
I'm tryin' to tell you somethin' good
Don't get caught up in the 'hood
Yeah, yeah, ohh
If you don't know why
You gotta find out the reason why
(Brother, brother)
