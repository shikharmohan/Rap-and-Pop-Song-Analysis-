[Leela James]
Had things on my mind
I tried to get by
Things ain't goin right
Workin day and night
Gon' keep on movin on
Cause a new day gon' come
Gotta hold on
Cause it won't be very long
[Chorus: Leela James]
We'll be alright (in the morning) no tears to dry (struggle comin)
Hold your head high (I know) ooh bye and bye (it won't be long)
We'll be alright (in the morning) no tears to dry (struggle comin)
Hold your head high (I know) ooh bye and bye (early morning)
[Leela James]
Feels like {?}
You know that's a crime
Too much on my side
Somebody tell me why
Well my brother stay strong
Sister hold on
Cause a new day gon' come
And it won't be very long
Won't be very long
It won't be very long
It won't be very long
It won't be very long
[Chorus] - 2X
[Leela James]
It won't be long, no
I said it won't be long
So don't you worry
Don't worry, worry
Cause struggle don't last always
No no no no
Joy come in the morning
[Chorus] - 2X to fade
