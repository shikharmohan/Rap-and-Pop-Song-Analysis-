(Queen Latifah)
Yo what's up this is Queen Latifah in the house
Definetely representin Jersey on the love love
Coolin' in the county; shoot (???)
But damn I miss home
[Chorus 4X]
I can't.. forget New Jersey
(Verse 1: Queen Latifah)
When I think of home I think of a place where theres no over-flowin
And all my family and peeps I knew when I was growin
Mommy and daddy made me proud to in Owens
So for me to keep goin, I would become
Her eminental royal highness
The Queen Latifah; no doubt; one of New Jersey's finest
So, said it all
Get up on all of my own
Cause Jersey's what I think about when I think of home
Don't let know one get close to you except the chosen
Stick with the ones who meant the most to you 
when you were broke and blue, that's how fam do
That's how you stay true around these snakes
that freakin' smile when they hate you
I'm quick to take the ride down for in-town
(Just another day living on a down)
My experience legit, my rhymes is on hit
It's mad truth to the room where we the shit; I can't forget
[Chorus]
(Verse 2: Queen Latifah)
I used to work at Burger King but after takin orders
I used to take the path to Latin Quarters across the waters
Where I learned to do the Who, yo, I couldn't stop
I brought it back around the way to show the peple on my block
Teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it
It looks so simple like that there's nothin to it
So, we meet in Irvington and after school I run
To the Willobrook Mall, there was Solamon
I had a talent for getting up for gear
A petty thief, small time crook of the year
But I chilled cause I had bigger dreams than to steal
And Ramsey came for me and Patchy to put our voices on a reel
And I could hear myself on the radio
"45 King Special Red Alert Show"
Cause that's what life was all about to me
All E-E flavor you did it, represent Jersey
[Chorus]
(Verse 3: Queen Latifah)
I think about my mom and my brothers when I'm all swoll
Shock, Kim, when I'm all swoll
My baby sister. when I'm all swoll
Hostan, when I'm all swoll
Ill-Town, when I all swoll
Jill-Town, J.C, when I'm all swoll
(???) to (???) so on, when I'm all swoll
Recognize the whole mama soul
We got Naughty
In another words we got Nicky
We got Redman, the Order Facts and Whitney (???)
Bruce Springsteen, and a house ah blacks
Shaquille O'Neal, oh he'll catch rack
Tisha Campbell, Jerry Lewis, Tony Bennett
Back spin, or spin it,
Thursday peppermint and I'm in it
Shag do's, I does no fo's in the spot
Cause them peeps is my peeps and my back is got
Nuf' respect to your burough, your block
You're black; I love to see us move as a flock
Unscrapped, against each other
No body armor
Nobody harms a hair on a head, everything calmer
We ghetto stars and fools
We paid the dues
We made the blues
So come on with the come on
And get down with the get down
I'm down with my hometown sound
[Chorus]
