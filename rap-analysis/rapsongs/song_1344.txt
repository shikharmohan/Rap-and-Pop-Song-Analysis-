Who you tryin' to get crazy with ese?
Don't you know I'm loco?
To da one on da flamboyant tip
I'll just toss that ham in the fryin' pan like spam
Get done when I come and slam
Damn, I feel like the Son of Sam
Don't make me wreck shit, hectic
Next, get the chair, got me goin' like General Electric
And the lights are blinkin', I'm thinkin'
It's all over when I go out drinkin'
Oh, makin' my mind slow
That's why I don't fuck with the big four, oh
Bro, I got ta' maintain
'Cause a nigga like me is goin' insane
Insane in da membrane
(Insane in da brain)
Insane in da membrane
(Insane in da brain)
Insane in da membrane
(Crazy insane, got no brain)
Insane in da membrane
(Insane in da brain)
Do my shit undercover now it's time for the blubba
Blabber, to watch that belly get fatter
Fat boy on a diet, don't try it
I'll jack yo' ass like a looter in a riot
My shit's fat, like a sumo, slammin' dat ass
Leavin' yo' face in the grass
'Cause you know, I don't take a dulo, lightly
Punks just jealous cause they can't outwrite me
Or kick that style, wicked, wild
Happy face nigga never seen me smile
Rip dat mainframe, I'll explain
A nigga like me is goin' insane
Insane in da membrane
(Insane in da brain)
Insane in da membrane
(Insane in da brain)
Insane in da membrane
(Crazy insane, got no brain)
Insane in da membrane
(Insane in da brain)
Insane in da brain
Insane in da brain
Insane in da brain
Insane in da brain
Like Louie Armstrong, played the trumpet
I'll hit that bong and break ya off somethin' soon
I got ta get my props
Cops, come and try to snatch my crops
These pigs wanna blow my house down
Head underground, to the next town
They get mad when they come to raid my pad
And I'm out in the nine-deuce Cad
Yes, I'm the pirate, pilot of this ship
If I get with the ultraviolet dream
Hide from the red light beam
Now do you believe in the unseen?
Look, but don't make you eyes strain
A nigga like me is goin' insane
Insane in da membrane
(Insane in da brain)
Insane in da membrane
(Insane in da brain)
Insane in da membrane
(Crazy insane, got no brain)
Insane in da membrane
(Insane in da brain)
Insane in da brain
Insane in da brain
Insane in da brain
Insane in da brain
