Yea....You know what it is!
Ow! Killahouse! Uh!
Yo, the whole city's on my motherfuckin' back, ya'll
I'ma snap, ya'll
When I rack, ya'll
The whole city's on my motherfuckin' back, ya'll
From the Southside got to get to the North, ya'll
[Chorus]x4
Jump out with my shotgun, make you dead niggas drop (drop)
Niggas rock (rock), show yo true crime
(sirens)
Yo, I pull up on the block
Cool it out, move it out
Chop it up, chew it out
Leftovers, threw it out
My CD in the streets, smell like a sewer out
Bricks put my music out
Shotgun, do it now!
[Chorus]x4
Jump out with my shotgun, make you dead niggas drop (drop)
Niggas rock (rock), show yo true crime
(sirens)
The new Redman CD is out
And not only bitches goin' wild; Niggas goin' wild too!
...Bitches...Niggas...
...Bitches...Niggas...
...Bitches...Niggas...
...Bitches...Niggas...
...Bitches...Niggas...
Yea....WKYA, Gillahouse Radio
We be kickin' yo' motherfuckin' ass
It's about 45ÃÃÂ° outside, but it's hot as a motherfucker in my car
'Cause I'm smokin' weed
Brick City is up in this bitch, and we smokin' weed
True Crime is definitely smokin' weed up in this motherfucker
And I'm out (And I'm out)
