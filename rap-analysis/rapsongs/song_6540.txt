It's 50 Cent and S N double O P
You don't want no Snoop and you don't want it wit me
Every time I come around they like, "Oh no"
I get to trippin' slap the clip up in my 44
Shit, I been through in my hood made my heart cold
I get to poppin' off that thang like I'm loco
No sense in coppin' pleas
When you see my knife out
(Knife out)
Motherfuckers light out
(Lights out)
Here comes Snoop
(Oh shit, oh no)
Sup, nigga, sup, now
(Oh no)
Ricky Ticky Timble, C's is the symbol
Courdoroy khakis, stacies and brimmed up
Straight razors just to keep you trimmed up
1 8 7, oh yeah, now you remember
He's electrifyin' and original
So gangster, Snoop Dogg the criminal
The one you hate to love in the club, in the cut
Hugged up wit yo bitch, nigga, I don't give a shit
You betta check dat ho that's what wreckin' G
Now, step your game down 'cause ain't no checkin' me
You'll be respectin' me until you leave this room
Or my gat'll go boom, bullets go zoom
Now, your names on a tomb
They pourin' out liquor wit no room to consume, you silly bafoon
I pop niggas like balloons, I ain't feelin' 'em
Walkin' in my big, blue chucks 'cause I'm killin' 'em
Every time I come around they like, "Oh no"
I get to trippin' slap the clip up in my 44
Shit, I been through in my hood made my heart cold
I get to poppin' off that thang like I'm loco
No sense in coppin' pleas
When you see my knife out
(Knife out)
Motherfuckers light out
(Lights out)
Hey whaddup 'cuz it's 50 Cent, what's happenin', nigga?
Ever since the moment I was born I been dyin'
(Yeah)
Hundred miles an hour, pulse flyin' wit my eye an
He who fears fate lives like a coward
You go against me, you'll be devoured
Then you get to poppin' you'll have a change of heart
I hit your chest a couple times you'll have to change your heart
Have doc usin' donors, dead niggas with spare parts
You come back wit lungs of a snitch an the heart of a dead nark
Niggas never see the light till it spark
Then they bleed, it get cold then shit get dark
You can call me the beast from the East, I run these streets
You can eat hollow tip shells or you can work for me
These rap niggas crazy, my mercy has limits
Push me a hundred revolvers'll get to spinnin'
Your services are no longer needed, rock a bye, baby
My bitch'll do it to you with a lil' 380
(Yeah)
Every time I come around they like, "Oh no"
I get to trippin' slap the clip up in my 44
Shit, I been through in my hood made my heart cold
I get to poppin' off that thang like I'm loco
No sense in coppin' pleas
When you see my knife out
(Knife out)
Motherfuckers light out
(Lights out)
I'm bailin' through the door again
Let the Momo pour again
Me and my ho again
Yeah, she got the four up in this motherfucker
And I'ma bust it if you try to rush us
Or touch us or sucka duck us
It'll crack off, now, back off real slow
An if you don't know, I never hesitate to shoot a ho
Yeah that's my reputation, you test my patience and
You and your fam bam gon' hear the blam, blam
Goddammit, I'm at it again
They done let that bitch, nigga up outta the pen
And now he lookin' for me what the heck? My game is built on respect
Now, I'm breathin' down your mortherfuckin' neck
I dumps till my clips is empty
I'm headin' down Willshire to San Vicente
And when I get there don't ask who sent me
Just take dem shots an drop it like it's hot
Bitch, nigga
Every time I come around they like, "Oh no"
I get to trippin' slap the clip up in my 44
Shit, I been through in my hood made my heart cold
I get to poppin' off that thang like I'm loco
No sense in coppin' pleas
When you see my knife out
(Knife out)
Motherfuckers light out
(Lights out)
Yea, nigga, just when you thought I was gone
Slide back up on you like the wind, nigga
Hurricane D O double G
With the G,G,G,G,G, G-unit
