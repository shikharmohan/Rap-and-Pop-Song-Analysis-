Ahh haa
Yea yea
Ahh haa
First of all, we the one and only infamous
Everybody wanna use the name
Soundin' all blame
We come up in the party
With them shanks and things
Have you curled up on the floor
Feelin' the pain
And nine times outta ten
We ain't even start the shit
We finish it
Then they wanna press charges
Plus everybody and their mother
Wanna act tough
'Til they discover how fast a nigga
Leave them under white covers
Was a thumper
Till he met the forty thunder
Now I feel strange
When I walk by his mother
It's fucked up
That's how the ball bounce
The cookie crumbles
That's what the guns do
Dead you, on the humble
But God forgive me
Niggas tryin' to hit me
What I'm supposed to do
You talk about my life
And a nigga got a lot to loose
So I, tuck the heaters
Then proceed to move
We a mob for real
You an example
You should spread love not war
'Cause my shit is poppin'
And I'd be God damned if you shot me
You should spread love not war
'Cause you won't feel safe
Comin' out your crib, knowin' that we got beef
You should spread love not war
Just think about your kids
How they need you alive for your guidance
You should spread love not war
'Cause death hurts whole families
  (Yea, yea)
Imagine it's your mom that grieves
Two in the neck
Yes you will, if you
Not feelin' me yet
Outta respect
Can't stand it man
You niggas is sex
Sweatin' hard ain't do shit
But run your list
But when a nigga get confronted
All he do is take the fifth
Not the long, talk about the four
Niggas is raw
You ain't know, now you know
Leakin' down on the floor
Never a need for my words
Believe what you heard
Never flash a gat and go bust it
That shit is absurd
'Cause I be right back
To my brother say word
You got to drive, no doubt
I cock it bein' tougher for herbs
'Cause the, plot is power
An I do it for hours
Won't save me for a minute
Till I move on you cowards
Direct, drama to us
Infamous be the ones and we rowdy
Million dollar ballad
Make an album, get classes
You should spread love not war
'Cause my shit is poppin'
And I'd be God damned if you shot me
We should spread love not war
'Cause you won't feel safe
Comin' out your ass, knowin' that we got beef
You should spread love not war
Just think about your kids
How they need you alive for their guidance
We should spread love not war
'Cause death hurts whole families
Imagine it's your mom that grieves
Look around your
Surrounded by the M O B
B D E E P
Infamous niggas rep
Queens bridge housing P's
My dunns come through
With the big long chains
Plus we got guns, to blow your brains
Niggas learn when they feel the pain
Know what sayin'?
Straight like that
Standin' ovation with Max
We clap niggas for less
Splash niggas for laughs
Shift the game
Raise your odds
I need ninety three thousand
For sixteen bars
Put out the movie
The hoods rush the stores
Seven hundred thousand
From out the doors
We the most thorough
Need I say more?
The hoes love the morgue
'Cause we so raw
Handcuff you whore
When P come through the scene
Glowin' like a black light
On white clothin
You should spread love not war
'Cause my shit is poppin'
And I'd be God damned if you shot me
We should spread love not war
'Cause you won't feel safe
Comin' out your ass, knowin' that we got beef
We need to spread love not war
Just think about your kids
How they need you alive for their guidance
You should spread love not war
'Cause death hurts whole families
Imagine it's your mom that grieves
You should spread love not war
'Cause my shit is poppin'
And I'd be God damned if you shot me
You should spread love not war
'Cause you won't feel safe
Comin' out your ass, knowin' that we got beef
We need to spread love not war
Just think about your kids
How they need you alive for their guidance
You should spread love not war
'Cause death hurts whole families
Imagine it's your mom that grieves
You should spread love not war
'Cause my shit is poppin'
And I'd be God damned if you shot me
You should spread love not war
'Cause I don't give a fuck
  (Nigga what's up)
  (War)
We need to spread love not war
