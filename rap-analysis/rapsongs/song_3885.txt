[Puffy]
Where my Queen at?!
[Lil' Kim]
Uh, uh huh
Yo, Bad Boy
Queen Bee, B.I.G.
Come on, come on
Uh, uh huh, that's right
Check me out, Q.B.
Uh, uh, uh
[Lil' Kim]
If I could make it rain
I'd make it rain diamonds
So all my girls in the world could keep shrinin'
From Princess cuts to emeralds to H-classes
Yeah, I failed math, but bet I passed the E-class
Went from Chanel No. 5 to two point five
The Melrose resident, every rooms a president
With the lift in wagers, bet ya'll haters can't match that
You're six digits short to catch that (what)
Your net year gross it 20 thou' on commission
My net week gross 100 mil in addition to to the Dow Jones
Stocks, restaurants out in Rome
Plus all the overhead
And the interest on them loans
1 -     I want diamonds
    She said she wants a man to buy her a Lexus Lans
    But that's all right (that's all right)
    But still it ain't enough for me
    I want diamonds
    She said she wants a guy
    To do it to her every night
    That's all right (that's all right)
    But you gotta go down on me
[Lil' Kim]
I had bitches rockin' the red, yellow and green wigs
Cats in they raps tryin' to act like B.I.G.
Remember when Big told ya'll "Get Money"
Remember when Big said play them niggas like dummies, check it
If I could separate all the game from the glory
I'd rather be with Frank, but that's a different story
Cause now a days niggas ain't sayin shit (word)
Runnin off at the lips about what they gonna get
And what they had in '86
I puts them on the spot
Pull out the lap top with the receipt for the yacht
What you got?
Niggas be mute all of a sudden
What, I pushed a button
Shit, that ain't nothin'
[Tonya]
I don't care if he's young or old
Just make him very rich
I just want someone that can spend on me
I want diamonds
Yes I do (girl)
Oh, on and on
And man with lots of dough
And a house that's made of gold
[Lil' Kim]
There's only one thing better than money
Come into my bedroom honey
[Lil' Kim]
Then we can have a drink or two
Cosmos, if you ghetto this Bud's for you
Here's a few
So he can be nice, when I show him this ice on my chest
That I bought with his American Express
I'm a mess, never the less
I'm authentic
Ninety-nine percent B.K., one percent N.J.
Excuse me cause what I'm tryin to say
Is if you ain't thorough
Stay out my borough
Cause when my gun burn, it's loud like Pyros
And when it's your turn, you fold like Gyros
Uh, and ya'll buy your suits in portions
I get mine's from an auction
Million dollar dress that belongs to the Princess
While ya'll shopping at Sax
I been there, done that
Got the sweater and the hat
[Tonya]
I want diamonds
Oh, yeah on and on
Gimme all your money
With a lots of drops
And a house that's made of gold
I want diamonds
[Lil' Kim]
Just gimme scent of Bahamas
And sections of your money
Ya'll know I am the Queen Bee
Baddest bitch in this industry
(I want diamonds)
Just gimme scent of Bahamas
And sections of your money
Ya'll know I am the Queen Bee
Baddest bitch in this industry
