Ain't it amazing how crazy the hood done made me?
Feels like my emotions are froze, I stay G'D up
It's the things I done seen and shit I been through
That make my heart turn cold, I stay G'D up
I'm a gangsta, you find out for sure
If you ever step on my toes, I stay G'D up
When I'm hangin' out that window with that AK
Fillin' your punk ass with holes, I stay G'D up
Cocaine, heroin, ecstasy, marijuana
I'm mule on that Greyhound from NY to the Carolina
Paper chase, different name, same face, don't catch a case
My road dog's on parole, his baby girl's four years old
We play the block, pistol cocked, you could shoot or get shot
Kill you for your crack spot, take everything your ass got
Semi-automatic spray, bust back or run away
Niggas talkin' in the hood, we'll handle this another day
In November, you make my shit that should dead you
You can catch for Christmas, I'll send you a gift
Niggas'll come and leave your ass twisted
Them hollow tip shells, burn, baby, burn
See niggas get merked up, babies born and the world turn
I seen it all crystal clear, so, I keep my pistol near
Heart's never full of fear, homie, I stay well aware
Of what's going on around me, motherfuckers want me dead
I go wit a smile on my face when it's my time, kid
Ain't it amazing how crazy the hood done made me?
Feels like my emotions are froze, I stay G'D up
It's the things I done seen and shit I been through
That make my heart turn cold, I stay G'D up
I'm a gangsta, you find out for sure
If you ever step on my toes, I stay G'D up
When I'm hangin' out that window with that AK
Fillin' your punk ass with holes
Lil nigga,  I done paved the way, y'all should thank 'em
But if you think otherwise, bring your boy over here, so I can spank 'em
I'll put an end to your career, bitch
Before you speak on 50, buy a .40 and a spare clip
These niggas gassed up, gettin' to used to rap
Like I won't give 'em more bloodclots than Supercat
Niggas'll snatch ya, I'm like a bat catcher
I'll give a sign and they post somethin' at cha
'Round here, niggas die of hydro
And even when it ain't 4th of July, it sound like pyro
You smart enough to creep then lay your dumb brains down
The pound'll spin you around like the young James Brown
I know I'm hot but, hey, I'm icy too
Rocks'll ll hit you from a block away like a beat from Dr. Dre
We're takin' over this year, K's and the soldiers is here
Everyone knows it's a scare
Ain't it amazing how crazy the hood done made me?
Feels like my emotions are froze, I stay G'D up
It's the things I done seen and shit I been through
That make my heart turn cold, I stay G'D up
I'm a gangsta, you find out for sure
If you ever step on my toes, I stay G'D up
When I'm hangin' out that window with that AK
Fillin' your punk ass with holes
My papa never bothered to show me what it was to be a man
He'd just pop another bottle and smoke up a half a gram
I would hop in my Impala and ride all through the night
That gave my homeboy light, so when you do it, do it right
My fingernails still filled with cocaine residue
I still got the heart to go and bust me a head or two
No other solution, you think we hollerin and hootin'
Until you wake up and then you got ta hear 'bout these shootings
I take a pull from [Incomprehensible] when he  put the clip in my pocket
Before I take another bullet, I'm gonna pull it and pop it
And if it's beef my nigga, then let your guns do your talkin'
The graveyard has got plenty room for a coffin
They say that we responsible for boostin' the crime rate
They say that we the reason that these young niggas buyin' weight
But I'm gonna keep this glock on my waist 'til my dayin' days
It's nuttin' but a G thang, G-Unit and Dr. Dre
Ain't it amazing how crazy the hood done made me?
Feels like my emotions are froze, I stay G'D up
It's the things I done seen and shit I been through
That make my heart turn cold, I stay G'D up
I'm a gangsta, you find out for sure
If you ever step on my toes, I stay G'D up
When I'm hangin' out that window with that AK
Fillin' your punk ass with holes, I stay G'D up
