Hell no, I can't quit
Hell no man, we got to much money
To get shawty stay down grand hustle, look
I'm this far from bein' the star and just that close to quittin'
I never should've came close to missin'
But I want to be a musician pimpin' not a politician
Listen, feel my position this a rough transition
Plus I'm way to deep in the game to be tryin' to change
From fortune and fame and glamor I could be in the slammer
Or six feet under Atlanta it's a blessing to breath
I walk the streets with seven felonies I'm blessed to be free
Long as somebody up in heaven who keep blessing the G
T I P is still be blessing CD's so haters you can see these
'Cause I'm back now with somethin' to prove
Everythin' to gain pimpin' nothing to lose
I oughta start smackin' niggas when there's nothin' to do
They to big shoot 'em in the leg and even the odds
'Cause you ain't hard, less you round with captain C Rod
Trap with K T and brawl with J R
Fuck hoes with D P broke bread with J G
Switch labels like K P poofa did all that to me
Even though I'd rather go back to slangin' drugs an' shit
This a gang of niggas and bitches really love this shit
I can't quit even though police's hate on legit
And rappers hate it 'cause they know I'm the shit
Hell now I can't quit, some niggas hatin' on the money I'm gettin'
Most of them hatin' 'cause I'm fuckin' they bitch
Now pimpin', I can't quit, some niggas hatin' on the rocks and the rings
Some of 'em hate 'cause they all think I'm the king
Hell now I can't quit, some people hate it when you better then them
They ain't hate start worryin' then, hey I'm winnin' I can't quit
Ten years an album and two deals for real
We all know I should of sold two million at least
It's all good though I flow for the streets
I do it for ya'll every weekend, you see who in the mall
'Cause still in the traps signing your shirts given you doubt
Kickin' it with ya then get you and your folk in the club
Holes of the pictures where girls gave kisses and hugs
Hold and I look at the show passin' niggas the drove
One of the realist rappers niggas will know
But niggas be hatin' to the point where they be calling the station
But they respect it 'cause I'm ready and focused
Then I see they panties an' vocals
I want you to know this the closest you know this
Niggas in the game ain't real got to stay sellin' records
'Cause the fame ain't shit and fuck the units that they name will sell
It'll break your heart to see your favorite rappers lame as hell
I can't quit even though police's hate on legit
And rappers hate it 'cause they know I'm the shit
Hell now I can't quit, some niggas hatin' on the money I'm gettin'
Most of them hatin' 'cause I'm fuckin' they bitch
Now pimpin', I can't quit, some niggas hatin' on the rocks and the rings
Some of 'em hate 'cause they all think I'm the king
Hell now I can't quit, some people hate it when you better then them
They ain't hate start worryin' then, hey I'm winnin' I can't quit
Some of the people some of times
Some of you rhyme but might not like one of them lines
I tell you what, I let you criticize me one of them times
Those of you that think I'm too cocky get in front of the line
Whether you don't like my ego or my arrogant flow
Don't like it when you say I'm tyte, I say I already know
Don't like how I was talkin' shit before my album blowed
Think I need to calm it down be more like the average Joe
So, fuck your little thoughts and that little house you think I'm in
Get a Benz I value your opinion
Think I give a fuck how many times my record spins?
Well, what you recommend? I'm back again
I can't quit even though police's hate on legit
And rappers hate it 'cause they know I'm the shit
Hell now I can't quit, some niggas hatin' on the money I'm gettin'
Most of them hatin' 'cause I'm fuckin' they bitch
Now pimpin', I can't quit, some niggas hatin' on the rocks and the rings
Some of 'em hate 'cause they all think I'm the king
Hell now I can't quit, some people hate it when you better then them
They ain't hate start worryin' then, hey I'm winnin' I can't quit
