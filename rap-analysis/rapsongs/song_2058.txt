[[Intro]]
Yeaaaah... Aftermath... D.R.E.
[[Verse One]]
It ain't too much I haven't seen,
touched or been through, 
always on the move so I'm sorry if I offend you,
but I got million dollar deals to attend to,
time is money, and I don't have a second to lend you,
I am the one, with the empire to run
West Coast messiah, best known for fire,
Throw up your sets loc, the chronic smoke retired,
no more low riders and golden spokes on tires?
SSSSSSSSSTOP!,
I just had the Detox, 
now I'm back on the block, like classic Reeboks,
as the beat knocks, you can put it in the air,
couple of my artists beefin' but I wouldn't interfere,
my style is innovation, trials and tribulations,
you can't rush perfection, so thanks for your patience,
got on my troops, assembled in groups,
ready to shoot, dressed in bulletproof khaki suits like that...
[[Chorus]]
It's like that, these cats are sick without me,
When you need the medicine who they tell you to go see?
Never seen all you lookin' so lonely,
But the Doc's office is open, prescribin' you what you need,
Got my patients out there waitin', the line is out the door,
(Got my patients out, dooooooor)
Here's a dose of, what you folks have been out there lookin' for...
(Ohhh, Ouhhhhh, it's like that)
[[Verse Two]]
It ain't another nigga that can play how I play,
who else can take a longer hiatus than Sade,
come back and blow the scene up, sorta like Bombay,
you on the road to success, but you're goin' the wrong way,
what up mo! I'm California's own, homegrown,
light up a zone, and smoke out, 'till your brains blown,
me and Nate Dogg, on the same song,
now that's something you can definitely bank on,
tell me how you seen a producer that's meaner,
with beats I'm a beast, like Toto Riina, I had my fair share of, courtroom subpoenas,
now, I'm tryin' to live my life a little bit cleaner,
change is what I had to do,
I used to be a ruthless nigga with a attitude,
made a lotta doe, then got senses to life on death row,
I won my appeal, and drove off on three wheels, like that...
[[Chorus]]
It's like that, these cats are sick without me,
When you need the medicine who they tell you to go see?,
Never seen all you lookin' so lonely,
But the Doc's office is open, prescribin' you what you need,
Got my patients out there waitin', the line is out the door,
(Got my patients out, dooooooor)
Here's a dose of, what you folks have been out there lookin' for...
(Ohhh, Ouhhhhh, it's like that)
[[Verse Three]]
Compton's full of armed thieves and G's that'll do ya,
so please don't let the palm trees and cool breeze fool ya,
ya heard it first here, I've birthed the careers of almost,
every hot rapper in the past 20 years, 
you would think dudes happily, would name a school after me,
but instead they see me at events, and start attackin' me,
but my faculty, is standin' right in back of me,
you must like sippin' food through a straw like a Daiquiri
come on, man... who you pretendin' to touch?,
when the shit goes down, I don't gotta do much,
Buck, poke a hole in him, like a stem in a dutch,
we ain't tough nahhh... we just defendin' what's us,
I got a lot to lose, the drop-tops, yachts and jewels,
that's why I spot the fool, tryin' to stop my moves,
I'm not takin' losses, I hang with bosses
that can buy anything, like fuck what the cost is,
it's like that...
[[Chorus]]
It's like that, these cats are sick without me,
When you need the medicine who they tell you to go see?,
Never seen all you lookin' so lonely,
But the Doc's office is open, prescribin' you what you need,
Got my patients out there waitin', the line is out the door,
(Got my patients out, dooooooor)
Here's a dose of, what you folks have been out there lookin' for...
(Ohhh, Ouhhhhh, it's like that)
