This Wut U Call Higher Learnin (Yup)
So Listenin Up Grab A Chair, Have A Seat
Crack A Beer, Smoke A Blunt
Watch Me The Captins Here
Louie Vutton Sneaks On The Pedal
Do A Hundred For A Mile 
Like My Feet Went To Sleep On The Pedal
And No Longer Am I Gonna Pop Tags Off My Clothes
Dudes Need To Know I Spent Big Cash On My Clothes
No Cash On My Hoes, I Just Pass On My Hoes
Till My Niggas Let Em Hit It
Then They Get Passed On Some More
Got My System On Dunk
And Its Rattlin The Trunk
Niggas Know How I Get Down
They Just Glad It Aint Da Punk Bangin
[Chorus:]
Rubber Burnin Turnin Corners Beatin Like A Congo [x2]
Drop Top Flip Flop Shine As The Chrome Glow
Blowin Dro On 24's Livin How The Song Goes
Rubber Burnin 
Rubber Burnin 
Drop Top Flip Flop Shine As The Chrome Glow
Blowin Dro On 24's Livin As The Song Goes
[Verse 2:]

I Cant Feel My Face
Cocky In Da Coupe But They Love It
Sittin On Buttons
A Pair Of 20 Sumthins
Tires So Skinny Like Im Sittin On Nothin
Leather So Soft Like Im Sittin On Muffins
Beatin Up The Block, Knockin Pictures Off The Wall
Baby I Can Drop The Top And We Can Talk Til The Lawn
And You Kno I Got The Stash Spot, Not
Cuz Whea Im From You Need Your Gats Out And Cock

20 G's In These Back Pockets In Case I Fall
Im Stuntin, Check My Pants, I Get Dat Cash
In Da Phantom Wit Loiusana Plates On My Ass
[Chorus:]
Rubber Burnin Turnin Corners Beatin Like A Congo [x2]
Drop Top Flip Flop Shine As The Chrome Glow
Blowin Dro On 24's Livin How The Song Goes
Rubber Burnin 
Rubber Burnin 
Drop Top Flip Flop Shine As The Chrome Glow
Blowin Dro On 24's Livin As The Song Goes
