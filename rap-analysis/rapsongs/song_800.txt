Listen, I am the sun, I am the sea
I am the land, I am the tree
I'm everything you want to be
'Cause I be struttin' like a G.O.D.
'Cause I be struttin' like a G.O.D.
'Cause I be struttin' like a G.O.D.
Listen, I am the sun, I am the sea
I am the land, I am the tree
I'm everything you want to be
'Cause I be struttin' like a G.O.D.
'Cause I be struttin' like a G.O.D.
'Cause I be struttin' like a G.O.D.
Roll out the red carpet, baby, the God has come
No matter who you are or wherever you from
Check it, I stay be repin' the street and reppin' the slum
And while you co-starrin' this movie I star is the one, listen
You never imagined that I would become
One of the most incredible until whenever I'm done
Notice the God like meet you from when I was young
Blessed with such a maculess flow and a venomous tongue
How we keep you holla until you collapse on the lung
With the biggest followin' the nigga slackin' a nun
Able to move a mountain of niggaz havin' then sprung
Just check out my women but how be havin' then strung ass though
Like how the coke be havin' them numb
Run up in the spot like I was holdin' and clappin' the gun
Now I'm lose for y'all I'm bringin' the proof to y'all
Ballin' and speakin' the truth to y'all
I am the sun, I am the sea
I am the land, I am the tree
I'm everything you want to be
'Cause I be struttin' like a G.O.D.
'Cause I be struttin' like a G.O.D.
'Cause I be struttin' like a G.O.D.
Listen, I am the sun, I am the sea
I am the land, I am the tree
I'm everything you want to be
'Cause I be struttin' like a G.O.D.
'Cause I be struttin' like a G.O.D.
'Cause I be struttin' like a G.O.D.
The chorus is singin' the words that I fill in my gut
That's why I always step with a bop and walk with a strut
And I always rep for the block and we all for the bucks
And we always step in the spot and be all for the cut
Vallet block two parkin' spots all for the truck
Bounce to the world when I be tired and be gone for the month
And it's all for the slut flowin' like a force of the water
Keepin' it runnin' so were the niggaz be at
Well, they seein me commin'
Summers people keep it clapin' women just give me they lovin'
They way the streets be fillin' the kid they really be buggin'
Like I'm there dearly beloved my soldiers really be thuggin'
Or how I really be slugging' the ball out the ball park
Keep them whilin' then ten minutes later then it's sawed off
Create a small spark then down to the levels to make the walls stark
Testin' the God, I think he be needin' them all off
I am the sun, I am the sea
I am the land, I am the tree
I'm everything you want to be
'Cause I be struttin' like a G.O.D.
'Cause I be struttin' like a G.O.D.
'Cause I be struttin' like a G.O.D.
Listen, I am the sun, I am the sea
I am the land, I am the tree
I'm everything you want to be
'Cause I be struttin' like a G.O.D.
'Cause I be struttin' like a G.O.D.
'Cause I be struttin' like a G.O.D.
Listen, I keeps the hustle up in my vain
'Cause it's all in my blood
Feel my pain, feel my love
Feelin' niggaz struggle till the other one
Gettin' to struttin' like the G.O.D.
Gettin' to struttin' like the G.O.D.
Gettin' to struttin' like the G.O.D.
Listen, I'm sayin' we comin' through when I'm blockin' the light
Niggas think they rockin' the crowd but ain't rockin' it right
Make the people shout to the sound and rock for the night
'Cause I stay in the struggle ready rock for the fight
I stay whipin' the truck and leanin' and rock what I like
And quadruple my money more than the block of the white
We sayin' we 'bout [Incomprehensible] stoppin' your rooms
How I be rockin' the diamonds like I'm dropin' them jewels
I am the sun, I am the sea
I am the land, I am the tree
I'm everything you want to be
'Cause I be struttin' like a G.O.D.
'Cause I be struttin' like a G.O.D.
'Cause I be struttin' like a G.O.D.
Listen, I am the sun, I am the sea
I am the land, I am the tree
I'm everything you want to be
'Cause I be struttin' like a G.O.D.
'Cause I be struttin' like a G.O.D.
'Cause I be struttin' like a G.O.D.
