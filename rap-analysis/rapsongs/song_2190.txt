Sixty-eight inches above sea level
Ninety-three million miles above these devils
Play me in the winter, play me in the summer
Play me in the order, any order
Play me in the winter, play me in the summer
Play me in the order, any order
Play me in the winter, play me in the summer
Play me in the order, any order
We got another one pimp
Rock, wake 'em up, boy
Sick with 'em records, E40, Warner Brothers
I'm trying to get my beak wet
I'ma let you shoot the dice and I'm a sign that
Still hungry just ate
My game the same size as a dinner plate
The bay ain't been the same since I took a break
Where you been 40, buying real estate?
I can't stop
Play me fast, fuck around and get mollywopped
Just got my car up out the shop
What color you paint it pimp? Apricot
You 'bout to spot me at a function with a petticoat
Wipin' the sweat off my face with a C-Note
They call me uncle 40 one
The ambassador, the top tamale
And to you slackers tryna' hate
40 [Incomprehensible] doin' great
I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador
I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador
I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador
I'm the ambassador of the game
I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador
I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador
I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador
I'm the ambassador of the game
Play me in the winter , play me in the summer
I'm an old schooler and a newcomer
40 got spinach y'all, he be gassin'
After all these years he still snappin'
That's what people be sayin'
There's something about him, he got some dylon rings
Real balkin', people really care about him
Local boy made good
Ex D-boy made it out the hood
Got his gouda out the park
Used to cook yola in a relish jar
If a sucka' pillow talk and softies out the water
Don't you sit there and let him murder mouth yo' partna'
Teach his ass a lesson
Tune him up, give him the thirty-second treatment
I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador
I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador
I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador
I'm the ambassador of the game
I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador
I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador
I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador
I'm the ambassador of the game
I live in the Bay with the sting rays and sharks
Delta a'eels, blind veels and sky marks
You can't be no mark
Marshmallows get popped if they ain't got no heart
Thumper happy, I hear they like to clap
Don't get mad or come back, get down where they mad at
We'll finish it if you start it
Air the club out like a motherfucka', park it
Money maniac
Scorpio, that's my zodiac
Ain't nothin' new under the sun
I reach in my pocket and give my one to the bums
When the homie go down
We bail his ass out, we pass the hat around
I remember when the thought the west was a goner
I gave us CPR and brought us out of coma
I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador
I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador
I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador
I'm the ambassador of the game
I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador
I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador
I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador
I'm the ambassador of the game
Play me in the winter, play me in the summer
Play me in the order, any order
Play me in the winter, play me in the summer
Play me in the order, any order
Play me in the winter, play me in the summer
Play me in the order, any order
Play me in the winter, play me in the summer
Play me in the order, any order
