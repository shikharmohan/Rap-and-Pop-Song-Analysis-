[Chorus:3X]
'cause were all a little strong 
but as for me I only G when I'm buss'n rocks 
In the beach where the papers long 
Now when I wake up in the morining 
and I get up out my bed 
I fell good, oh yes I do 
Cause I still can give it up for you {What up 'cause} 
[Chorus]
'cause where all a little strong 
In the beach where the papers long 
but as for me I only G when I'm buss'n rocks {Dogg Pound} 
'cause were all a little strong 
In the beach where the papers long 
but as for me I only G when I'm Buss'n rocks {So take that} 
[Verse One:]
You know you gotta have heart 
I told you niggas from the start 
If I'm still in it I'm in it for life 
Always stay down and keep my muthafucking game tight 
'cause ever since elementary or was it pre school cool 
I was a muthafuckin fool 
I had to have papers it was routine 
A young nigga on a mission for them collard greens 
I shake niggas, break niggas, make niggas , shank theyselves 
For fuckin with my wealth 
and it'll catch on 
'cause if it don't it's on 
and 'cause I ain't even slippin when I'm all alone 
Sittin back laughin' in the chronic zone 
Clown me ya gone 
Surround me it's on 
and it's the same old song 
Niggas paper so long 
So if you want me, get me , got me 
but now they call me Snoop Gotti 
They call him Snoop Capone 
Should of had shot him 
and that's all I LBC betta yet 
That's all I DPGC 
[Chorus:2X 
Yea Eastside 
Hook w/ chorus]

[Verse Two]
Tryin to get some bones 
I'm slappin bones 
With some dogg pound gangstas in front of my home 
Bigg 6, bigg 5 3's with ya bitch 
My girls in the kitchen cookin up some fish 
Knuckle head nigga, thought I was slippin 
I'm blastin at this nigga that was trippin 
but I wasn't slippin I was on deck 
I blast his ass peck peck know his shirts wet 
With no remorse, I had to take him out 
Dead gone lights out 
I'm laughin at this shit cause it was funny 
Fuckin with the dogg I take your life and your money 
and now I dip too my spot 
and bet nobody speak on the 8-7 
and set up shop with yo rocks 
'cause still all dogg go to heaven 
From my hood to your hood 
Game reconize it's all to the good 
So heres a toast to the indo 
Doing it like it's the thang to do

[Verse Three]
Freestylin C-stylin 
Snoop and Pooh comin through fixin to take you to the island 
Where the bitches and the bud come free 
and everybody listen to the D-O double G 
Hoes on my dick, niggas on my nuts 
People be lovin me because I drop cuts 
That makes sense and make big money 
See Snoop is that nigga who don't half to play funny

'cause she like that song that the bow wow sing 
I'll put her in a cling 
I won't buy her a ring 
but I'll put her on a hoe stroll make me 
and even if she never saw me befo 
Theres just no way that she can tell me no 
You know my game unbelievable baby 
and it's strong enough to make your grandmama pay me
