The wind is howlin' the rain pours down
Eyes are blood-shot heartbeat pounds
Lights go out the whole world's in darkness
The ground is tremblin', dogs are barkless
In the sky there appears a great light
Burnin' all the flesh off the creatures of the night
Ah, cryin' in a childless tone
Terrified of dyin' a painful death alone
Don't smile lest the innocent child
The power of God is gonna get you through [incomprehensible]
Throw like a hit from the best
Take it in a slump, ha ha, feel it in your chest
Conquerin' the world with the words
Leadin' the children like herds
I can feel it buildin', I'm about to explode
I'm walkin' on the crossroads
People livin' in a shack at the crossroads
Little kids sellin' crack at the crossroads
Let me stab you in the back at the crossroads
Everybody's gettin' jacked walkin' on the crossroads
People livin' in a shack at the crossroads
Little kids sellin' crack at the crossroads
Let me stab you in the back at the crossroads
Everybody's gettin' jacked at the crossroads
Violins and trumpets play
25 thousand people in a golden sleigh
On there way to the promised land
Deliverance but yet some don't understand
Rough on a late night thrill
After midnight kill or be killed
Soldiers, warriors, mercenaries
Crossin' each other on the combat zone
Supreme power on the throne
Lightning strikes in every home
Terrified men run down the street
So many dead bodies, it's hard to eat
Come, we gotta rise above the wall
To see what no man has seen before
Blindin' light that got you through the night
God is on your side, to got in a fight
People livin' in a shack at the crossroads
Little kids sellin' crack at the crossroads
Let me stab you in the back at the crossroads
Everybody's gettin' jacked walkin' on the crossroads
People livin' in a shack at the crossroads
Little kids sellin' crack at the crossroads
Let me stab you in the back at the crossroads
Everybody's gettin' jacked at the crossroads
Homicide, suicide, death, boom, ain't nobody left
Ooh, it's startin' to take effect
You're on your knees, you're scared to death
Tornados with a thousand people spinnin'
One fight at the cross and now God is winin'
The whole Earth cracks in half
The sea turns red from the blood bath
Abandoned buildings burned and two remain
Terrified you feel the fire blaze, the ground can't hold your weight
You reach out to grab the pearly gates
Who clocked this fuck not from space?
Never again will you see the human race
19 angels leadin' the devil straight to hell, torment, pain
What you're seein' here, you can't explain
All your life some men we played the game
Never realize that there's a flame
People livin' in a shack at the crossroads
Little kids sellin' crack at the crossroads
Let me stab you in the back at the crossroads
Everybody's gettin' jacked walkin' on the crossroads
People livin' in a shack at the crossroads
Little kids sellin' crack at the crossroads
Let me stab you in the back at the crossroads
Everybody's gettin' jacked at the crossroads
People livin' in a shack at the crossroads
Little kids sellin' crack at the crossroads
Let me stab you in the back at the crossroads
Everybody's gettin' jacked you're walkin' on the crossroads
People livin' in a shack at the crossroads
Little kids sellin' crack at the crossroads
Let me stab you in the back at the crossroads
Everybody's gettin' jacked at the crossroads
