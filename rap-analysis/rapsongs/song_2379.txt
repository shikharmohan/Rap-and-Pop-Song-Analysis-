The days are cold livin' without you
The nights are long, I'm growing older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone but you're never over
If Proof could see me now, I know he'd be proud
Somewhere in me deep down, there's something in me he found
That made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now
You try, it'll be them doors, Andre's phantom believe me clowns
That means suicide, homie, you'll never throw me
Off of this course, blow me
Bitch, I do this all for the sport only
But I want it all, I'm not just talking awards, homie
And the balls in my court and it's lonely
On top of the world when you're the only
One with the balls and your shorts
To leave them jaws on the floor with no remorse
Remember that when they get to doggin' your boy homie
So y'all can just get to bloggin' about Bologna
I'm not gonna stop the saga
Continue, no stoppin' the force Obi, I'm moppin the floors
With them, I keep tryna pass it, but they keep on droppin' the torch
And it won't be, long 'til this sport is O V
E R, just blazin' and we are knockin' them doors and no we
Ain't pumpkins on Halloween but we'll show up on your porch so be
Careful what you say, there ain't no punks over here so follow me
Through the fog like I'm S N double O P
Let me guide you through the smoke G
If only I wasn't travellin' down this road by my lonely
No one who knew me like you will ever know me
I don't think you understand how much you meant to me
The days are cold livin' without you
The nights are long, I'm growing older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone but you're never over
And it don't stop, oh
And it don't quit, oh
And it don't stop, oh
And it don't quit, oh
And I miss you, oh
I just miss you, oh
I just miss you, oh
Homie, I'll never forget you, no
For you, I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life
So sick it'll blow up the mic, it'll put the dyna in mite
Yeah, it'll make the dopest MC wanna jump off a bridge and shit himself
Tap dancin' all over the beat, it'll jump off the page and spit itself
Yes, it's the best thing I could do right now Doodi for you is to rap
So I'mma fuck 'til I die, yeah, I'mma do it to death
And instead of mourning your death, I'd rather celebrate your life
Elevate to new height, step on the gas and accelerate
I'mma need two mics
'Cuz the way that I'm feelin' tonight, everything I can just do right
There's nothing that I can do wrong
I'm too strong and I'm just too hyped
Just finished the rhyming bust it, excuse the corny metaphor
But they'll never catch up to all this energy that I've mustered
So God just help me out while I fight through this grievin' process
Tryna process this loss is makin' me nauseous
But this depression ain't takin' me hostage
I've been patiently watchin' this game, pacin' these hallways
You had faith in me always
Proof you knew I'd come out of this slump, rise from these ashes
Come right back on they asses and go Mike Tyson on these bastards
And Imma show 'em, blow 'em out the water slaughter 'em homes
I'm on so many bells the only place they can hit me is below
Homie, I know I'm never gonna be the same with you
I never woulda came in this game, I'm going insane without you
Matter of fact it was just the other night, had another dream about you
You told me to get up, I got up I spread my wings and I flew
You gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you
You told me, nah, Doodi you're not layin' on that table I knew
I was gonna make it, soon as you said think of Hailie I knew
There wasn't no way that I was gonna ever leave them babies, and Proof
Not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you
Lord I'm so thankful, please don't think that I don't feel grateful, I do
Just grant me the strength that I need for one more day to get through
So homie this is your song, I dedicate this to you
I love you Doodi
The days are cold livin' without you
The nights are long, I'm growing older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone but you're never over
And it don't stop, oh
And it don't quit, oh
And it don't stop, oh
And it don't quit, oh
And I miss you, oh
I just miss you, oh
I just miss you, oh
Homie, I'll never forget you, no
