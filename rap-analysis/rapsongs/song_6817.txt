Come on man, Eastsidaz, East side
Infamous Mobb, Infamous Mobb Deep
Out the muthafuckin' depths in New York, it's P
You couldn't get close enough to even touch the kid
If you did, you wouldn't get far enough to bag
I put my guns to work on your bitch ass
Hold up, niggas fuckin' up the game
Put my name in statements, cooperating wit these and talkin'
Fuck it, I'll still buck 'em and gamble wit my freedom
These niggas gon' learn to respect the P-Dub
I don't take no shit off nobody
No nigga, no bitch, let's get rich and party
Let's not test my gangsta, that's how you get bodied
That's how hearts get took, pride get damaged
Lives is shedded, fuckin' wit these East side niggas
We teach y'all niggas 'bout this murder shit
We got Tray Deee, Goldie Loc, Hav and P
Kokane, wit my nigga Snoop D O G G
Big hitters, wig splitters, give niggas the blues
Fools loud mouth we all about spittin' them tools
From the coast of the locs were the G's was born
And we raise up B.G.'s to keep it goin'
In the alleys, not the valleys, killa Cali the zone
Long Beach bringin' heat, takin' off when it's on
Fuck pretty, come gritty when we bring the noise
Big boys play wit keeps when we bring the toys
Wet T-shirts, we search to put in work 'cuz
Come back for ya homies as you gettin' ya dirt dug
Congregatin', operatin' G's and hustlas
You other muthafuckas can't conceive our structures
The DPGC, the M O B B
Strictly East side and we ride on G.P.
Bandannas, hoodies, timbos and chucks
Stay mashin' on bustas, not givin' a fuck
Eastsidaz and Mobb Deep, we connected
From the West to the East, connected
Oh, what you got beef? Connected
Run up on ya while ya sleep, stay connected
My nephews play wit keeps, we connected
From the West to the East, connected
Blast ya ass in the streets, we connected
Eastsidaz & Mobb Deep, stay connected for life, for life
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Connect wit my dogs, be that serious shit
Serious things when M O B and Sidaz bang
Ice and chains, be best that you hide those thangs
And pressure to that ass, we apply those thangs
Told you fucks before, when it rains it pours
It's a cold, cold, cold world nigga it's Doggy Dogg
Better walk or crawl, for real 'cause on the real homeboy
Fuck around and you'll be up in the morgue
Moms praisin' the lords, rev paintin' the picture
Of a wise young man who didn't get the picture
We keep it gangsta nigga, don't get it twisted nigga
Cross me nigga, you'll wind up a missin' nigga
QB and we truly, rep for ours
Wars and scars, bitches in a gang of whips
When it came to this game though we changed the shit
And fuck who you wit, it's what you up in the club but yo
Uzi's, AK's, Glock 40's and Tech 9's
Tryna take mines, you'll be a dead muthafucka
Come up short, wit yo life on support
Burnin' rubber down the street in a black super spoke
Fo' pokes to the neck, five sticks to the dome
Gun powder on my clothes when I smacked him in his nose
Real talk, show you how to walk the walk
All black all times when I scheme and stalk
It's somethin' about bein' a cold blooded killa
I'm bananas my nigga, like a black ass guerrilla
I'm G'd up, smokin' all the muthafuckin' weed up
Drinkin' on a full cup nigga
Eastsidaz and Mobb Deep, we connected
From the West to the East, connected
Oh, what you got beef? Connected
Run up on ya while ya sleep, stay connected
My nephews play wit keeps, we connected
From the bridge to the beach, connected
Run up on ya while ya sleep, stay connected
Eastsidaz & Mobb Deep, stay connected for life, for life
Yeah, definitely connected, how you love that?
Uh, like I said, you can't spell the West without the ES
East side up Eastsidaz, from QB to the LB
You see what I see and G how I G
Feel me? Eastsidaz, 'Duces 'N Trayz'
The old fashioned way, Alchemist, uh, yeah, yeah
