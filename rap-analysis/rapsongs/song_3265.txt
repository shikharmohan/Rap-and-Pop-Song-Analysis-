Yo shut up, this is Ice muthafuckin' T
And I've been listenin' to a lotta DJ's
Get on the mike and tryin' to get busy
You know what I'm sayin'?
But can't no DJ get rap like my muthafuckin' nigga Evil E
So right about now I'ma give him the muthafuckin' microphone
I'ma get behind the wheels and we gon' do this
Yo, Evil tell where the fuck it's comin' from
It's comin' from the mouth of the pimp behind the wheels
I make a bitch kneel, Evil E the gray steel
Shows, ho's, junior pimp sweat out, punk
So I can give your bitch the Evil E jump
I love you honey, sure, listen up, listen clear
After the show, yo ho' hit the rear
Backstage pass, lick stick tied on the right tit
My hopes of gettin' licked, grab that ass and then hit
Hit, hard movin' wall security will be knockin'
While Evil E's rockin', charlie jam and try blockin'
I'm a fuckin' mack that comes up by playin' the back
Ask my nigga, I'll be shony shony shony mack
  (But the record says the yellow niggas gettin' loose)
Yo E, tell him who the fuck you are
Yeah nigga, I'm the pimp behind the wheels
  (But the record says the yellow niggas gettin' loose)
Yo man, I don't think they no heard you, man
I don't think the fuck they heard you
Hey bitch, I'm the pimp behind the wheels
  (But the record says the yellow niggas gettin' loose)
You're the pimp behind the wheels, right
The pimp behind the wheels
That's right, I'm the pimp behind the wheels
  (But the record says the yellow niggas gettin' loose)
Yo, jump off
Yo, check this muthafuckin' shit out
Standin' here and no quitter, a fuckin' babysitter
Quickly get with her, ahead bitches, that's bitter
I'm all that, fuck you, if you don't think so
Take your moms, make that bitch my main ho'
Let's go, let's go, let's go, show time
Below the cynical side where my nigga kicked the dope rhyme
That ass, yup, that's what I'm pimpin'
Niggas never sleep and Evil E, I get deep in some ass
Make you fatal, yo, that's pimpin'
New city, new titty, Evil E never be simpin'
Down with the cynic and rippin' shit up at will
My yellow nigga Ice and I'm the pimp behind the wheels
  (But the record says the yellow niggas gettin' loose)
Yo, jump off E, get busy dude
That's right I'm the pimp behind the wheels
  (But the record says the yellow niggas gettin' loose)
I don't think they hear you, nigga
I don't think they hear you
Yeah nigga, I'm the pimp behind the wheels
  (But the record says the yellow niggas gettin' loose)
Muthafuckin' pimp behind the wheels, yeah
That's right I'm the pimp behind the wheels
  (But the record says the yellow niggas gettin' loose)
Yo Ice, break it down like this
Yeah nigga
Yo P, cut that shit up properly
Now, I never seen a MC cut shit up right
A muh'fuckin' nigga but check this shit out
Evil E, the nigga that always gives a fuck
About gettin' some glock and crazy bust
If I can find hazels, all it takes is a second
Cynical weapon Evil E and I'm kept in the back
Where I supply the sounds on stage
Cops in the race that's why we're always on the front page
Rippin' shit up, me and my yellow nigga
The mike is the gat and the wheels is the trigger
Grab a haze, knowin' every city that I rip
Got crazy dollars 'cause I always keep a grip
Get down with the cynic and rippin shit up at will
My yellow nigga Ice
And who are you? And I'm the pimp behind the wheels
  (But the record says the yellow niggas gettin' loose)
Niggas don't know, man, nigga's don't know
Yeah nigga, I'm the pimp behind the wheels
  (But the record says the yellow niggas gettin' loose)
Niggas can't hear you, muthafucker
Yeah, I'm the pimp behind the wheels
  (But the record says the yellow niggas gettin' loose)
Niggas don't understand the level of this game
Ice is down with the pimp behind the wheels
  (But the record says the yellow niggas gettin' loose)
Niggas, niggas, can't deal with this shit
 [Incomprehensible] with the pimp behind the wheels
  (But the record says the yellow niggas gettin' loose)
LP's with the pimp behind the wheels
  (But the record says the yellow niggas gettin' loose)
Bodycount's with the pimp behind the wheels
  (But the record says the yellow niggas gettin' loose)
The cynic is with the pimp behind the wheels
  (But the record says the yellow niggas gettin' loose)
Ten G's with the pimp behind the wheels
Pimp behind the wheels, yeah
That's right muthafucker, 1993 style home invasion
Dedicatin' this shit to all the DJ's in the muthafuckin' world
And peace to all MC's in the world
My nigga Ice on the wheels of steel
You know what I'm sayin'?
To all that haze goes out with, nationwide
You know what I'm sayin'? I'm the maddest muthafucker
Shit's gonna fly, and shit Evil E style
All the virgins, thanks for nothin'
The pimp behind the wheels
Know 'bout this DJ' in here, E
Yeah, as for all the DJ's out there
Y'all can suck my dick too, twice
Yeah, I'm dedicatin' this record
To all the DJ's in this entire muthafuckin' world
It's down with the Evil E and my yellow nigga
That's me, ho'
Peace to all the MC's in the house
And peace to all the haze nose all over the world
Yo E, I think I'm gettin' a seminar in the DJ competition
Evil E is the fuck outta here
The great Evil E, Evil, Evil E, I'm nice
