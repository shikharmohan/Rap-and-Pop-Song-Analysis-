Here
The E R I C K  S E R M O N
I'm dark skinned, pack a mac 10 more menace
And I'll wreck the whole damn set
Smash, you ain't seen shit yet
Yes, a fact, a black nine mil is what I pack
In the front of my waist, right next to my bozack
A safety for the suckers that hate me
I haven't had to bust a couple of rounds lately
I hope not, it's no fun getting shot
'Cause when I cock, I aim straight for the knot
I don't miss, I have a scope, no jokin'
You should hope that disco appearance like broke
Mass destruction when I start crushin' and bustin'
Duck MC's, I'm bumrushin'
Swift wit the trig, there's nuff foes equipped
Real deal, of course, I pack steel, shits thick
I'm not dumb, to walk the streets, they kept us swinging by
A punk chump wit spunk, who dares to jump
By the hour, I push power like Hiroshima
Got dropped on by U.S.A. and like cleaned her
I manage to damage people without a sequel
This is for my people
Check out the main attraction, black man in action
Number one crowd mover, I break backs in
Boy, you shoulda known what EPMD stands for
Sucker snappin' necks, bustin' caps and breakin' jaws
It's Erick and Parrish Making Dollars
Excel, living well, taking no shorts and why bother
To whine while I dine, sounds genuine
You walked in the wrong camp, punk, stepped on a land mine
Boom bang, bust the slang that I bring
From Brent wood, Long Island, all the way to Sing-Sing
Yes the penile, peace to brothers on trial
For some bullshit charge, mugshot on file
For hard time, thump beats like an Alpine
No Sam Suey sole shoe shoot joints, back a Tech Nine
Yes the brother's back with no knife or axe
Just a microphone, sucker, it limits that pack
Def blows and flows, quadraverbs and echoes
Sounds the pound hard to make an MC petrol
My nine mil, kitted wit the infrared beam
Something similar to a Roger Moore scene
That's James Bond, 007, with guillotine
To keep the Hit Squad hype to fly heads like the A-Team
Don't bug or miss, bug on the sequel
For this shit I kick, it's strictly for my people
