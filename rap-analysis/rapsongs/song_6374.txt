Circumstances are like my first fight I lost it was swinging my arms Bugging, adrenaline pumping, oh shit, this little nigga's thuggin', I mean
I was thirteen, I was nursing a knot on my face
But chose another time and a place
That I would avenge my last fight 'cuz the same shit
Ain't gonna happen that just happen last night
Knuckle game changed quicker than lighting
Hit 'em or slice 'em, either stick 'em or blast pipes, it's the fast life
I tried to give another nigga' advice, shoot dice
Do plenty of shit, 'cuz this life, how many you get?
How many niggas do you know get two
Besides a nigga who snitch to skip a life bid, be one in your crew
I don't respect killers, I respect O.G. knowledge
Codes of the streets got new rules, but no guidance
Lessons, catch detremental to a young disciple
Focus, take care of your brothers, niggas, do as I do
Keep your enemies close, where they can see you
It's not your enemy who get's you, it's always your own people
It's always your own people, it's always your own people
It's always your own people, it's always your own people
Mass confusion, in my head, killin' me, drivin' me mad
Got me wonderin', can I trust my friends
'Cause they stick me in my back every chance they get
Am I paranoid? And if that's the case
Is it curable? Can you help me find my place?
I can't handle this, I'm losin' it
With a loose grip, I'm hangin' on to emptiness
Help your brother, save him from the evil demons
In between us, came between us
I know you hate me, don't you?
I bet you sittin', wish my time never came
You probably rather see me die in the game
You probably rather see me die in a plane
Well, ya'll see me up on top of my dough, I get my money shit changed
And niggas, start looking at me different than this
I'm down to play the real nigga shit to get with a bitch
But, I'ma tell a motherfucker like this
You only good as what you come up against, nigga
You get what you get
So, the grass is greener on the other side of the fence
But any attempts and you gonna need the guy in the trench
I'ma starter while you ridin' the bench
You sayin' you a playa, well I'm the one designin' your prints
Somethin' to go by, to let these niggas know
I don't believe in lettin' shit slide, nigga gonna die
Best friends since high school seniors
Where the homeboys is meaner, but let the bullshit come between us
Mass confusion, in my head, killin' me, drivin' me mad
Got me wonderin', can I trust my friends
'Cause they stick me in my back every chance they get
Am I paranoid? And if that's the case
Is it curable? Can you help me find my place?
I can't handle this, I'm losin' It
With a loose grip, I'm hangin' on to emptiness
Help your brother, save him from the evil demons
In between us, came between us
