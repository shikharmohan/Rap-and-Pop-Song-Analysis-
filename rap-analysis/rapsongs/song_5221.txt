Meth-Tical hit 'em with the stimultaion
I got 36 styles on my mind
Keep it real, Shaolin represent one (time)
All my peoples are you with me, where you at? (suuuu)
All my killer bees on attack, where you at? (suuuu)
Throw ya fuckin' hands in the air if you wanna mix
If ya got ya gats peel a cap for the new year
Blinding devotion
What's the commotion?
Wu-Tang clan (?)
Flowin' like the ocean (bluue)
I be comin' for your (crewww)
Flyin' guillotine (styyyle)
With the name Meth-Tical
Is it on?

Brothers want the drama but don't know how to act
Until the chrome pointed at his dome head crack
C'mon let's keep it real, no disguise, recognize
From my sword chop what a nigga do?
A nigga dies
That's why I'm stressin' that brothers keep they thoughts on they lesson
Ressurect yo mind from the essence
For real

Now I'm chillin' with the neighborhood villans thug life it be on now
Hear the gun blaow as I milk another cow
Let the method show you how niggas do it
I study
In the life of good, bad, and ugly
Part time call that nigga lovely
But that ain't nuttin'
Before I die, I'm a leave the world
With something
To remember me by
The real stimuli
Fool you be frontin'
?Ass out rap to rapture to capture?
I keep it when I part like a natural disaster
I keep it live
Time more than '85
And (?) third eye got me thinkin'

Then you got it now
