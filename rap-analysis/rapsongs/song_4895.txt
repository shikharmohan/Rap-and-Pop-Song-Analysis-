I can't live with you (cant live without you)
I can't live with you (cant live without you)
I can't live with you (cant live without you)
I can't live with you (cant live without you)
[Ludacris:] 
One day I love you, the next I can't stand you.
It's to much for me to handle.
I made my mind up thinkin' Im on the right track.
So then I leave you, but then come right back.
And I don't like that, I swear Im so confused.
Don't know what I want or what's the right thing to do.
But the right thing is you, you're my destiny.
Even at my worst you're still bringin' out the best in me.
But then you testin' me, know how to push my buttons.
Fussin', Fightin', yeah we always gettin' into somethin.
So mad I make you cry, then we make love.
A never ending cycle, make up to break up.
It's time to wake up, I need to smell the coffee.
Play with these other women, or get em all off me.
And you wonder why your mad don't just doubt you.
Can't live with ya, can't live without ya.
[Monica:]
I can't live with you (cant live without you)
I can't live with you (cant live without you)
I can't live with you (cant live without you)
The one thing that I know, is I can't seem to let you go.
You got me to the point I'm walking out the door.
And then I find myself coming back for more.
I don't know what to do.
Cause I can't live with you  and cant live without you.
[Ludacris:]
One day I love you, the next I can't stand you.
It's to much for me to handle.
One minute naggin' me, always harassing me.
Next minute squeezin' me, huggin' me, kissin' and grabbin' me.
Just when I think its cool, you back startin' shit.
Finding the smallest things just to start an argument. 
Goin' through my phone.
Know you shouldnt've took it though!
I hope your stupid ass finds what your lookin' for.
Stormin' out the house, mad, throwin' breakin' shit.
Callin' your girls exaggerating and fakin' shit.
Packin' clothes like you really bout to leave this time.
Know you messed up but actin' like its me this time.
This is a revolving door that keeps spinnin' round.
Are we gon' be together? Or are we finished now?
And you wonder why your man don't just doubt you.
Can't live with ya, can't live without ya.

[Monica:]
Where the going gets tough and the fighting be rough
Most of them folks can't call it good but I guess we call it love
I'll be asking for your touch and I don't give you my trust
First I hate you with a passion then I can't need you enough.
I'll be.. want to spend my whole live with you
Then I'll be.. Talking about how you and me are through
And my mind says yes, but my heart says no,
And my mind says walk, but my feet won't go away.
See I'll be telling you to go, but deep inside I want you to stay.
You know how to make me smile, but at times you ruin my day.
We got to get better, got to get it together
And you wonder why your girl don't just doubt you
I can't live with ya I can't live without you.
