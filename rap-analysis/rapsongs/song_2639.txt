Yeah, I know it's been a long time since y'all heard my voice
Maybe what, 2, 3, years or somethin'
Been up and down, been high and low
Even been at the point of no return, but no hope
Just want to let my fans know that I'm still here
Y'all holla back
The sound was broken, too many years being political
It's kinda hard to do when everything your seein' is critical
It's all my fault what they said in the news
But it's funny, how the public seems to get it confused
They act like they ain't got nothin' better to do
All they want is a statement, the hatin' is blatin'
But we never paid attention to those who hate us
'Til my face was on the cover of all the local papers
But still un-phased, I kept my cool
Plottin', carefully, every step I choose
And my, cool-whit poin, and my write finery
Everybody wanna know my side of the story
Well here it is, the whole truth, plain and simple
This'll finally explain, all the pain I've been through
And in no way shape or form of my provoken violence
Please try to understand my broken silence
See black, everybody is on my back
See black, everybody is on my back
