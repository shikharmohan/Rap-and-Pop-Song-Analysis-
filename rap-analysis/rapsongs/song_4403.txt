Yea, {indistinct} That's more like it
Uh...... Uh...... Uh......
Chea, This that rock with me music, Buck with me music, 
Baby come to my pad and fuck with me music,
Follow with me music, follow with me lose your life,
I would like to prove it, but now that I got gooning,
Ever since this new hit, I've been on that bullshit,
You know like the fireplace, that how hot it would get,
So Santa come your ass down the chimney, 
Behind my kids I need your gift bag empty, 
Riff wrap plenty, yea that we all do, 
I have two tech nines should I text or call you, 
Mutha fucker I kill all you 
Put the pump to ya ear and pump up the volume, 
Knock out a tall dude, bear hug a fat boy, 
I fuck the teacher, and stomp on a frat boy, 
I don't believe in preachers and I've never been a choir boy, 
but my pockets do hit high notes like Mariah boy, 
Yea, I keep my angel on like maya boy, 
Then I pull it out and give you wings watch me fly a boy, 
Used to be a high boy now I'm on fire boy, 
I mean fire, like rubbing cardorouy, 
Oops, I meant courdarouy, carter boy, 
Stunting like my father boy, flow like water boy, 
Even though I have a voice like Debroy, I'm a water boy, 
Vacate a term like my first name was walter boy, 
Sweetness, but see you rather salt a boy, 
But I put that pep in your step like walter boy, 
Church, and Weezy F's the alterboy, 
And yes I am a Dog, now watch me Catapault a boy.
