Call it Puppy Love Curtis and Tisha in the tree

She was pregnant by me once, glad she didn't have it
'Cause I be paying child support now, goddamn it
Tish was my bitch, till she fucked my god-brother
I was heated when I heard, wanted to go upside his head
It was Christmas, I just bought the bitch a sheepskin kid
I was sick to my stomach, nigga, this is real shit
I ain't the sensitive type, I ain't sit around crying
I caught the bitch on the avenue and punched her in the eye
Call it Puppy Love Curtis and Janelle in the tree

D's came locked my ass up like a savage
Then came Doobie in the baby carriage
Imagine how it felt summer day pretty blue skies
I gazed memorized at her in with green eyes
I'm so into you baby, we don't even got touch
That the type shit I say when I really want to fuck
'Cause her cousin Tisha lived by baby [unverified] forty
Sold crack before rap so everybody know me
Chase Jus down cut his head the motherfucker owe me
Vick's spinning, Cheek's was the hottest rapper in the hood
I ain't hate but on the low I didn't think he was good
We wore timberland boots, carhartt suits
You can tell a nigga paid when his filas shoes suede
Ock a Ceaser or a fade kept a pistol or a blade
Try to flip a 62 like every couple days
I get knocked I come home its all a part of the game
Catch a snitch, cut a snitch or put one in his frame
Its like every other summer I was back and forth to jail
Telling nanna I'm copping out, so I don't need bail
Just the convesary, put the money orders in the mail
Call it Puppy Love Curtis and Deawn in the tree
K I S S I N G
Call it puppy love, call it puppy love
She came to see me on the alley, wrote me letters all the time
And I responded to the letters so she stayed on my mind
Told myself I'ma grind
As soon as I get out that paper what I'm about
After four months home I had the Lan I shine
Two months later I copped the Benz my nine
Stay all cocked even when it hot, TAZ out
TNT on the block, make yourself get knocked
I just love em and leave 'em, I don't give a fuck
I mean she didn't give a fuck, she had a nigga in my truck
Call it Puppy Love Curtis and Shaniqua in the tree
