Bone Thugs-N-Harmony
Ayo, we ain't always been accepted like this
'Til a *** got that Grammy, open the door
  (Listen to the wind blow)
Bone Thugs got a story that's similar to Mike Jones
You can ask my homies
I remember back in the days when they didn't want me
Now I blew up, they all on me
Their smile's phony
It's hard to determine who really is, which of these *** is fake
They try to eat outta ya plate and you can't get a break
Now how much can you take for heaven's sakes?
I can't wait they got me listenin' to the wind blow
Sittin' back, rollin' up my ***
Rollin' with my *** finger hangin' out the window
Let's roll, get yo' *** hand out my pocket
Now they wanna be a *** friend like we partners
*** we was lookin' for a deal and you dodged us
Never did call us, what was your problem?
Rollin' now, we ridin' by, listen to the wind blow
*** tell the real from the fake when it comes from the streets
Livin' peace like a beat, like a drum from the ghetto
Give us our peace, won't let it go, said we wouldn't make it now
We some of the greatest bumpin' through your trunks
And your radio, radio
And if you don't love me now, you will never love me again
I can still hear you sayin', you must never break the chain
And if you don't love me now, you will never love me again
I can still hear you sayin', you must never break the chain
Four true thugs from the double ***
A *** ready to rumble when the trouble knocks
Took one way tickets straight off the block
We gon' make the pay, y'all *** just watch
'All Eyez On Me' like my name was Pac
*** hip-hop cop, got a plastic ***
I'm takin' drastic shots 'till these *** stop
When the casket drop I be mashin' out
In a brand new drop top flyin' ***, listenin' to the wind blow
***  automatic weapon
When they step up *** hit with a ***
Everybody tryna get a *** with a blessin'
They better not mess with mine 'cause I'm tellin'
All you *** from the beginnin'
That ain't no pretendin', conversate you gon' get it
You betta listen, listen to the wind blow
If you get it take it to the fullest just for Ish
Just do it, do it, grab the game, do it to it, to it
Chasin' chains, but still hood, live it, I love it
Diamonds in the rough don't come by to my hood
And if you don't love me now, you will never love me again
I can still hear you sayin', you must never break the chain
And if you don't love me now, you will never love me again
I can still hear you sayin', you must never break the chain
Flow like the wind blow
Never see me 'cause I get ghost, so a *** never get close
I go fast or slow, no matter the tempo
*** the instrumental, *** the rhythm
I ride to the rhythm of ***
This lyrical venom I serve up gon' *** admittable murda
*** burn some, stick with Granddad and stack cash
*** you better learn some
We got the hood hot locked, even got the birds bumpin'
Everybody tryna get in, don't nobody wanna be left in the wind
*** better not try to miss the boat
The early bird get the worm, took the game by the throat
And squeezed till the *** broke
Believe, it's *** we wrote
It's *** that we serve on the curve to the booth
These *** gon' feel it 'cause we spit the truth
Ain't never no fakin', that Grammy to prove
Haters just hatin', we do what we do
Let 'em we talk 'till we blue in the face
Only because we blew up in they face
If Bone was hurtin', if that was the case
I'd probably go loco and catch me a case
*** just move and give me some space
When I let the wind blow in my face
*** don't quit 'till I finish the race
Number one in the place, betta make no mistake
And if you don't love me now, you will never love me again
I can still hear you sayin', you must never break the chain
And if you don't love me now, you will never love me again
I can still hear you sayin', you must never break the chain
And now we ridin' by
And now we ridin' by
Now we ridin' by
Now we ridin' by
