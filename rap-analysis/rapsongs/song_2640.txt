Verse 1 [Foxy]:
Hip-hop...Brooklyn...Damn the rap game and change/ Everytime I turn around niggas spit niggas names/ 96 was when the love was real/ When Big came and took the whole Brooklyn to fame/ Straight off of St. James, lookin' all dapper don you threw a party and bullshit it was on/ B.I.G's spot would never be claimed/ 'Cause Ms. Wallace, Cease, and Roc be carryin' ya name/ And later on 96 when Hovi came and ain't no nigga was a key to his fame/ Introducin' a little Brooklyn girl by the name of Fox Brown/ About to shut this whole rap shit down/ And to the world we was Bonnie & Clyde and everything my nigga Jay said I'm ready to ride/ Then I became the sky rocket of fame and 2 million sales later bet I rode the same
(Chorus: echoed Notorious B.I.G sample & scratches)
Verse 2 [Foxy]:
Damn the rap game and change...Then Nas came and the Firm was born/ We snatched AZ, Omega, and our team was born/ I took 'em on Puff tour turn around Nas gone/ And the whole crew followed what a hard pill to swallow/ I had to thug it out and blow in the zone/ Rock 30-thousand on my motherfuckin' own/ But I couldn't break down I couldn't moan I got this Ill Na Na blood in my veins I spark alone/ 4 weeks later Puff ended it home at The Garden the show I came up on the throne/ See I can't believe my niggas left me alone/ And I don't buy that shit about Puff was treatin' me wrong/ How the fuck you tryin' to pull weight on this man tour/ At the time Puff 8-mil what the fuck you mad for?/ That's the problem with niggas see they worse than broads/ On a bitch to conceal their scars
(Chorus)
Verse 3 [Foxy]:
It's called the vapors soon as you stack some paper these cowards got the nerve to face ya/ They got the gull to page ya/ How the fuck you have a little soldier replace her with a doe-gier/ But like I told ya Fox is a trooper/ I walks straight past ya like I never fuckin' knew ya/ Listen man I'm the first bitch to sign to Def Jam/ How can't I be the best I'm from the best man/ 97 was the year Kim came with the best plan to go straight at a best friend/ I thought it was a cute little spar till I heard her on the Flex tape describin' my car/ Mo money mo problems kid I guess you never did expect me to blow this big/ I know my fans won the battle I fought but understand I keep her breathin' I'm her life support
(Chorus)
