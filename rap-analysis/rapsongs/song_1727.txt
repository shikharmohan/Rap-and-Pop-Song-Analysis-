Been all around the world
Been all around the world
All around the world, same song
All, all around the world, same song
All around the world, same song
All, all around the world, same song
I came for the party to get naughty, get my rocks on
Eat popcorn, watch you move your body to the pop song
That I'm singin', ding a lingin', funky beats ringin'
Everybody's swingin' in the place
As I kick the J an' easy is my style
R&B; mixin' it with the hip hop swing beat
Champagne in my hand, it won't be long 'til I'm gone
It's just the same old song
It's just a freestyle, meanwhile, we keep the beat kickin'
Sweat drippin', girlies in the limo, eatin' chicken
Oops, don't get the grease on your pantyhose
I love ya Rover, move over, I gotta blow my nose
Sneezin' but still I'm pleasin' to all the slimmies
Pull out my jimmie, time to get busy wit a jenny
If it's good an' plenty, don't you know?
There I go, there I go, there I go
But I don't go nowhere without my Jim hat
If I'm rappin' 'cause she's clappin'
Then I'm strappin' 'cause I'm smarter than that
Then girlie, maybe we can get along
Cutie after cutie, it's just the same old song
All around the world, same song
All, all around the world, same song
All around the world, same song
All, all around the world, same song
Money B, the freaky deaky, the squeaky meaky, up an' down
Well, as a matter of fact, I'll be right back, I gotta take a leaky
So I'm drainin', entertainin' but I got fame
An' the bases I touch, too much for me tryin' to be namin'
Aiyo, you saw me on cable an' grin
I busted in an' I was goin' to win
A Clark Gable back in Pakland, it's the same old song
Sport these shorties, same freckles an' hat
Drinkin' the same 40's
Hypothetical, political, lyrical, miracle whip
Just like butter, my rhymes are legit
'Cause I'm the Humpty, not Humpty Dumpty but Humpty Hump
Here a hump, there a hump, everywhere a hump
Shut up an' just listen, not dissin', don't get me wrong
But to me, it's just the same old song
So just watch, my name is Shock an' I like to rock
An' you can't stop this, 2Pac, go ahead an' rock this
Now I clown around when I hang around with the Underground
Girls use to frown, say I'm down when I come around
Gas me an' when they pass me, they use to diss me
Harrass me but now they ask me if they can kiss me
Get some fame, people change, wanna live they life high
Same song, can't go wrong, if I play the nice guy
Claimin' that they must have changed now that we came strong
I remain still the same, why Tu'? 'Cause it's the same song
All around the world, same song
All, all around the world, same song
All around the world, same song
All, all around the world, same song
All around the world, same song
All, all around the world, same song
All around the world, same song
All, all around the world, same song
Same song, same song, same song, same song
Same song, same song, same song, same song
