Still, kill
Still, kill
Back up in your ass with the resurrection
Is the group harder than an erection
That shows more affection
They wanna ban us on Capitol hill
'Cause it's die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas
All along it was the Geto, nothin' but the Geto
Takin' short steps one foot at a time and keep my head low
And never let go
'Cause if I let go, then I'll be spineless
I'm goin' insane
I think my mind just goes outta control
And judge your subjects muthafuckas read about
I touch on the shit that they be leavin' out
I seen this muthafucka's 9 smokin'
I seen the same nigga with the 9 die with his eyes open
And simply what this means is
He didn't know that every dog had his day
Until' he seen his
I bet you muthafuckas will too
Because it's die muthafucka, die muthafucka still fool
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still fool
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still fool
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still fool
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still fool
  (I-I-I think it's somethin' in the water man, it's just
Gotta be in the air)
Ahh fuck, chuck's on a killin' spree again
With guillotines for men
I walk around town with a frown on my face
Fuck the whole world, gonna catch a murder case
The murder rate
May increase if your caught up in the world
While it's dyin', I guarentee you're fryin' 'cause I am
On the verge of knockin' muthafuckas out for no reason
Once I get down there'll be no breathin' it seems when
Muthafuckas wanna calm down, put his palm down
Seems I gots to lay the law down
Now it's on pow what you wanna do? I'm askin' you
Step to face I'll break your ass in two, bastard you
Rather swim in some fuckin' hot tar
Before you fuck with Willie D 'cause what I got for
Your ass will make you shit your meal
'Cause it's die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still fool
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still fool
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still fool
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still fool
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still
How many niggas brought they irons tonight?
(Tell me)
How many niggas wanna ride tonight?
(I do)
Pick out our victims when the time is right
We get they ass up off the corner 'cause they dyin' tonight
Niggas be all up in my mug
But it's a different story when them muthafuckas coughin' up blood
(When he died, lookin' in his eyes, was he as he cried?)
I bust another cap in his ass and he died, time is 5
Niggas be shootin' the gift like they for real
But when it jumps, they ain't got no murder skills
So Bill just, chops 'em down, watch 'em fall
And cut their ass head to toe, jaw to jaw
But I'm-a make your bitch ass holla
'Cause I'm-a put a hole in your head
The size of a half a dolla
(Fuck around and get your cap peeled 'cause this is)
Die muthafucka, die muthafucka, kill
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still fool
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still fool
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still fool
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still fool
Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas still
