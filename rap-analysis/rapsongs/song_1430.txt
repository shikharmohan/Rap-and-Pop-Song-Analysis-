That's right, I'm dancin' y'all
I'm gon' keep on dancin' into the new millennium
Ya understand what I'm sayin'?
Hey, De La Soul, Beastie Boys, I love the way y'all doin' this baby
Y'all just gotta keep kickin' it
Because the kids don't know, the other people don't know
But they all gon' know now because me the Chief Rocker Busy Bee
Gon' just keep kickin' flava baby, ah like this
Just dance, and don't quit
'Cause the music is gonna be the shit
I just dance, and don't quit
'Cause the music is gonna be the shit
And now once upon a time in the place to be
They was standin' in line to see the Busy Bee
When I pulled up to the curb in my ninety-eight
I rushed inside so I won't be late
You know the party was packed
Where you couldn't even move
And Busy Bee rocked
To the funky funky grooves
To the beat that makes you want to freak
Ah, to the beat that gets rump out your seat
Ah, to the beat that makes you say
Busy Bee, Busy Bee is in the house
I like the way this is goin' down man
Ah, this is just too much, we just gotta keep doin this
Because this is how we do it, no static, no automatics
This is just how we just gon' keep kickin' this flavor, baby
