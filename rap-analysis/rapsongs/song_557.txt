Dum. Da-dum, dum, da-dum, dum, dum, dum, dum. Dum, dum, da-dum, dum, da-dum, dum, dum, dum, dum.
They call me the Dummy Man [the Dummy Man ...], and I'm up early tryin?to slang my dope [I'm the nigga with the biggest rocks.]. The fiends, they get awfully mad [awfuly mad ...] when they go broke on dope, and it's really soap [My nigga you ain't never lied].
Up in the mornin' and I feel like I don't wanna be livin', better off dead 
without no bread. Have you ever felt that feelin'? Unsatisfied, feelin' like you wanna die when you reach into your pocket and can't even find not even enough to go purchase a dime sack of weed. But fuck that, I got come up in my blood, plus it's the first of the month, nigga what, the perfect time to come up. The only problem is I'm broke and ain't got no dope. But as I was standin?at my bathroom mirror, I look at the soap. Shit, soap look a little like dope. You scandalous nigga! Then I chop, chop up me some counterfeit amphetamines. But wait a minute, wait, wait a minute now, what if they want to taste it? Then quickly for cash, nigga dash to the kitchen get the bread bag. 
Wrap that bread around some soap, now I got the bread crumb dum-dum dope. It might sound funny but it ain't no joke cause doin' this shit could get a nigga smoked, man. But fuck it! Young nigga gotta get them duckets. Hit the medicine cabinet for the final touches, Orajel for the numbness. Then I hit the corner with a handful of bread crumbs, nigga got the dum-dum for ya [for ya] and I pump on approach if you say it ain't dope, only dealin' 'cause I hear that they sober. Peep, creep on a come up, I'll wait for a fiend to roll up, and walk to the car with my hand on my pistol, he showed me the greens. Said, "Hold up. Gotta get my stash." Nigga need a twenty, and I got that faded. Lovin' these yum-yum's, glad I made it, I just hope this nigga don't try to taste it. I dropped him the dummy, he said it was lovely. 
But as he pulled off I pinned that he put a rock up in his mouth [mouth], so he gon' come back for his money. I pinned that he braked, he skid, put it in reverse and he came back quick. Fiend jumped out and he talkin' all big, this is what happened to this bitch: we beat him, and finished him off and he never came 'round here no more cause the nigga ran into yours-truly. Poor, and a nigga scored. Lord forgive me but I can't remember the last time I ate. Now I gots to go get me a plate or we pin ÃÂ¦Ã¢Â¦ÃÂ¹m up proper. Only spent three dollars and forty four cent, nigga full, now I gotta get bent. Nigga still got sixteen dollars and fifty six cent, hell yeah! These dum dums got a nigga off the hook, they got booked, took, shook, look, got dope, but it ain't dope, so I guess you could call me a crooked crook. Hey, do ya know somebody like me? I don't think so, cause ain't nobody. I see down for the crime like I'm down for mine, and if I gotta, nigga, I cheat, cheat.
They call me the Dummy Man [the Dummy Man ...], and I'm up early tryin?to slang my dope [I'm the nigga with the biggest rocks.]. The fiends, they get awfully mad [awfuly mad ...] when they go broke on dope, and it's really soap [My nigga you ain't never lied].
So fuck with me, I got them chops man [choppa, choppa, choppa]. The biggest 
rocks up on the block, man [the biggest rocks up on the block man]. Say, fuck with me, I got them chops man [choppa, choppa, choppa]. The biggest rocks up on the block, man [the biggest rocks up on the block man].
