You never know a good thing till I'm gone
You be spending many, many nights
Home alone
You won't be seein' me
Around your way, no, no
And if you don't get it together
Baby, I can't stay
Don't be comin' in my face
Tryin' to tell me you love me
You shoulda thought once or twice
Sacrifice and make it right
It's the thing that you do
Make me not love you
Go this way and you'll see
Get no other love like me
You never know I'm for real until I leave
And when I pack up my clothes
Don't be callin' me
You won't be seein' me
Anymore, no, no
'Cause when I'm long, long gone
I won't be back in this door
Don't be comin' in my face
Tryin' to tell me you love me
You shoulda thought once or twice
Sacrifice and make it right
It's the thing that you do
Make me not love you
Go this way and you'll see
Get no other love like me
To my east side people, to my west side
To all my bitches who sat home cryin'
Over these niggas and over these fellows
Shake 'em off like Jello
To the east side people, to my west side
To all my bitches who sat home cryin'
Over these niggas an' over these fellows
Shake 'em off like Jello
Don't be comin' in my face
Tryin' to tell me you love me
You shoulda thought once or twice
Sacrifice and make it right
It's the thing that you do
Make me not love you
Go this way and you'll see
Get no other love like me
I used to stick closer to your side then a beeper
Till you smoked that cheaper reefer
Now you loony as fita, cheddar
Don't say a word, yep, I got tha word
Yeah, I heard it from a little bird
Now I'm out the door, my four, four
You don't know?
Get your bags and your things, take the door
Don't take this shit, no more
When you leave you can leave out the back door
Fucker
Stupid niggas
Yeah, who always think they can lay somebody
Ya'll know who ya'll are
Tryin' to run about three or four, five women at one time
Now you wanna come back all in our faces an', an'
Tellin' me, how much you love me and all that bullshit
Yeah, whatever man
Fuck you
Alright, I'm out
