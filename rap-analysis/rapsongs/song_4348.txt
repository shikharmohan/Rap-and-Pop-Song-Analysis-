I'm not sayin' this to shake you up
I'm just sayin' this to wake you up
It's all good when we makin' love
All I ask is don't take our love
For granted, it's granted
My love for you is real
If you don't love me somebody else will
Baby girl don't you ever get too comfortable
Comfortable, comfortable, comfortable
Yeah, to the left, to the left
If you wanna leave, be my guest, you can step
Feeling irreplaceable, listenin' to BeyoncÃÂ©
But okay, I'll put you out on your b'day
Hey, now if you rocking with Weezy
Bedroom in the bank, baby, we safe
I got game like E.A.
But I wanna let you play
And don't I treat you like soufflÃÂ©?
Don't I look at you like I see a new day?
And don't I do, what I do say?
I'm through talking so I'ma let you, Face

All I ask is don't take our love
For granted, it's granted
My love for you is real
If you don't love me somebody else will
So baby girl don't you ever get too comfortable
Comfortable, comfortable, comfortable
Yeah, let me catch my breath
Talking 'bout leavin' and you ain't gone yet
And if you leave, leave correct
And I'ma send a jet to pick up the next
And if you leave, you're leaving the best
So, you would have to settle for less
And I am no Elliot Ness
I don't handcuff, I don't arrest
I do confess to the murders, see
'Cause under them sheets I am a mess
Yes baby, you blessed
Now, just don't jump your nest, c'mon
I'm not sayin' this to shake you up
I'm just sayin' this to wake you up
It's all good when we makin' love
All I ask is don't take our love
For granted, it's granted
My love for you is real
If you don't love me somebody else will
Baby girl don't you ever get too comfortable
Comfortable, comfortable, comfortable
Yeah, it's no sweat, no sweat
I will never 1, 2, 3, 4 get
About you, your love, your sex
You know I work you out like Bowflex
Our jokes, no stress
Love, live life, proceed, progress
Make sure the neighbors get no rest
We can get together, never disconnect, yeah
Your back, your neck
Funny how that song haven't got old yet
To us, so let's project, you stay in
Never incorrect, Face
