Bert nasty stinking, get a cup
Get a cup, get to drinking
Pullin' up in them big red [unverified] trucks
They ask what the fuck was y'all thinking
Carolina Agents, get a flick
Get a chick, get a Days Inn
Come through with the crew
And they know we be makin' noise
They ask, "Why them boys so flagrant?"
Might wanna call ya bet off
The fix is in and y'all can't contend
With this joint we 'bout to set off
Everytime Phonte come in ya town
Throwin' it down, couple rounds get let off
In commemoration of his penetration
Through ya defense and it's a celebration
Of when everybody cheerin' for me in the Skybox
'Cuz my team break-fast like IHOP
And if you get scared, you will get served
Televised nationwide like insurance
And you too will feel a aftershock
Ten years later still be a laughing stock
'Cause we always make the play in the house
And we callin' niggaz out like graduation day
9th wonder's the editor, Pooh's the predator
But Tay is the creditor I'ma make 'em pay
(Ya know)
Bert nasty stinking, get a cup
Get a cup, get to drinking
Pullin' up in them big red [unverified] trucks
They ask what the fuck was y'all thinking
Carolina Agents, get a flick
Get a chick, get a Days Inn
Come through with the crew
And they know we be makin' noise
They ask, "Why them boys so flagrant?"
I ride with it shiznit's wicked
Mind over pretend I did it with no gimmicks
My, pro image throwback vintage
Every time you can read it in my sentence
Pray repentence, niggaz is comin' young'n
Gunning, like [unverified] and them
See Pooh gon' step back and start warying them
(Ha)
My God, my squad, go hard
Remind young Do of junkyard
We trunk y'all like Shaq with Kobe
Niggaz running, man there's only 30 sold?
You can fold if ya wanna, this lukewarm summer
Mean ball hard for the rest of the year
Got bitches back naked like it's hot in here
If you scared say you scared I can smell the fear nigga
Yo, I will not lose and if you thought
I will settle for anything less than homie
I got news to the 3rd degree
NC's in a state of emergency
(Yes, yes, get it poppin')
Kickin' the truth and just sticking to the doctrine
I'm here to tell you, failure is not an option
Streets are watchin' people plottin'
LB is in the house and we keep it poppin'
(Let 'em know)
The beats are droppin', verses ready
Big Do is in the house so checks are heavy
And C Simms is holding the camera extra steady
'Cuz when I'm on stage it's hard to stand still
The haters be like, "Give it a rest already"
I don't give a fuck 'bout how you and ya man feel
(Ya know)
Bert nasty stinking, get a cup
Get a cup, get to drinking
Pullin' up in them big red [unverified] trucks
They ask what the fuck was y'all thinking
Carolina Agents, get a flick
Get a chick, get a Days Inn
Come through with the crew
And they know we be makin' noise
They ask, "Why them boys so flagrant?"
