I see diamond flooded demons Lamborghini	angels halos down with the doors flappin  doors when they came through windows up system bumpin you the one they sang 2,sang too the same crew who said you the one you should send yo thanks 2.Pocket full of blessings they can sanctify and saint you, you can hear em revin up in heaven now cant you.sandals made of chrome soul made of leather engine made of sinnin and candy painted feathers,the sound of the motor the only revin(reverend) you confess 2,i see this all in the eyes of the girl i am next to,i ask her where we goin and she just told me pleasure,hands on the wheel and her heels on thee accelerator-rator,told her wait up,she kept goin like ect; or like a broken record,we've come to far to just wheel it back selector so we gon ride foreva...foreva and eva and eva,foreva chorus
said she was a fan of mine
knew she was new jersey, but said that she was Anaheim
butterflies turn to suicides, now its phantoms flyin
used to whisper in my ear, but now she tryna vandal mine
that holy feelin all gone, slowly feelin all wrong
none of this is satisfyin, pull it over, let me out, ill just hitch hike back to mine
nothings really as it seems, yea i shoulda known that
thought i called a angel, devils had my phones tapped
chorus
