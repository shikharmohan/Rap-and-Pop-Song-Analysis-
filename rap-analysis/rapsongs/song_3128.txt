You be the one that's takin' live rounds
You be the one that's got to run from them bloodhounds

My seven ladies still dressin' like the eighties
You be the one that just checked in emergency
You be the one that's a die in need of surgery

Supreme hustle, I got supreme muscle
I call 'em team tustle

We be the ones with the big guns
We be the ones with the six-uns

We be the ones that make you beat your wife
And hate your life
