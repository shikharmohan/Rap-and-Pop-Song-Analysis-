Yeah No Ceilings baby,
hehe,
Ok,
Swimming in Polo, sleeping in Jordan's,
Bought a cell phone and I don't even much call it
New imports make her fell important
No bull sh-t, n-gga no Ben Gordan
Get her information, take her on vacation
Give her dope d-ck, now she under the sedation
Wake her in the mornin, breakfast where she slept at
Tell her go shopping, I cant wait till she get back
Louis flip-flops and a pair of pink sweat pants
She wear that on my jet, I f-ck her after jet lag
I take her to da vet, cause she a bad bitch
You cant be broke and happy so me im mad rich
Im talkin Young Money sh-t, she love the way I think
L'Oreal all over my bathroom sink,
Betsy Johnson all over my bedroom counter
My pockets too deep, I f-ck around and drown her.
[Verse 2]
Ok, f-ckin on Versace, napping on satin
I love to hit it backwards, call it pig latin
I bought her ass a Mac, now we be iChattin
N-gga swag jackin, but I got my patent
Fre Fresh out the salon, I took her to Milan
I speak a lil french, and hers is no better then mine
I pass her the blunt, she probly hit it one time
Catch us at the game sittin on the baseline
We can call a timeout, take a lil time out
Pockets too deep, shawty you gon have to climb out
Babiana prom dress with your spine out
And I live on the beach, you can get that panty line out
She wants to own me and I aint tryna to fight it
She said is her d-ck, she got it copyrighted
And I dont pay for p-ssy because im p-ssy priceless
I go fishing in it, and I ain't a Pisces
Uh, Gucci only to the grocery store
Stop playin bitch you ballin like Okafor
Ha, And now we headed to the dealer
im goin to cop my baby somethin with no ceilings. Ahhh
