[Chorus 2x]
Fire Flame, Flame, Fire Flame Spitters
Fire Flame, Flame, Fire Flame Spitters

[Lil Wayne]
Fresh out from my bid
bitch it's Lil Tuneche
I Lucille Ball, bitch I love Lucy
if these n-ggas dogs, I'm animal cruelty
dont f-ck with me at all, cause I'm twisted like an Rubiks cube
oh my, look how the time has flown
and they say time is of the essence
but what if there clock is wrong
but all my problems will be second
and all my worries will be gone
I'll have money back for breakfast smell like "bitch I'm rich cologne"
ha, I'm so relaxed my Gucci flats aint got a scratch
if you got a problem with I, well I will fix them, cataracts
they say it cost to be the boss
I paid the price including tax
bitch I'm a fire flame spitter
and to me you n-ggas wax
[Chorus]
(What ya talking bout)
[Birdman]
In this World with my Tommy gun
banana clip the red rum
100 millions dollars, put my life down for my son
spend a little cash, bust a n-gga ass
5 star n-gga, 2 mill on the dash
yeah, militant minded
upown soldier, you have been blinded
grinding all the time, bitch
stuntin, and we shining
diving in deep sh-t, the money keep climbing
blah, the bottles keep poppin'
Dom P, Rose, Perrier poppin'
them bitches see we rocking, the whips we be rocking
iced up, tatted up, fire flame blaaap
[Chorus]
[Lil Wayne]
Uh, I got p-ssy coming to me
shotgun in my draws make your woman bite the bullet
sittin' in my hog, tell my chauffer "to the penthouse"
pockets so deep its like my money gotta swim out
Marley say f-ck em, Scoob say f-ck em
bitch I'm still the best overall, like a jumper
Weezy F, F, fire flame spitter
hundred million dollars, pocket change n-gga
[Birdman]
See these first class flights
we strapped up in the trenches
n-gga want some business b-tch
we getting it in this business
some ten figure n-ggas blood rich gang n-gga
fire flame spitters, point blank n-gga
money and the power, swag out the shower
spending n-gga, then them p-ssy's running like some cowards

[Chorus 2x]
Fire Flame, Flame, Fire Flame Spitters
Fire Flame, Flame, Fire Flame Spitters
Bitch We tha Bizness, Hundred Million Dollars
Bitch We tha Bizness, Hundred Million Dollars
