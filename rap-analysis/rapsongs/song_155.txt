Hey Em, you know you my favorite white boy, right?
I, I owe you for this one
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flowz been hot for so long
If you thinkin' I'm fuckin' fall off your so wrong
I'm innocent in my head, like a baby born dead
Destination heaven, sittin' politic with passengers from nine eleven
The Lord's blessin's leave me lyrically inclined
Shit, I ain't even got to try to shine
God's the seamstress, the tailor fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain, I could spit at yo dame
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
50 fear no man, warrior, swingin' swords like Conan
Picture me, pen in hand writin' lines knowin' the source'll quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops, should that make me bitter?
I caught cases I copped out, does that make me a quitter?
In this white man's world, I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin' for slut wit a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today my phone'll stop ringin' again
These industry niggas ain't friends, they know how to pretend
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flowz been hot for so long
If you thinkin' I'm fuckin' fall off your so wrong
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flowz been hot for so long
If you thinkin' I'm fuckin' fall off your so wrong
If ya patiently waitin' to make it through all the hatin'
Debatin' whether or not you can even weather the storm
Unless you lay on the table they operatin' to save you
It's like an angel came to you sent from the Heavens above
They think they crazy but they ain't crazy
Let's face it, shit, basically they just playin' sick
They ain't shit, they ain't sayin'
Shit, spray em', 50
A to the K get in the way I'll bring Dre and them wit me
And turn this day into fuckin' mayhem, you stayin' wit me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not tryna confuse you
When I let loose wit this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message? Am I gettin' through to you?
You know what's comin', you motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix em' up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killas tied up in a knot
The juggernauts of this rap shit, like it or not
It's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
You put ya life in this, nothin' like survivin' a shot
Y'all know what time it is, soon as 50 signs on this dot
Shit, what you know about death threats? 'Cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Them cowards fucked wit the wrong building, they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children
It's nuclear showers
There's nothin spookier
Ya now about to witness the power of fuckin' 50
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flowz been hot for so long
If you thinkin' I'm fuckin' fall off your so wrong
If the gun spark I'll hear all of the shots go off
It's 50, they say it's 50
See a nigga layed out wit his fuckin' top blown off
It's 50, man that wasn't 50, don't holla my name
You shouldn't throw stones,  if you live in a glass house
And if you got a glass jaw, you should watch yo mouth
'Cause I'll break yo face, have yo ass run mumblin' to the jake
You goin' 'gainst me dawg, you makin' a mistake
I'll split ya, leave ya lookin' like the Michael Jackson jackets
Wit all them zippers
I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper
The way I turn the money over, you should call me flipper
Yo bitch, a regular bitch, you callin' her wifey
I fucked and feed her fast food, you keeping her icey
I'm down to sell records but not my soul
Snoop said this in ninety-four, "We don't love them hoes"
I got pennies for my thoughts now I'm rich
See the twenties spinnin' lookin' mean on the six
Niggas wearin' flags 'cause the colors match they clothes
They get caught in the wrong hood
They filled up wit holes, motherfucker
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flowz been hot for so long
If you thinkin' I'm fuckin' fall off your so wrong
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flowz been hot for so long
If you thinkin' I'm fuckin' fall off your so wrong
