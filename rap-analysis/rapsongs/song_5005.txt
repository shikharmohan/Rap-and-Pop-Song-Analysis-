I present the death of The Cool
Well I heard like a group of cows
That all ya enemies wanna shoot you down
They got AK-47s and a bunch of Mac 11s
Semi-automatic weapons that produce kapows
Word on the street is, they all got heaters
They gon' hit you up and you ain't even gon' see it
You got a lotta money, I ain't tryin' be funny
But they say, "Where you goin'? You ain't even gon' need it"
They see you ridin' 'round, shinin' with ya
Fine round diamonds pretty green-eyed lady
Been on the sideline poutin', while you prime time poppin'
Hungry niggaz want a piece of your pastry
I suggest you protect yo' bakery
'Cause they comin' for yo' head
And it's a bounty on that chain
That's hangin' from yo' neck, they said
I don't know, what you've been told in your ear
But I hear it's goin' down, somebody gotta
(Die)
Don't know, what you been told in your ear
But business goin' round, somebody gotta
(Die)
Hit a nigga wit the mini-Mac strap
Clap any nigga think he gettin' Gs' down here
In a meter, any nigga gettin money and my honey
Man, I heard Micheal Young is the re-clown near
Run up on a nigga from the back wit a Mac
Gon' be strapped 'cause a nigga finna squeeze off ten
Run up on this nigga 'Lac, rat-ta-tat-tat
Click clack, where this nigga at? I need sin
Shit is goin' down ever I see him
Bump a nigga out like Oxy-10
And keep a couple of dollars up in the wallet
To pay the cops so they can never box me in
(Die)
That's what I'm thinkin'
While ridin' around polishin' this big pistol
I'ma catch him in the wind, pray the gun don't jam
So until we meet again, nigga it's cool
I don't know, what you've been told in your ear
But I hear it's goin' down, somebody gotta
(Die)
Don't know, what you been told in your ear
But business goin' round, somebody gotta
(Die)
Don't pay them niggaz no mind
They hatin' on you, ain't nobody witta shotty
And plannin' on doin' a robbery, itchin' to catch a body
Creepin' in a stolen jalopy, out there waitin' on you
I'm sittin' in a stolen car, finna rob this nigga
Should I let the mini-Mac or the shotgun hit him?
I been waitin' all day, tryin' spot this nigga
I can't let him get away, I'ma pop this nigga, uh
Plus they don't know about the chopper in the trunk
The Glocks in a box and the nine on tuck
The bulletproof glass, the 40's in the stash
You pull the steerin' wheel and it pop on up
Forty caliber stashed up in the stash box
Bulletproof windows, you couldn't break 'em wit a padlock
Ak in the trunk, where the sounds bump
Two twin Glock 40's and a nine and this damn clock
Man, we finna go up in this club, show a lil' love
Get a few drinks, holla at some girls
Snatch up a pair, leave outta there
Put some 'dro in the air, then go and get some grub
I say we go up in this club, show a lil' love
Get a few drinks, holla at some girls
Snatch up a pair, leave outta there
Put some 'dro in the air, then catch a few slugs
Ay, ay, ay, pull over right here, I gotta take a pee
And don't go nowhere, nigga wait for me
And if some niggaz do kill you in the next few minutes
Just remember my nigga, it's a heaven for a G
Ay ay, hold this right there I'll be
I'll be right back, I gotta take a piss man hold on
Fo' sho, ay man, ay don't leave I'll be right back
Ay, don't leave I'll be back
Hurry your ass up man, damn
Coolest nigga what, Coolest nigga what
Coolest nigga what, hustla fo' life, ay man
Aiyyo, nigga hurry yo' ass up, man
Cool ass nigga man, fuckin' three in the mornin'
Coolest muh'fucker in the world man
Niggaz ain't fuckin' with me man
Nigga high, smokin' fly ass car
I run these motherfuckin' streets
Niggaz out here lookin' for me
Nigga, I wish a motherfucker would
Ay nigga hurry yo' ass up, nigga, damn
Wassup now, nigga?
Ain't too cool now, is you nigga?
