She walked into the court her knees buckle
Saying for a man to survive, he needn't hustle
Seen and been through struggle her whole life
Made a transition from being his ho to his wife
Stifling, the night upend
The ATF bust in
Her daddy was a hustla so she love them
Looked at the jury how can they judge him? She screamed
"Before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away"
Fear in her chest her face with tears
Had her man's back, he was facing years
In her name though the place was his
They trying to take everything except the kids
But years she been through stumbling fights
While he trying to hustle that white
Up all night wondering if he's alive
Seeing him tried she bubbled inside and screamed
"Before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away"
The judge yelled for order
The court reporter making her words shorter
His lawyer sat next to him
She could see how the trial was affecting him
It hurt for her eyes to connect with him
Using her lies for protecting him
They arrested him for murder and gun possession
As they read back her confession she screamed
"Before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away"
The court awaited as the foreman got the verdict from the bailiff
Emotional outbursts tears and smeared makeup
He stated, he was guilty on all charges
She's shaking looking like she took it the hardest
A spin artist, she brought her face up laughing
That's when the prosecutor realized what happened
All that speaking her mind testifying and crying
When this bitch did the crime, the queenpin
"Before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away"

Please let me testify, you accuse me of a
You accuse me of a, you accuse
Please let me testify, you accuse me of a
You accuse me of a
