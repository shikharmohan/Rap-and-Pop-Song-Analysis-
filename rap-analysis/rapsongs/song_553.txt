Y'all know what this is
Can I get a little bit of L-O-V-E?
Can you spend a little bit of dough on me?
Can I get a little bit a ya T-I-M-E?
Boy, if you wanna make it good
You gotta give a little bit of love
Monday feelin' nice
Tuesday you act out
We just break up again
You want me to let you back in
But tonight I'm like no-o-o
My mind says no
But my body and soul said yes, I hate this mess
Boy, you just ain't no good for me
This ain't the way real love should be
Took you back once, took you back twice
Took you back three, four, five times
They said these tricks it's over
Boy, you've been cross the line
Took you back once, took you back twice
Took you back three, four, five times
Can't stay in love wit you, somebody help me
[Incomprehensible] ***** was thugged out
But you bugged out, start trippin'
Flippin' on me all time and it's been like this all my life
No matter how I try
Guess it's the Thug in me
Got my mind on my money, man
I'm spendin' my time on the grind 'til I shine
I'm concentratin' on runnin' thangs
I've been tryna hold it down
And you steady tellin' me it's over now
She always talk loud
She always leave me but always come back around
That's just what we go through
And you know it's so true
Every time I slip up, she behind me
Gon' be right there to remind me
Can I get a little bit of L-O-V-E?
Can you spend a little bit of dough on me?
Can I get a little bit a ya T-I-M-E?
Boy, if you wanna make it good
You gotta give a little bit of love
Can we take a long walk on the beach, get away from the streets?
Baby girl, me and you need to rendezvous
Cancun next week, how that sound to you?
I've been meanin' to spend a little time witchu
I can tell you're fed up from all of the promises
I've been makin' lately
And I haven't delivered but I been so caught in my hustle
Tryna make this payment
And I shoulda considered your feelings
I shoulda been better about it
I shoulda been grown, not childish
I shoulda been way more polished
But my hustle done paid off
And I'm ready to spoil you, love
Come look, what cha boy gon' do?
Let me make this up to you
Can I get a little bit of L-O-V-E?
Can you spend a little bit of dough on me?
Can I get a little bit a ya T-I-M-E?
Boy, if you wanna make it good
You gotta give a little bit of love
Wheezy girl, I can't believe what you sayin'
You know you got it, should meet with my fans
But every time I get a break, I'm layin'
Where? In your arms, all night and day playin'
You want some time, I send you Jacob
Want sunshine then take a vacation
We ain't gon' make it if you keep complainin'
Everybody go through changes
Love is a dangerous thing
It's full of happy and sad faces
Break it up to make up later
Talk it out so it ain't no anger
We need more communication
You should have some consideration
'Cause you knew from the day we met
What type of player you was dealin' wit
Can I get a little bit of L-O-V-E?
Can you spend a little bit of dough on me?
Can I get a little bit a ya T-I-M-E?
Boy, if you wanna make it good
You gotta give a little bit of love
Everything I do, just for me and you
Stack a little paper so it's never rainy days
I got you, but just for me, then you got to
Understand that I hustle, hustle
Diamonds things, I gotta hustle, hustle
Anything that brings the weight up
See a real thug too it's in his nature
It's in his nature
Not tryna say that you about that paper
But me and you, yes, we like that paper
Overseas trips, diamonds on the wrists
You must admit, your boy gets that paper
I like bossin', girl, wit you beside me
Slide wit me, try and take it away
That's when I ride and ride
Can I get a little bit of L-O-V-E?
Can you spend a little bit of dough on me?
Can I get a little bit a ya T-I-M-E?
Boy, if you wanna make it good
You gotta give a little bit of love
If you wanna make it good
You gotta give a little bit of love
Can I get a little bit of L-O-V-E?
Can you spend a little bit of dough on me?
Can I get a little bit a ya T-I-M-E?
Boy, if you wanna make it good
You gotta give a little bit of love
