The ball is tipped and there you are!
Youre running for your life youre a shooting star!
And all the years no one knows
Just how hard youve worked
But know it shows!
Chorus:
In one shining moment its all on the line!
One shining moment youre frozen in time!
The time is short and the road is long!
In the blinking of an eye that moment is gone!
And when its done win or lose!
You always did your best cause inside you knew!
Chorus:
That in one shining moment you reached deep inside!
One shining moment you knew you were alive!
Bridge: 
Feel the beat of your heart!
Feel the wind in youe face!
Its more than an contest!
Its more than a....A race!
(instrumental)
And when its done win or lose!
You always did your best!
Cause inside you knew!
Chorus:
In one shining moment you reached for the sky!
One shining moment you knew yea!
One shining moment youre willing to try!
In one shining moment you knew!
One shining moment!
