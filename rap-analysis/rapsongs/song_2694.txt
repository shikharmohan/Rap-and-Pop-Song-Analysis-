I, I, I don't care
Chyna White, Foxy Brown
I don't care
Yo, consider me a roll model if there's beef in the club
I'm that lil' white bitch that's gonna throw bottles
Me and the fam has this whole model
Fuck you, fuck them, fuck all uh y'all
So what if this is not for kids?
So what if there's a hundred labels that got the bid?
So what if I dreamed the Devil never dared me to sin?
So what if the industry compares me to him?
So what if I write hard?
Or is it really just a big fuckin' deal cuz' it's comin' from a white broad
So what, hear me so what if I bring it?
Most of these rappers who fold up
I don't care if I might be on top, I can give a flyin' fuck
If you like me or not
So what if you think I'm not the illest chick?
I don't care you still gotta feel dis bitch
I don't care
To all the hatas that be lookin' to fade us
We not concerned with what you put in the papers
I don't care
We stayin' focus while you tryna provoke us
We never cared that industry notice
I don't care
Don't give a fuck niggas know I'm buck
Niggas know I'm reppin' they don't fuck wit' me
Bitches know I'm seven go head get slick
Tick this bitch off get cho highway to Heaven, nigga
Slick shit hot shit I'm so gutter
If I die tomorrow I resurrect through my young brother
Oh! God got to warn yah first shawty spit hard
And she rollin' with the brown broad

Niggas know how the fuck I flow

To all the hatas that be lookin' to fade us
We not concerned wit what chu put in the papers

We stayin' focus while you tryna provoke us
We never cared that industry notice
