  (Check me out)
Get fresh Hev
  (Say what)
And do the beatbox
  (Say what, no doubt)
Get fresh Hev
And do the beatbox
Midnight, candlelights, hot wax drips on ya back
Dom P, empty, Cristal it's on it's way I don't play
I'm dead serious, aiyyo I mean this
Straight up ugly faces in exotic places
My erotic taste is, outrageous, upstages
The bravest of lovers, but this one's overweight
Waterbed, now get it straight, Sade' CD, killin' me softly
You know Victoria's Secrets but speak it cause you want me
DK, PJ's, BKNY is where you stay
Always lookin' lovely when you walk around my way
My boo be crispy, forever jiggy, forever with me
Half Puerto Rican, ay papi, ay mami
Get fresh Hev, and do the beatbox
   (No doubt)
Get fresh Hev, and do the beatbox
   (No question)
Get fresh Hev, and do the beatbox
   (No doubt)
Get fresh Hev, and do the beatbox
   (No question)
3 A.M. creeper, crawler, official baller
Hit me on my beeper, this is word to my sneaker
This shorty's dynamite, she's a shook one from Brooklyn
But I represent the Vernon
   (The Vernon?)
Yeah money-earnin'
Now 4th Street park after dark is dangerous
Might get clapped, if you look strange to us
My main objective is to check, the sex
The Rolex, the lucci, Versace, Coogi, Gucci
Chicks dig me, no question, chicks love me, no doubt
They be all up in my house nigga, now what's that all about?
Here's what I like, 138, that's 69 twice in one night
Who's jiggy, Heav' Diggy, no question
My sessions in sex, leave the honeys perplexed
And I don't mean no disrespect but keep it warm and get ya freak on
Get fresh Hev, and do the beatbox
   (No doubt)
Get fresh Hev, and do the beatbox
   (No question)
Get fresh Hev, and do the beatbox
   (No doubt)
Get fresh Hev, and do the beatbox
   (No question)
Well it's that big kid, with the gold front grill 600 Benz
Low pros, chrome rims, Manhattan condominium
Now I imagine scoopin' dime pieces at beauty pageants
Protect your fertible, sex convertible, Lex and Rolex
Content, on how to get G's, I know thieves and criminals
Buff thugs who show love, back rubs from dimes and dub
Hotties with narcotic bodies, my style is urgent
A rap merchant, a major player with flavor
Well it's the H E, you see me, A V Y, that be me
The dress code a pain, some things never change, huh
I stay with bigness, sir jigness, who's in this
I win this hand's down, I get down for this crown
Get fresh Hev, and do the beatbox
   (No doubt)
Get fresh Hev, and do the beatbox
   (No question)
Get fresh Hev, and do the beatbox
   (No doubt)
Get fresh Hev, and do the beatbox
   (No question)
Get fresh Hev, and do the beatbox
   (No doubt)
Get fresh Hev, and do the beatbox
   (No question)
Get fresh Hev, and do the beatbox
   (No doubt)
Get fresh Hev, and do the beatbox
   (No question)
