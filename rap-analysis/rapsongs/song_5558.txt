Yeah.. c'mon man
[Nate] Dump dump dump
You know this shit is ours man
This is our field man
[Nate] Dump dump dump
Y'all niggaz need to just leave this shit to us
[Nate] Dump dump dump
Corny-ass niggaz, aiyyo
[Nate] Dump dump dump
[Havoc]
That's that hard shit
That hit a nigga up in his car shit, this war bitch
Somehow I feel we need more of the thing
Instinct to get that paper, know it's all in my vein
You rookies need to be toilet trained
You faggots shittin everywhere that you eatin
That's why the coroner came
You never know, when the tec'll blow
Wet you and catch you off guard
Niggaz know that I crept slow
And never fold bitch, hollows we let 'em go
And hope them little jugs you sold cover your medical
Y'all don't wanna bump heads with us
Dump lead head to head with us (nah)
And ain't no leg-in homey, neck and up
It come to beef, you know we chef-fen it up (all day baby)
And ain't nobody do it better than us
Dry snitch and we wettin you up
[Nate] Dump dump dump
[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Many men try to set me up to watch me die
Tie me up and put me in the trunk then wave bye-bye (dump dump dump)
Everyone who know me know that I'm Mobb Deep and I
keep it true and ain't afraid to shoot so duck when I (DUMP DUMP DUMP)
Ain't gon' catch me slippin up
Ain't gon' catch me give it up (dump dump dump)
Ain't gon' hear me creepin up
Roll down the window I'm about to (DUMP DUMP DUMP)
[Prodigy]
Nigga I'll smack that smirk right off your face
You listen to jerk music, this is Mobb Deep
You ain't never seen or heard no shit like this
Until you purchase our CD, it's very worth it
Don't confuse our album with that "Mix Tape" shit
Those our scratch, basically our throwaway shit
And nobody wrap the street like the Infamous clique
Slash Jive, now we got millions to work with
And we Violators too, so you know we overdoin it
What's stoppin the crew, only death can ruin it (bring it)
Homey been there and done that, and still they wanna come back
and shoot us down (blaow blaow blaow)
Our advice, you want somethin done right
then you better come and do it yourself
We give shooters this shits, make O.G.'s get they gun off the shelf
And blow the dust off they old snub-nose three pound
[Nate] Dump dump dump
[Chorus]
[Nate Dogg]
Shoot 'em up now bang, bang
Don't fuck around with the wrong mayne
In every fuckin city it's the same thang
Don't be sayin nothin stupid to a grown mayne
Shoot 'em up now bang, bang
It really ain't the same, now the game changed
Got me grippin on my weapon just to main-tain
Fill you full of holes and get my name changed
[Chorus]
