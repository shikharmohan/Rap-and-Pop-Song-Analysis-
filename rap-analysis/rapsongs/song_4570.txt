[Chorus]
Help!, Help!
Help, I need somebody
Help, not just anybody
Help, you know I need someone
Help!, Help!
Help, I need somebody
Help, not just anybody
Help, you know I need someone
Help!, Help!
Verse 1:
So sick need a doc, yes
A creature, monster like the loch ness
I gets hotter by the tock, when I sizzle to death
I just tell the clock "Give me a sec"
In the middle of the war, where my enemy at?
I'm running this shit like Eric B. enemy back
'Cause every time I hit a track I'm like a energy pack
The instruments are cryin' out
"Where the sympathy at?!"
I attack before you begin to react
I'm from the dirt where The Beatles and John Lennon be at
And now these niggas lookin' yellow like a penalty flag
It's Weezy Baby with this hustle til infinity, yeah
Like somebody let the dog out the kennel and ran
Whoever did it was a very smart woman or man
'Cause I'm coming like the stomp of every marching band
I need y'all to arch ya hands
And pray for me
I need
[Chorus]
Help, I need somebody
Help, not just anybody
Help, you know I need someone
Help!, Help!
Help, I need somebody
Help, not just anybody
Help, you know I need someone
Help!, Help!
