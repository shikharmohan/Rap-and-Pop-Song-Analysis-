Cruisin' through the neighborhood, some say I'm no good
Claimin' I'm a criminal but let's make it understood
Just one man with a whole lot of homeboys
Ya get the click of the glock when I pull of the chrome toy
Check me an' I'll check you back
Then jump back to my big Buddah like I'm not a bad guy
But don't take advantage, I'm throwin' out the garbage
Just show me where the can is
All I was doin' was searchin' for the boon
Then some punk tried to hit me with a broom
Lucky I ducked quick or else I'd be assed up
Last thing I wanted was have to pull a gatt out
Here comes a nigga an' he's got a .38
Well, my roundhouse said hey, yo, I'm shootin' up straight
'Cuz I put away the shotgun, borrow me a glock
Took a little trip to the funky weed spot
Tried to jack me but homie got shot
La la la la, la la la la
Understand where I'm comin' from
Self defense turns to the offense
Understand where I'm comin' from
Self defense turns to the offense
Couple o' niggas from the east side fuckin' up ya program
No one witnessed but they heard the gun blast
Left the problem unsolved, now I'm gonna sum up
How people gettin' hurt in the process of the come up
Gotta with the fools that'll wait for you to run up
Rollin' in the hood that's already shot up
Pocket full of gatts an' see if we can spot the
Homie that's slick in the process of the dip
When we find this out gonna unload the clip
An' take a little trip down to Rio
My neighborhood's hot an' so I gots to go chill
'Cuz I put away the shotgun, borrow me a glock
Took a little trip to the funky weed spot
Tried to jack me but homie got shot
La la la la, la la la la
Understand where I'm comin' from
Self defense turns to the offense
Understand where I'm comin' from
Self defense turns to the offense
Kickin' that funky Cypress Hill shit
Think I'll load a clip, let's see if you can deal with
'Cuz the bulletproof vest ain't shit
When the infrared's pointin' at your head, kid
An' that's just too bad, yo
Now I'm headed up a river in a boat with no paddle
Shoulda put the glock down
Now they got me in lockdown
Livin' like a nigga that done lost his mind
'Cuz self defense turns to the offense
But nobody even really knows that
All they see is me an' the gatt
Up in the court room, lookin' at the jury
Starin' down the punk ass District Attorney
La la la la, la la la la
Verdict's in, you're not guilty as charged
'Cuz I put away the shotgun, borrow me a glock
Took a little trip to the funky weed spot
Tried to jack me but homie got shot
La la la la, la la la la
Understand where I'm comin' from
Self defense turns to the offense
Understand where I'm comin' from
Self defense turns to the offense
Understand where I'm comin' from
Self defense turns to the offense
Understand where I'm comin' from
Self defense turns to the offense
Understand where I'm comin' from
