I go to Jacob wit 25 thou, you go wit 25 hundred, wow
I got eleven plaques on my wall right now
You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow
H to the Izzo, did 3 thou spins in a week
You get a thou in a month, wow
Y'all niggas want credit but y'all need to slow down
Kanye to the killin', y'all from Chi-town, how your wife gon' say
She never sold drugs a day in her life but she still wanna pump the ye
And y'all mad 'cuz y'all not knowin' 'cuz these canaries so yellow
When y'all pull up whether to stop or keep goin'
I got G's, rock Rock n Roll tees wit no sleeves
That's showin', tucked in strap showin'
How he get seven TV's in that 'lac 'lac
3 in the front, 2 in the back, 2 in that back, back
While you in that hatchback
And tryin' to sell work and don't get shit from them packs back
And try to rap, the studios won't give you ya daps back
And try to get publishin', all you get in your ass capped
And that's that
I go to Jacob wit 25 thou, you go wit 25 hundred, wow
I got eleven plaques on my wall right now
You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow
Magazines call me a rock star, bitches call me cock star
Billboard pop star, neighborhood block star
Chi-town go getting pimps, we mob stars
Gingerbread man even says, "You're a monster"
Remember that, 'Uh-Huh' that's that trek shit
Remember back in '92 niggas used to catch reck shit
Remember that track I tracked for you 'bout 3 months ago
'Uh-huh' that's the one, now, cut my check, bitch
And I ain't feelin' that Lexus or that CLK
See me like damn A C L K

I ain't know we rap as good as he do beats and then
I go to Jacob wit 25 thou, you go wit 25 hundred, wow
I got eleven plaques on my wall right now
You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow
H to the Izzo did 3 thou spins in a week
You get a thou in a month, wow
Y'all niggas want credit but y'all need to slow down
Kanye to the killin', y'all from Chi-town
