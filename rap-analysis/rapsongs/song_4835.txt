Chorus
I love it when you cross my mind, my mind, my mind
I think about you all the time, all the time, all the time
Girl I cant get my mind off youoowhoo
I cant get my mind off youoowhoo
I cant get my mind off youoowhoo
Girl its you no one but you
Cause You're my baby girl
		Ludacris
Listen can't get you off my mind
Even if I tried
You're my life
Cross my heart and hope to die
Don't care what people thinking
Don't care what people say
Well make it last for ever
And then make them people pay
Cause all they do is doubt us
But they don't understand
That you're my only women 
And im your only man
Lets fly away and go somewhere where its 81 degrees
Then jump up on a yacht and sail the 7 seas
Ill climb the highest mountains just to kiss your face
Then put some spice up in your life just to get a taste
Don't nothing feel wrong Im still gone
And your tip toeing through my mind with your heals on (Get it girl)
			Chorus
I love it when you cross my mind, my mind, my mind
I think about you all the time, all the time, all the time
Girl I cant get my mind off youoowhooo
I cant get my mind off you youowhoo
I cant get my mind off youowhoo
Girl its you no one but you
Cause You're my baby girl
			Ludacris
My baby girl and I promise for you ill do whatever
And I can think of many things that we can do together
Lets go shopping Cuase a woman needs options and diamonds and pearls
Then go eat at the finest resturants around the world
Drink from the finest grapes smoke from the finest leaves
Draped in the finest clothes I wanna put your mind at ease
A full body massage and then let's go catch a movie
Ahh fuck it lets go home and make a movie
Before we can hit the park go find a quiet spot
Then ill make my body move untill your body stops
Cause you know that special spot
It aint that hard to find
Plus you've been pacing through my mind all the time
			Chorus 
I love it when you cross my mind, my mind, my mind
I think about you all the time, all the time, all the time
Girl I cant get my mind off youoowhooo
I cant get my mind off you youowhooo
I cant get my mind off youowhooo
Girl its you no one but you
Cause You're my baby girl
