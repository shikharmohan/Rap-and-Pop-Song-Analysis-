[Young Jeezy] 
I said I'm corporate thuggin CTE 
Until the day I day that's the way its gonna be 
Thug motivation I'm bumpin number three 
Blowin on some killer shit that I got from zone three 
Blowin on the smile yeah we call it Tennessee 
I'm good in every hood everybody know me 
So don't wake me up I swear to God I'm dreamin 
Paper on the way ain't a nigga still beamin 
Lookin fly in the cockpit a nigga still leanin 
Money out here so a nigga still scheming 
And I ain't make music for the mothafuckin critics 
They don't understand cause they ain't mothafuckin live it 
And I ain't trippin on the Source I got a mothafuckin plug 
Give me five mics I'm still a mothafuckin thug 
Now the question is can a nigga really rap? 
And the answer is you ever been to the trap? 
Bitch I make hits 
You niggas waste time 
And I'll be God damned if I let you waste mine 
Life changed for the better but I'm still strapped 
Trigga happy nigga don't make me relapse 
Attitude like fuck it they hating anyway 
And I could give a fuck what a nigga got to say 
You still talking blow? You God damn right 
What else I'm gonna say that's my mothafuckin life 
I just left Jamaica I'm talking Nochas Rias 
Sipping margaritas on the beach in my adidas 
Brought a few pills but that's only for the skeezas 
Use my black card but that's only for the reefer 
Whats Up 
[Chorus ' Young Jeezy] 
Not a day goes by that I ain't high 
Hit the mall everyday nigga I stay fly (so fly) 
26 inches yeah I'm sittin up high (so high) 
and I'm a keep it hood hommie that's no lie 
Not a day goes by that I ain't high 
Hit the mall everyday nigga I stay fly (so fly) 
Get it how we live yeah we tryin to get by (so high) 
We throw it all in the air baby that's no lie
