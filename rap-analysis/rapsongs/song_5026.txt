Look at what we did
Came a long way from dirty ghetto kids
Yeah, look at what we did
We came a long way from dirty ghetto kids
Yeah, you know what it is, c'mon
Well, the cops didn't fine 'em for grindin', no
They kinda blew the vibe, figured it was time to go
Plus he had to be at home a long time ago
And he had made like ten dollars off the song he wrote
It read, 'A lil' hungry and need a lil' money
It's for my lil' sister and her lil' tummy'
Wasn't lyin' though, he didn't go buy hydro
Went to the restaurant and bought two guiros
'Cause he knew they wasn't cookin' where he live
The cooca cooca coots now took him to the crib
A lil' hurt from the rail, he took into the ribs
Right pass the pushers who couldn't under dig
"What's the use of pushin'? You ain't pushin' none of this
If I kick it with y'all, I'm just pushin' for a bid"
But what was on his mind and push him to the lid
Their best customer wasn't cookin' for her kids
Gets up to pump, so he kick, push
Over his shoulders, he swore he'd never look
'Cause wasn't nothin' back there but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive
Yeah, and so he kick, push
Over his shoulders, he swore he'd never look
'Cause wasn't nothin' back there but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive
Yeah, you see his mom was a crack head
And his father couldn't be contacted
He knew what bein' different was, combated
Amongst the other things on his young, black head
And see his girl was a white girl
But just 'cause she was white
See, her life wasn't light world
She too had the drama thick
Had a daddy and a mama but her daddy used to mama hit
Daddy caught somethin' chasin' fatties, made her mama sick
Couldn't afford the medicine, pimped her to the pharmacist
And suicidal feelings would rise
Switch over the transition 'til her conquer it
Pays for mama's pills with a sponsorship
Her cell phone bill and a Honda kit
And that's why she skates with he
Someone to feel her pain and a place to be
That's why, that's why, that's why she kick, push
Over her shoulders, she swore she'd never look
'Cause wasn't nothin' back there but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive
Yeah, that's why she kick, push
Over her shoulders, she swore she'd never look
'Cause wasn't nothin' back there but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive
Yeah, a travelin' band of misfits and outcasts
Nod their heads from Misfits to Outkast
A lot of scars, they did this without pads
A lot of hearts who did this without dads
One's father was filthy rich
Two was middle class and one was homeless
And then the paralyzed girl in the wheelchair
Who just liked to watch and that was the whole clique
I think about 'em every time I see this old flick
L's taken in the park, in front of this old bench
They wrote on the back, "We thankful, 'Push, Kick'
Hope you make a video, the beat is so sick"
Well, I did, I hope you seen it
It's on MTV, 'Soundtracks of Genius'
Love from Tony Hawk, beat from the Ice Creamaz
Before we put it out, had to pay the Philippines
Just to show him how you kick, push
Over ya shoulders you swore you'd never look
'Cause wasn't nothin' back there but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive
Yeah, that's why you kick, push
Over ya shoulders, you swore you'd never look
'Cause wasn't nothin' back there but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive, yeah
