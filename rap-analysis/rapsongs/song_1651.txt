Del:
Who is the two like the Blues Brothers?
Unicron:
Yeah, who does it?
Del:
Me & you kid
we bruise dozens
& hundreds of kids
havin' fun with the wiz
that's me and,
Unicron:
Unicron, the inhuman on the mic
Yikes! (Zoinks!)
Del:
Lazer zaps saps who can't rap
they sound like beginners
I slam then I pin ya
send ya to the hospital
I gots the flow
no nigga dare step
you'll get your hair swept
off the floor when I clip ya
button ya lip ya
even if the record skips
I still rip (Damn that nigga still rips!)
total rivers
equip ya punk posse
ya got lots to see
days to come
before you raise from dumb to smarter
rippin' apart a poser
bend 'em
inside out, like Yoga
I'm a nice person on the inside
but men hide
when you and your friend die
but a hand to the strangler
the Beni Hanna chopper
and we oughtta pop ya
and crop ya
cause we're sick of that shit (Sick of it!)
I'm about to have a fit
& split ya head
& kick ya bitch, in the tits
they're tender
mixin' niggas brains like a blender
I kick rhymes like these to inja
and end ya
off ya
never comin' softer
this is not the best I can offer
I'ma save some for later
you ain't  greater
than the man
with a plan
and the brand that his name
and I hate ya.

Unicron:
I'm the youngsta
with the swift tongue,
and the kid that lives up the street
over Jon's beat
I make rappers eat turds and hay
it doesn't matter what version you play
I will still slay
a crowd a rhymers
and Del how'd I find ya?
Del:
That one summer years ago I shoulda signed ya.
Unicron:
Just a quick reminder
for those who find a
problem with me
I'll put you on noid like a T & T timer
and there's only 20 seconds
now I'm 16
and yes fiend to wreck shit
I throw temper tantrums
that's my anthem
I'm not very big
but you phuck with me, you'll be like Jerry's kids
phucked up, & that's tough luck
Unicron has never backed down from a tough phuck
that's what lubricated Trojans are for
cause I know, when the corn hits the tip
I got the dip
flip & they suckin' on my nipples
and I will have a fut, too
cause I get excited when I ride it
fun while it lasted
Cas, did you like
when I did a song, back in the day with the Del-a-ray? (That's me!)
Get a patna
I'm glad you got the chance
to enhance the Jive roster
I'm a foster kid
but Del hooked me
now I look free when I'm out,
Del: And I'm out...
