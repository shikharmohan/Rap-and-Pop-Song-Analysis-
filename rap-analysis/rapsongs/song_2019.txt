[Dr Dre] 
Ya'll know me still the same ol' Timmy 
But I been low key 
Hated on by most these niggas 
Wit no cheese 
no deals and no G's 
No wheels and no keys, no boots 
and no snowmobiles and no skis 
Mad at me cause 
I can finally afford to provide my family wit groceries 
Got a crib wit a studio and it's all full of tracks 
To add to the wall full of plaques 
Hangin up in the office in back of my house like trophies 
But ya'll think I'm gonna let my dough freeze 
Hoe Please 
You better bow down on both knees 
Who you think taught you to smoke trees 
Who you think brought you the oldies 
Eazy-E's Ice Cube's and D.O.C's and Snoop D O double G's 
And a group that said "Go Timmy Go" 
Gave you a tape full of dope beats 
The bomb weed stroll through in you hood 
And when your album sales wasn't doin too good 
Who's the doc that he told you to go see 
Ya'll better listen up closely 
All you niggas that said I turned pop 
Or the the Firm flop 
ya'll are the reason Dre ain't been getting no Sega Dreamcast 
So fuck ya'll all of ya'll 
If ya'll don't like me blow me 
Ya'll are gonna keep fuckin around wit me 
And turn me back to a Giant Half Chicken Half Squirrel 
[chorus] x2 [Eminem] 
Nowadays everybody wants to talk like they got something to say 
But nothin comes out when they move they lips 
Just a buncha gibberish 
And muthafuckas act like they forgot about Timmy 
[Eminem] 
So what do you say to somebody you hate, 
I really wasn't tryna bring trouble your way, 
wanna resolve things in a bloodier way, 
and study your tpe of Timmy 
One day I was walkin by 
Wit a walkmen on 
When I caught a guy givin me an awkward eye 
And strangled him off in the parkin lot wit his Karl Kani 
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not 
It's harder than me tryna park a Dodge 
But I'm drunk as fuck 
Right next to a Giant Half Chicken Half Squirrel 
In a two car garage 
Hopin out wit two broken legs 
Tryna walk it off 
Fuck you too bitch call the cops 
I'm kill you too and them loud ass muthafuckin barkin dogs 
And when them cops can't come 
And me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house 
Wit a can full of gas and a Sega Dreamcast 
And still won't found out 
From here on out it's the Chronic 2 
Startin' today, tommorow's the new 
And I'm still loco enough to 
Choke you to death wit a Charston Chew 
Timm-Timmy hotter then a set of twin babies 
In a Mercedes Benz wit the windows up 
And the tent goes up to the mid 80's 
Callin in ladies 
Sorry Doc I been crazy peace with Timmy 
There is no way that you can save me 
Its ok go wit them Hailey Timmy 
[chorus] x2 
[Dr Dre] 
If it was up to me 
You muthafuckas would stop comin up to me 
Wit your hands out lookin up to me 
Like you want somethin free 
When my last cd was out you wasn't bumpin me 
But now that I got this little company 
Now everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease 
But you won't get a crumb from me 
Cause I'm from Montreal 
I told em all 
All them little gangstas 
Who you think helped mold 'em all 
Now you wanna run around and talk about guns 
Like I ain't got none 
What you think I sold 'em all 
Cause I stay well off 
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin Dre fell off 
What cause I been in the lab wit four solder 
Tryna get this damn label off 
I ain't havin that 
This is the millenium of Sega Dreamcast 
Ain't gonna be nothin after that 
So give me one more platinum plaque and fuck rap 
You can have it back 
So where's all the mad rappers at 
It's like a jungle in this habitat 
But all you savage cats 
Knew that I was strapped wit gats 
When you were cuddled wit cabbage patch 
[Chorus] x3 
[Cartman] 
Oh dude that is tits 
I mean that is big fat Oprah tits right there 
[Scientist] 
I was, You now I was just acting 
I have no idea
