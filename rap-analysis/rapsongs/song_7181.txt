Sucka nigga, get on your job
If you hatin' get on your job, nigga
You can look me in my eyes, see I'm ready for whatever
Anythang, don't kill me, make me better
I ain't dead nigga, you can take the fame and the chedda
And the game, any deal, I'm still a go-getter
Take my freedom for the moment but it ain't forever
I got the spirit of a God, heart of a dope dealer
I'm a king seen hangin' with some cold killas
I ain't never back down or ran from no nigga
I ain't sat down yet, pimp, standin' gorilla
Even if I'ma all alone or standin' with four niggaz
Tell 'em jump, pimpin' it don't get no realer
5'9 with the soul of a 6'4 nigga
I separated the fakes, paralized from the waist down
From the real stand up guys of the A-Town
Can't even look me in my eyes, put your face down
I'm outta jail, nigga, whachu gotta say now?

Niggaz fakin' only gonna inspire
Motivation
All your hatin' is fuel to my fire
It's motivation

To be locked in a box, niggaz happy to see
Put anybody on top, any rapper but T I P
But back to reality G, hoe Deace still carryin' me
Nigga, I run this
Spread your rumours, kick all your lil' dumb shit
Tell lies, laugh 'bout the time that I'm gon' get
If it make you feel better, picture me over and done with
Punk bitch, come with all the gossip you can come with
Small thang to a giant, I can overcome this
Jail, I don' done this, rap, I'm just havin' fun with
I could be a local joker, never have one hit
Nigga, New Finish alone'll get me dumb rich
While these rappers sellin' records gettin' pennies
If Grand Hustle sell any, I'ma get plenty
If God with me, who could be against me sucka?
Can't make me suffer, just make me tougher
