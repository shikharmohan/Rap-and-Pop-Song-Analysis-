Uh, Umm, Weezy ya'll,
Young Money, Cash Money,
This is the drought 3, 
Ladies and gentlemens, You know me,
[verse 1]
You know I ride for my muthafuckin'niggas,
Most likely imma die with my finger on the trigga,
They tell me dont get high, and I should try to make a living,
I tell em' i'm a hustler, and I'd rather make a killing
My eyes get so wide as it rise in the skillet,
I let my bitch bag it, if she steal it, imma kill her,
I bulletproof the ride, now I feel like armadillas,
And fuck ya,hospital, young money, we the illest
And I aint gotta lie when I tell you im the illest,
My flow is nasty, like C Y Phyllis,
Self made G, and them bitches know the business.
Relying on rap, but in the kitchen I'm a chemist,
And when I was 5, my favorite movie was The Grimilins
Aint got shit to do with this, but I just thought that I should mention,
You looking for devine and the little intervention,
And them birds don't fly, without my permission,
I'm probably in the sky, flying with the fishes,
Or maybe in the ocean, swimming with the pigeons,
See my world is different,
Like Dwayne Wayne,
And if you want trouble, bitch, I want the same thang,
[course]
And you know that imma ride with my muthafuckin niggas,
Most likely imma die with my finger on the trigga,
Don't worry bout mine, imma grind till i get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit,
The sky is the limit,
The sky is the limit,
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
Cuz the sky is the limit,
The sky is the limit,
And if you look high, you see that im gonna be in it
The sky is the limit,
[verse2]
Buck Ten in the coupe, And your bitch love it,
Switching lane faster than she switch subject,
Tell a bitch don't talk to me,
And if you're talking to them niggas, don't talk for free,
And I hate when a nigga say talk is cheap,
Cuz im the type to let money talk for me,
My flow is art, unique,
My flow can part a sea,
The only thing on a mind of a shark, is eat,
By any means, and you're just sardines,
I got the 40 cal. Tucked in my p.r.p's.,
What do you expect, im from New Orleans,
And majority of my city is riders,
They tried to make a brand new map without us,
But the tourists come down and spend too many dollars,
And no matter how you change it, it will still be ours
[course]
And imma ride with my muthafuckin niggas,
Most likely imma die with my finger on the trigga,
Don't worry bout mine, imma grind till i get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit,
The sky is the limit,
The sky is the limit,
And imma tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit,
Because the sky is the limit,
Yeah, the sky is the limit,
And if you look up high, you'll see that I'm gonna be in it,
Cuz the sky is the limit,
[bridge]
And you don't wanna fuck with a soldier,
Use your head, or I'll take it off ya shoulder,
Run up in your house and shoot everyone that's sitting on the livingroom sofa,
And you don't wanna fuck with a soldier,
Use your head, or ill take it off ya shoulder,
Mail it to your mom, with a dozen of roses, (Now that's fucked up)
And I'm a G,
And you aint gotta know the alphabets to see,
I know my whole city is depending on me,
And I forget a lot of shit, but I could never forget the streets
[course]
So you know that im gonna ride with my muthafuckin niggas,
Most likely imma die with my finger on the trigga,
Don't worry bout mine, imma grind till i get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit,
The sky is the limit,
Don't worry bout mine, imma grind till i get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit,
Because the sky is the limit,
Yeah, the sky is the limit,
And If you look high, you'll see that im gonna be in it,
Cuz the sky is the limit
They tell me dont get high, not to try to make a living,
I tell em' i'm a hustler, and I'd rather make a killing
Cuz the sky is the limit
Hands up in the air, because the sky is the limit,
Can you see me up there? The sky is the limit,
The sky is the limit,
