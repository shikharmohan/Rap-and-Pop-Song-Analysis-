Yo... (Can I see you?) 
Lauryn Hill on the track... (In the morning) 
New art got my back... 
DJ Skribble just relax, haha! 
I'm a get you the joint! haha! (Can I see you?) 
Yeah... morning (In the morning!) 
Uh Huh, Uh Huh, Uh Huh, Uh Huh, Uh Huh, Uh Huh! 
As I span the cosmos 
Mahogany travel at the speed of sound 
Span the mainstream but still esteemed underground 
My parameters, and wrap up contaminants 
Travel twice Earth's diameter, intimidating amateurs 
At the Apollo, I played the shepherd sheep followed 
Chicks try to model after me like I'm Tyra Banks 
Wanna thank me because my statements are prodigious 
Styles so prestigious, make a sinner act religious 
Street academics, seen alot of girls mimic 
But when it's all over you can tell who's the gimmick 
L slang-bangs like a dub plate 
Jericho Sound System, mash up your club dates 
Sweeter than a cherry on a fruit cocktail 
Whenever, Wherever, Whatever 
Like Maxwell 
My pentium, makes more chips than Intel 
I didn't mean to turn you on like Sherell 
Kids move they body like they're tripping off of acid 
Not even fantasy can surpass it 
Once you blast it one starts to feel kinky 
I think thee, goes by the name of Young Slinky 
And just when you thought it was safe to relax 
L-Boogie spits with perfect syntax! 
Then, DJ Skribble make you dribble on the wax 
DJ Skribble make you dribble on the wax! 
Can I hear you in the morning (Can I see you?) 
like I hear you late at night? 
Chance to hear you (In the morning) 
Amp the party 
DJ Skribble keep it tight 
(Can I see you?) 
Just a short time in the morning 
Like I hear you late at night (In the morning) 
Chance to hear you 
Amp the party 
DJ Skribble keep it tight! 
Can I hear you in the morning (Can I see you?) 
Like I hear you late at night (In the morning!) 
Chance to hear you 
Amp the party 
DJ Skribble, KEEP IT TIGHT!!! 
Forte' 3x 
Keep it tight!
