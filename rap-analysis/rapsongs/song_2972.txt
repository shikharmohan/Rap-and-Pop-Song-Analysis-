This particular song right here is
Dedicated to the black woman
And it doesn't pertain to all black women
Some of y'all disrespect y'allself
Because you don't know who you are in the first place
This is out of common respect for all women period
Word up like this song
Yo, I'm quite single, and occaisionally I mingle
But aside from all the rest, she sparks my interest
No, ma'am, I don't know you
Just offering the common respect I feel I owe you
Also some conversation, companionship
Common-ground and common-sense
There's no such thing as coincidence in, me finding you here
And I really hate screaming in your ear, so some other time, ok?
I waited a day, hello, this the caller you told from a couple of days ago
You sound tired, forgive me if I call you too late
But what better time to relate mind-state? Where could I begin?
Hasn't anyone ever told you you got beautiful skin?
You're more than welcome, what do you desire within?
I just wanna be, there's no need to put titles on you and me
Those are limitations, living and learning are our only obligations
Equality, honesty, independence, intelligence, emotion and devotion
Humbly seeking to hear God when he's speaking
At one time my mind just couldn't conceive
A woman had to dress a certain way to believe
But in the same breath, allow me to say
That, if you believed young lady, you wouldn't dress that way
And I was attracted to your class, I couldn't see all yo' ass
And I was very content, you deserved every complement
Now remember our indifferences make us the same
You gotta have some game or many of you
Won't even be able to take care of yourself, uh
And love, when I look at you, I see my reflection
So I offer my love, affection and protection
Shawty, you dead fine but the bottom-line is you're still my sister
Well, I say you're my beginnin', my end
You're my sista lover and friend
God is your light from within
It shines through your beautiful skin
What they say 'bout you ain't true
There's no me if there is no you
I hope that you understand
You got to respect yourself before I can
Yeah, I met you and y'all knew, saw you again on Marietta
Downtown Atlanta, checkin' your long legs, got me smirkin'
Fixed me dinner one night, candles lit
Kinda thought you was slick in the beginnin'
But it turned out you wouldn't lie
Looked me in my eye, I listened
Sucked it up, pushed on, we made amends, both sides clicked
True friends, since then years done gone by
Brought a baby girl into this world, made our parents grandfolks
Household with no hope, took care of ye, you me
When shit got put out on the curb
Closer than the skin on the back of my hand
Through the thick and thin, we can win
Beautiful black skin
Well, I say you're my, beginnin', my end
You're my sista lover and friend
God is your light from within
It shines through your beautiful skin
What they say 'bout you ain't true
There's no me if there is no you
I hope that you understand
You got to respect yourself before I can
No need to compete with the music loud
Or stairs cold, put on a scale of one to ten, you a twelve
I chose her over jail and hell
Originally from ATL
Compatible souls come together, under bad weather
To discuss distrust amongst the so-called
Good in every woman, how I wish this was true
I deal with facts only, already done cloned me
Why I sang the blues, when there's only one God
That watches over our every step, I need his help
When I'm walkin', lookin' for the right female, I can't tell sometimes
They tell me the devil's comin' humble in his approach
Spontaneous with the game
He caught the naive of a girl fallin' for the ok
Let the pistol smoke the one you live by
Die by, examples of how relationships can be
I rolls the dice, takin' a chance at crappin' out
Like today boy, I lost one of my best hips
Natural thick lips, no animal fat implants
Wide load, just started workin' at the airport
19 years old, worth more than her weight in gold
But it was all my fault, so don't cry, understand
If down the line I want you back and the feelin' ain't mutual
Just promise me you'll find a new man, that's 'bout some business
Hope she find what her was lookin' for, like a dream to my end
I wanted to be more than friends
Beautiful black skin
Well, I say you're my beginnin', my end
You're my sista lover and friend
God is your light from within
It shines through your beautiful skin
What they say 'bout you ain't true
There's no me if there is no you
I hope that you understand
You got to respect yourself before I can
Well, I say you're my beginnin', my end
You're my sista lover and friend
God is your light from within
It shines through your beautiful skin
What they say 'bout you ain't true
