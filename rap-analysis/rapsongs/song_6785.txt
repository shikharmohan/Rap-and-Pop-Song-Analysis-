Intro:(R.Kelly): Uhh, Yea, Snoop, Kells once again, 
and this is for the nonbelievers, that seem to think that Pimpin Aint EZ, A yo Uncle Snoop, let's go get these knuckle heads...
Chorus:(R. Kelly): 
Pop bottles, shake hands, 
Recognize, I'm the man, 
I tried to tell 'em but they won't understand, 
That Pimpin Aint EZ, 
I got money, I got cars, 
Still fuckin with them hood superstars, 
Spend a hundred grand over by the bar, 
Like Pimpin Aint EZ
Verse 1: (Snoop Dogg): 
Well it aint all them faces in that Laker paint,
Tossing by the lake, make a lil' nigga faint,
Balling is what I does, I anit messing with you can'ts,
Someone can do negro, A real-life California hero,
About six zeros at the end of the number in my bank account,
Nigga aintcha, mad at me I'm so happy to see, 
That you stopped yo life to watch mine, 
Yeah you see it fool,
Snoops everywhere, Itlay I'm heavy there, 
Did a show in Rome like hoes say you ain't ever there,
Talking bout you poppin bottles, I don't see none,
You made it rain where, I don't see a one,
Go on get it off, that's what they like to hear,
Get your money pimp, we don't fight it here,
It's hard enough to be me,
Now trying to be you is something I gota see,
Until then Ima...
Chorus:(R.Kelly)
Pop bottles, shake hands, 
Recognize, I'm the man, 
I tried to tell 'em but they won't understand, 
That Pimpin Aint EZ, 
I got money, I got cars, 
Still fuckin with them hood superstars, 
Spend a hundred grand over by the bar, 
Like Pimpin Aint EZ
Verse 2:(Snoop Dogg)
This aint a joke a loc made it look easy to ya,
I've been through some shit, I made it easy for ya,
Now you aint gota do much, I pop for everybody,
Go on grab a bottle share it with them busy bodies,
Tell her what she want to hear, 
How you would like to take her out of town and shopping here,
And Snoopy is your homie, no no girl he out in here,
He just act like he don't know me when he all up in here,
You a fool jack,
Though I don't condone faking for a bitch,
Don't call it pimpin when you bringing home the bacon to this bitch,
Go on head talk money, talk, look at the chicks,
They raw but know the deal you better flip her like a somersault,
Snoopy never played a role for which he wasn't built for,
Never called somebody friend that I wouldn't kill for,
I do this ballin cause I can, 
Not cause it's cool, I pop cause I'm the man, 
Now watch me and care...
Chorus:(R.Kelly)
Pop bottles, shake hands, 
Recognize, I'm the man, 
I tried to tell 'em but they won't understand, 
That Pimpin Aint EZ, 
I got money, I got cars, 
Still fuckin with them hood superstars, 
Spend a hundred grand over by the bar, 
Like Pimpin Aint EZ
Verse 3:(R. Kelly)
Pimpin in my veins, Pimpin in my blood, 
Pimpin in my swag, Pimpin in my cup,
Walking like I pimp when Im walkin through the club,
Pause like a pimp so the hoes show me love,
Pimp by day, pimp by night,
Them haters made me keep my pimp game tight,
Ya'll the type of fools that make a nigga wanna cut,
Like shots of Patron make a nigga wanna fuck,
But I ain't on that shit so Ima throw my hands up,
And keep it sexy pimpin cause that's how I does,
Uncle Snoop said Kells go hard or go home,
Ya'll hating mother fuckers I'm still here..
Chorus:(R.Kelly)
Pop bottles, shake hands, 
Recognize, I'm the man, 
I tried to tell 'em but they won't understand, 
That Pimpin Aint EZ, 
I got money, I got cars, 
Still fuckin with them hood superstars, 
Spend a hundred grand over by the bar, 
Like Pimpin Aint EZ 
Outro:(R. Kelly):
To all my honeys in the club making money with the thugs, 
Keep it pimpin baby, keep it pimpin baby,
South Side, West Side, East Side, North Side,
Keep it pimpin baby, keep it pimpin baby
