And you think they talkin? 'bout you, you not quite sho'

Norfolik is the gang, extended clip in the jeans
Put 'em in a box like Bisquick, I'm a laker wit clips
Get 'em in the lake wit clips, truth is ya a clipper with clips
Ain't cha bitch, I'm bout my loot and dollars, I'll shot you
For looting dollars but you lootless and dollarless, fuck it

About who you is, the same ol' clique, and the same ol' biz
The same ol flip , wit the same ol whip, the same 4-4, with
The same ol' clip, half the bullets gone, the otha half you can get

We do three quarter drops and we bring a brick back, black
Don't act get ya whole trap splat, ack, unload 'em, reload 'em

Oh, oh, oh, oh, now if a bad bitch wants dick, then it's dick
I give her, Ludacris nigga, I stand and deliver, neva back down
Won't shake nor shiver, fuck with me and get found
In the Chattahoochee River, this seven inch shank will put a stop
To his ticker, but shorties to the body make him drop much quicker
Yeah, I appear to be a nice lil' nigga, fuck with anything I love
I'm a stone cold killa, eating off of 'sace, versace
Sleeping on Chinchilla, eight figga nigga, I'm a multi milla
See me in the street, it can't get no realer, giving back to my hood
With a pocket full of scrilla, my neighbors say', "My house can't
Get no bigga", I do good ass bidness with a bad ass temper, please
Tell ya bitch, stop playing with my zipper or I'll stick her, stick her
