This is Headliner from Arrested Development
And I come here tonight to give thanks to the rain
So brothers and sisters please put down your umbrellas
You won't be needing those today
Look to the clouds with the most rain coming from it
For without the rain there's no me and there's no you
I said a drip-drop, a drip-drop, drip-drop
Viva bum bum bum drip-drop
Let it rain, let it rain, let God's water feed me
The water of life, mentally rinsing me, physically drenching me
Most are frowning upon your arrival but I need you for survival
And when you fall on my community, yeah
I run outside to properly greet you
Let it rain, take my pain, I'm glad to meet you
Fill my eyes with a colorful rainbow
Every drop that hits me fills me with an unmeasurable amount of security
Knowing my God acknowledges me
As if each drop of rain is aimed toward me
My Lord,  thanks for life
Thanks for my rain
My Lord,  thanks for life
Thanks for my rain
It's raining revolution
It's raining solutions
It's raining revolution, it's raining revolution
It's raining revolution, it's raining revolution
It's raining revolution, it's raining revolution
It's raining revolution
I struttle strut thru the ghetto
The rain this time I feel is mental
The goal of this rain I feel is spiritual
Saw thru the eyes of the inflicted people
Their eyes are hard as a million tombstones
Marked with the names of the millions of kin thrown
To the dust that gave them their colored skin
Fade to black is the scene they're embalmed in
The rain many nights have witnessed her
Receiving the sperm of a brother into a sister
And blessed that life to guaranteed existence
A conscious baby for a black resistance
I feel the rain enhances the revolution
And reminds us of a spiritual solution
And reminds us of an unnatural supernatural solu-lu-lution
It's raining revolution, it's raining revolution
It's raining revolution, it's raining revolution
It's raining revolution, it's raining revolution
It's raining revolution, it's raining revolution
It's raining revolution, it's raining revolution
It's raining revolution, it's raining revolution
It's raining revolution, it's raining revolution
It's raining revolution
Lost between reality and psychology
1990's mentality is described by the honorable truth message
Which is 'True Knowledge Is So Priceless' which is so true
Rain, rain, stay here wow
Love that power brothers and sisters
Raise your hands up high
And let me see the colors of your beautiful skin
Now the ceremony begins
Lord, let the heavenly rains cleanse
Run into your nearest rainbow
To grab, hold, to ride on
Each color, learn it
The importance of each color oh yeah
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain, let it rain
Yes let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, oh yeah let it rain, let it rain
Yeah oh let it rain, oh let it rain yeah
