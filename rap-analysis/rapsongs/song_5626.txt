Yeah, one two, one two
Yeah, okay, now
You know who we got up in this bitch
M O, M O B B B
(Boy)
Lil' shorty wop wop
Young thuggin' in the street
Ever front on him
That's how you get popped
(Girl)
Lil' shorty wop wop
Fatty and she hot hot
Young thuggin' in the street
Givin' up the crotch crotch
And we don't give a fuck fuck like you don't give a fuck fuck
Them hammers'll buck buck, ashes ashes dust dust
Death toll addin' up, them razors we let 'em rust
Them haters we clap 'em up, countin' cash, that's us
Catch me in that GT coupe with the flat screen drooped
In the driver's seat souped 'cause it's a Bentley
When I pass by, have you stuck, S U's, black 'em up
Twenty-four black rims, tires gotta fatten up
Whips, go to AutoSport, stash spot, sorta for my mascots
That pop off, buck buck
Sick 'em Fido, let the car idle, I ain't never been there
Shit can happen, have yo' ass disappear in thin air
Shit real, y'all not, get robbed in a car lot
You bitch you call cop, you snitch and that's off top
My biscuit is gonna pop, whether you like it you not
Ever gonna play me, motherfuckers, get shot

We dead serious, you niggaz is livin' jokes
We don't game around, these bullets'll eat through your bones
Ye-ye-yeah, that's right you heard me, nigga, reach for your chrome
When you see us, better bleed us off the top of the dome
Meanin' you better get to squeezin', 'cause our reason is gone
Meanin' that shit is out the window, we won't give it a thought
And we don't give a loud motherfuck 'bout who you are
What's your set that you rep, you can get 'em involved
Is all you hearin' when you go at the Mobb
Is all I'm sayin' if you tryin' to talk
We what you would call
Niggaz that talk it walk it and live it
Your music is not murder, you an infamous mimic
You what we would call, niggaz, who suck dick for a livin'
Get off our balls or we'll take chances for prison
