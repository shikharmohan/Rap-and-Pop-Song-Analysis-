Well, ain't but two kind
Them that do and them that do
Yo, they got tigers, lions and monkeys
But I give my most attention to my donkey
Pay no mind to the sign that said, "Don't feed it"
Even hold it when it's time to get funky
Always tired after two rounds of action
But you got to bust three like Paxon
So you go off and you join the Jerkit Circus
Work it like you knock a bag that's satisfaction
So let's talk about this and that I'm a freaky deak player
But I'm scared that it might be wack, it might hurt my sack
And if it ain't cool then I'm not gonna kiss that cat
'Cuz I don't know where it's been at
Sometimes it ain't cool even when you wear a hat
But yo, I hit it anyway 'cuz a diesel butt female wanted to play
And three days later got an itch and now
I really wanna kill that ho, who did it?
I shouldn't have been with it
I really shouldn't have hit it, did it
But I slipped and I admit it, I did it, hit it
But it didn't have to be done
Next time I'm gonna run run run to the
Jerkit Circus, lay it in your palm and you don't need a condom
Jerkit Circus, gonna get mine and have a nutty nutty time at the
Jerkit Circus, fly girl kinkies work those pinkies at the Jerkit Circus
Baby, hey yo, it's time to milk the cow
Mary goes up and Mary goes down
Mary goes Mary goes 'round and 'round
She rolled on a horse that was wearing a hat
Pop went the ball sack
Mary goes up and Mary goes down
Mary goes, Mary goes 'round and 'round
But this time the horse wasn't wearing no hat
Dead went the ball sack
How did you get strong when she looked at you
And that's how she hooked at you
Sitting in the back when you knew you wasn't strapped
And that's how the microwave cooked you
You rocked and shocked it
Knocked up the booty real good
When you knew you should have
Stopped and blocked it with a hat
I stay strapped 'cuz I'm smarter than that
So let's work, let's work this and let's go to the circus
Tonight he's gonna rock it with a whole new plan
He's got a date with his left hand at the
Jerkit Circus, lay it in your palm and you don't need a condom
Jerkit Circus, gonna get mine and have a nutty nutty time at the
Jerkit Circus, fly girl swingers let me use a finger at the
Jerkit Circus, no more sticking time that we choke that chicken
Mary goes up and Mary goes down
Mary goes Mary goes round and round
She rolled on a horse that was wearing a hat
Pop went the ball sack
Called your girl, tried to get your rocks off
Made you wait, your hard rock got soft
What are you gonna do?
I don't know I wish I knew a better way
'Cuz back in the day, you step to a lot a girls
And they say back off a lot
You get mad wanting tail, jack off a lot
But hey, it's not such a bad idea considering
Don't have to waste a lot a time trying to get her in
The mood and you need no protection
Word to the dick what else it's got is no affection
The sex was great and you didn't have to ball her
And hear her nagging asking you if you was gonna call her
So now I'm going out like a strangler
Get a grip and choke your fa dangler
To the girls that use sex to try to work us
Took my destiny into my own hand and joined the
Jerkit Circus, lay it in your palm and you don't need a condom
Jerkit Circus, yeah, gonna get mine and have a nutty nutty time at the
Jerkit Circus, fly girl swingers learn to use a finger at the
Jerkit Circus, no more sticking time that we choke that chicken
