Exactly what you do
How I fell in love with you
Oh, it's true
Oh, I love you
You showed me how to say
Exactly what you say
In that very special way
Oh, it's true
You fell for me too
And when I tried it
I could see you fall
And I decided
It's not a trip at all
You taught it to me too
Exactly what you do
And now, you love me too
Oh, it's true
We're in love, we two
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Oh oh oh oh oh
We're in love, we two
We two
You showed me how to do

Exactly what you say
In that very special way
You taught it to me too
Exactly what you do
And now you love me too
Now, you love me too
