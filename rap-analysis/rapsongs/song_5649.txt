Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yo, it's like this, man
It's real simple
If my nigga was my nigga like I thought he was
Would he have snitched, hung me out the dry to fuck
Guess you don't know a nigga 'till you catch a case with 'em
It ain't all gravy just because you make cake with 'em
It's real, niggaz scared to death of state prison
To the end when a nigga get caught start snitchin'
Imagine the eyes of a nigga that you knew
For about twenty joints with the nerve to point
Hurt worser than that physical pain
You fed this nigga rolled with the
Sorry, fuck now he switchin' to lame
Niggaz in the box could relate to my pain
All I got is my word and I'ma get you thats my word
Through family friends or even fuckin' your bird
Fuck it anything long as your death occur
Whatever happened to death before dishonor
It's time for your end and it's my honor
(Kill that nigga)
Never wish death
Only if I have to if it's my last option left
  (Kill that nigga)
(Kill that nigga)
Should of kept your mouth tight he's losin' his life

Be locked up or sending out kites
(Kill that nigga)
Never wish death
Only if I have to if it's my last option left
  (Kill that nigga)
(Kill that nigga)
Should of kept your mouth tight he's losin' his life
  (Kill that nigga)
Be locked up or sending out kites
Ay, yo, this nigga runnin', 'round runnin'
His mouth speakin' on the wrong shit
Fuck is this Dave Letterman shit on the late night
Creep on the talk show as
Rap asses get shot in they throat, speak on that
Girlie mouth nigga you worse than a bitch
I done shot niggaz for you put my life at risk
How you gonna go behind me and knife my back
Must be insane and I got a cure for that
My hammer will knock sense in the nigga real quick
Nail a nigga tongue with the four fifth
Nigga you in violation of that code of silence
Niggaz like you get real niggaz indicted
We can't have that, kidnap that bitch
Torture and torment that snitch
We gotta make examples out these hummingbird fucks
Matter of fact pull 'em out the trunk, I'm 'bout to
(Kill that nigga)
Never wish death
Only if I have to if it's my last option left
  (Kill that nigga)
