(Fifty talkin' to someone)
Aight, check this shit out, ya'll niggas gon' stay in the car, I'm'a go
right over here and see somethin', gimme ten minutes, If I don't come
out, ya'll come in, the money stays in the car 'till I say
so.......aiyo, whattup whattup, man, this is what ya'll niggas is
workin' wit' for 22 cents a gram? 
Man, when I come up in here treat me like I'm fam
I could go Uptown and get this shit for 16 cents a gram
bottom line is, man, I gotta cop and go
I got a spot and I can't afford to stop the flow
Poppi, what the fuck is the matter wit' ya Man?
standin' against the wall with a gun in his hand
I ain't on no funny shit I'm on some get this money shit
every four days in PA I move another brick
according to the DA I sold dope in VA
my crew stay in Queens but my plates say VA
I'll show you where I rest at, it aint hard to find me
let me buy a brick and get the other on cossimy
(hey, this life is hard man) I know, don't remind me
If I catch another case I'ma kill Guiliani 
It ain't even safe to sell a pack at night
got task ridin' 'round the Projects on Mountain Bikes
Chorus - 
NY ain't the same, it's OT playa
you can go and cop coke from the corner Bodega
hit the highway and take it to a town near you, and get that money man,
get that money man. (Repeat)
(Fifty Singing)
Now, if you come to 1-3-4 and I'm not around
that means I copped and I went outta town
you mothafukkas know how I get down
about my money man, about my money man.
