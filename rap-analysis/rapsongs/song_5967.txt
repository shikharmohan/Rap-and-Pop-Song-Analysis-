Nas: Yo Yo 
Puffy: Gansta Gansta 
Nas: Gansta Yo 
Puffy: That's Right 
Nas: Journey Through the life of some real niggas 
Puffy: Some real niggas You'll never see what I've seen 
Puffy: 
When I sleep I dream of bodies in streams of blood 
Naked bitches dead niggas ghost 
Feds with toast knockin my door down 
Sweat poor down my body roast from the heat 
So I soak my sheets, wake up shiverin' 
Pull my hoe close to me, she sexy 
Every night is different pussy, since my girl left me 
And I tried to make her stay with me, but I stay busy 
And her friends are cut-throats, they deep throat to lay with me 
I reminise how I missin starin' in space 
Resort to the lips of a stripper, sprayin' that face 
Layin up in a mansion, home alone 
I hear footsteps, shit I kicks just not lyrics 
I hold a fifth, One hundred and ten shots can stop spirits 
If niggas try to rob me, then I won't hear it 
Cause it's different from the streets, I'm missin' my hood now 
Missin' all the blocks, I'm surrounded by woods now 
It's supposed to be good now 
It's like I'm walkin' tight rope and can't look down 
Fire below me 
Now the fantasies I have for women are unholy 
Success, thousand dollar bottles impress 
Models with fat ass and big breats 
Floor seats, Knicks vs. Nets, private jets 
Millionaire heir to Antigua 
With Ananda, the MTV diva 
Nas how do we survive all this mess? 
East vs. West, this rap game 
Where words became flesh 
A whole pound of herb won't desolve my stress 
Still I ride to the death, love hip-hop 
Cause Afrikabababa was def, a lot of respect 
Feel Me? Thug tip from Sean John jury 
I got the same hands of crap platinum and the crap pyramids 
Write about the black experience, sell it to Marimax 
Tell me if you feelin' that 
Chorus- Lil' Kim & Joe Hooker 
Take a journey through the life of these real niggas 
The things that they seen it would thrill niggas 
If you've seen what they've seen, you would wonder 
Through the rain and the pain and the thunder 
By the time you realized that it's goin' down 
You would find yourself going underground 
When we see that this life is upon us 
We would see that there is no one that we can trust 
Beanie Sigel: 
You can never see what I see motherfucker 
Beanie Sigel the realest nigga from the streets was taught 
Stay cased up, nigga stay deep in court 
Reminisin' on that cold cell, deep in thought 
Gettin' skinny, couldn't eat, cause the meat was pork 
Ya'll niggas couldn't live my life, I've been through it 
Streached up in hospital beds, phat fluid 
Two bullets hit my leg, one passed through it 
Saw the blood and the hole in my calf, looked through it 
My life's no joke, I done played dice with Tote 
Upstate for cakes, niggas slice your throat 
We had boxers in the shower, when you gaurd your soap 
I done seen the biggest niggas in the yard get broke 
I done took blocks to war, took blocks ruval 
Took blocks to Wall for box of raw 
What you think the 33 and the glock is for? 
Black fatigues, skullies and binoculars, C4 block your doors 
Niggas can't stop this war 
I show you faggots what the Swatch is for 
Hidding spots in the door for the glocks is for 
Read the paper, '94 I took the cops to war 
Half of ya'll niggas livin' a lie 
The only reason you switchin up Detroit is cause you keep gettin' robbed 
I look that nigga in the eyes before I send him to god 
Beanie Sigel, desert eagle, the realest nigga alive 
Chorus 
Nas: 
Aiyo, Aiyo, Gansta, Gansta 
The Bible as words that Christ wrote, evil men sacrifice goats 
I speek all my life under oath 
Since a kid, troublesome, thrown shit at little girls jumpropes 
Bustin' B-B Guns at stray cats 
That was way back, watched it die, covered in flies 
Then I picked up a stick, try to dig in it's eyes 
Makin' dirt pies, na, being buggied eye shit 
And every other nigga that rap, sound like my shit 
I wear chrome 45's with ice on the grip 
I don't shoot it, I roll with killers and criminals 
With heroin habits they picked up from the penil 
They let you have it, all I do is give them a smile 
Lifestlyes of the realest, you ain't ruthless you bitch 
I got a pine box just your size, I know it'll fit 
Your whole life's a mistake, stop holdin' the pen 
Kill yourself, come back as a man over again 
Cause in this lifetime I'm reignin' , slay men 
Leave your whole body cold 
Your nails grow long, get gray skin 
Made this nigga rest in peace, Amen 
I run with brave men, without the housin', we wilin' 
Names engraved in the pavement 
Brick buildin, grown ladies, jump off the roof 
Nigga get paged, then murdered at the phonebooth 
New York streets made me nigga, it's crazy nigga 
Chorus to fade
