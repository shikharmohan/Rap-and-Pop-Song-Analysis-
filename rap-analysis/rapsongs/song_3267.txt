Thanks to dalyricalmaster@tupac.com for these lyrics. (Threat) What they screamin' when they shout?  We boom you need some elbow room, that's right Who they fiendin' fo' - Zoo rock the house fo' sure Cause I be chokin' the mic, place me under arrest I'm on the hit list baby cause I'm one of the best We on a quest all across the coast to get fresh, yeah, yeah Nigga fly like the air, been up in the game and you can keep the change Tried to smash all the beef, turn the leaf over Still real gangsters don't tell what they do, they just do what they got to Cheap Rock-Rolla, can't be seen, bring your football team Bump your Queen plus we want the chips Spank the white man on his ass with the whip The world is fillin' us, killin' us softly, Adolf Khadafi
