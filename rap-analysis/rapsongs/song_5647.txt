Everything seems, stop, watch is very bling, bling
Nigga wanna swing swing, very much so
But once we get in the air that's a wrap bro
Our songs good to go straight to the radio
Flex easy on the bomb let these niggas hear to flow
We Americas most dangerous to have fans
New York, New York, we the kings of the dam
We party too much and smoke too much grass
And we never see the bright side we only see the bad

Grimy nigga with a gat screamin', "Where the money at?"
My hood Southside, riders ride that's right

Camouflage on the low, ridin' round with the heat

Clip fill till the tip, stunt I get on some shit
