Thats that damn Snoop Dogg again, he aint nothin but a fuckin pimp
[Boy]:
Man snoop you got a bad curve, when i grow up i wanna be just like you

Look here little homeboy, let me tell you somethin,
Don't let me ever hear you say you wanna be like me,

Just don't never let me hear you say you want to be like me,
You hear me?
[Boy]:Yah Huh

and you run on to school
[Boy]:Thanks Snoop.
