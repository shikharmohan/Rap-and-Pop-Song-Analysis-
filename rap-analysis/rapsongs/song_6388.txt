I dedicate this to my world doug strugglers
I hope metafy you with peace and all hustling
I'm busting, for y'all niggas
Cause your my niggas on tha realer
Beground these streets for stacking peeler
For the dealers, save back on your teams
And underrestamate with these who do
You get the paper and then get of the street
Ya'll remember, you'll never give the money and the dope to me
Cause I wont give a shee to a nigga starvin
So we can fluss and blow weed hangin' with the warden
How many niggas on the quad who don't giva a fuck
Survivin struggls hiting licks out the hippieclub
I'm just a homie out the hood who did something
So why are you fronting
I'm in for ten years and I'll still wanted
You heard me homie!
Or do you try to tell it to the dumdums
They call you niggas
And niggas try steel were they come from
I bring the front to all my homies out riding
Help a homie get on his feet, and we'll all riding
Sange, and fange in this game, but it's true
Be sure that you'll respecting the power, and that's you
Never forget the neighbourhood were it started
The ghette south eight is my hood and my hearts with the...

I represent the southeast, of southeast
Millenium muthafucka and kay-doo were ya at
(one time) bring tha rockas
Cause muthafuckas being talkin' for so long
But now I'm down with the innerface clik and it's on
Give a fuck were you're from nigga
And kay-doo always represtentin
That nigga is a fact I've lived in it
Now look at me, y'all can't steel rabbit
For all y'all niggas talking that shit, I'm still strapping
Will I strapp ya? 
Niggas with all that hot capit
Niggas packin' in fake and it ain't happning
Will you think we're smacking
That yellow road is steady packing
The home of the ghetto slangin
And car jacking
Nigga, I ain't acting
I was brought up in this bitch
From the o.p's and all down to the eastwike
Even flat joe's and even the lingwood is all hood
For the christ your all driving is all hood
The ghetto

Ice cube:
I got give it up to my ghetto niggas
In the ghetto, bitch, looking forthem ghetto licks
Geting ghetto rich
Knowing that the steam in the book flip the gang
Quick to get my telephone turned on in my mama's name
This ghetto slang is some shit thatcan beat collage,
You ain't fucking with this hustla with street knolledge
9 to 5
Still fliping twenties on the side
Try to get by the feints
I'm making dollars out of fifty cents
Got the big body benz, with the wheels on it
A celuarphone with no bills on it
Get your ass on this, got to fill on, still want it
Baby, leen on it, and I can put the kill on it
You gotot strap a nigga lie like a singer
Puting your baby to sleep
And turn of your ring and you can catch me on banewick
Looking sick in a six
And some schweiz on my wrist
Now picture this
You got to blow, cause to many niggas out for mr. jackson's dope
Ya'll niggas got to go, to the ghetto
Chorus:
Ghetto,
Ghetto.
I can't get out of here

Deathwall is the site
When the mic be light
As twice as shipp advice to my homies who write me in te pine
Now the sale is hell but kids keep sending me mail
With their laberty bell, so I can tell you about the half
And who got cow for riches, and sending bithces,
I'm making bitches
I remember when I just to get beat with extensioncars
And we slanged by to see were my house was
Started stealing out of my mama's perce
Now that she's gone
She lives thrue my songs
And it sure hurts
I couldn't have treated her worse then in the ghetto
And turn our womens into wideows
Sick to see my homie that I ain't with, trade with, payed with, laughed with
Dead in a casket.
To my pumps we can reach the top
But you got a chance to get of the pop
If you see your chance baby take it
I was the last mothafucka in the world who thoiught I would make it
But look at me now, a six on the beach in greeze
Check from the muthafucka stretts of the ghetto
Chorus:
Ghetto,
Ghetto.
I can't get out of here
Ghetto
Nigga
Ghetto
I can't get out of here
