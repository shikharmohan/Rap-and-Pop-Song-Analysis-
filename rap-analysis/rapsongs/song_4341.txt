Hehe But i neva take a break
I neva take a break till I see heaven on the gates
I stick that metal in your face
And now they call you chrome face
Fuck with me better bring your lunch cause it gonna be a long day
Fuck what you heard like my dick against your eardrum.
Swagger so sharp weezy where you get the spear from
I can make you the son your momma neva hear from
let the tough talk walk and watch how your fear run.
Yea, and fuck the world is my assignment
And I promise your gonna be feel me like blind men
Roll or roll over like front wheel alignment
Tell them little rappers dont come near the giant
UGH.. now im smell'n myself
Flow sicker than shit where the hell is my health
Start'n to feel like Mac Avelly myself
Watch I put that mothafucken Mac 11 to your scalp
Yes my Maybach i swear the bitch a donkey
Had to get the long body cause the chauffer didnt want me
Mothafucka im ill. Hold me still
Greedy, thats why my first week i got a meal

Pull up and shoot like JJ Reddick
Put on my boot i think im ready
Which one of you niggas? One of you get it
Keep your head up or your beheaded. Uh-Oh
Fearless is my middle name my heart pump nitrogen
And I breath fire better stand by a hydrogen
Dufflebag big enough to fit the rifle in
I cut your ass short, call me hyphen bitch

Stay cool, but smokin like a cigarette
Its the President, sittin behind a bigger desk
Secretary with bigger breasts
Handing me bigger checks
Im going at these niggas necks
