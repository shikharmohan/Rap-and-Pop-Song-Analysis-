I'm Not Human Lyrics
I am not a human being
[Verse 1:]
Re, Re, Reporting from anotha world
Look up in the sky and see me porting with a cova girl
She know that is fly after I'm through then it's anotha girl
I can make your wife and your sister fuck your brother girl
Rock Star Biotch
Check out how we rock
And if this ain't Hip Hop
It must be Knee Hop
I'm higher then a mothafuckin chronic leaf tree top
I make da nina sing like "shoot a du dee wap"
You want the facts daddy? well I truly do need pop
And I get my candy from your girlfriend's sweet shop
Still get a stomach ache every time I see cops
You better run motherfucker, Cause we not
Yeah you bitches better run til your feet stop
And I'm so, fed up with street cops
I'm colder than a ski shop
I'm holdin' on to the top
And even if I let go
I still wanna G rock
[Chorus:]
I am the Rhyming Oasis
I got a cup of ya time I won't waste it
I got my foot on the line I'm not racin'
I thank god that I am not basic
I am not a human being
[Verse 2:]
Haha
Rock Star Baby
Now come to my suite and get lock jaw baby
I can knock your boots and your socks off baby
News flash ya boyfriend a knock off baby
Ok, Real shit he can get knocked off baby
I'm like a champagne top I'm ready to pop off baby
You really lucky I don't kill if it's not for baby
Got so much money, I can look at the cops all crazy
Rock star shit for my rock star ass
Got a tub full of money that's a rock star bath
Then I use more money to wipe my rock star ass
Then I throw it in the garbage that rock star trash
I wouldn't try you
I wouldn't lie dude
I must be sticky cause them bitches got they eyes glued
Beep beep bitch I'm so motherfuckin da mu
Starin' at a mountain like "Bitch I will climb you! "
I stand tall like I'm motherfucking 9? 2?
I scream motherfuck you and who ever designed you
And if you think you hot then obviously you were lied to
And we don't die we multiply and then we come divide you
[Chorus:]
I am the Rhyming Oasis
I got a cup of ya time I won't waste it
I got my foot on the line I'm not racin'
I thank god that I am not basic
I thank god that I am not basic
I am not a human being
[Verse 3:]
Ughh
I'm rockstar Bad
With my rock star glasses and my rockstar plaid
The school of hard rock I'm a rockstar grad
And my kids, are bout to have a rockstar dad
Now momma let them titties bounce like rocks off glass
And if you do I probably call ya like shots off glass
Don't jump into my water cause your knot won't last
I swear I'm a be like a shark that rocked on bass
Rock star life
Rock star Bright
And in the mosh pit is how a rockstar fight
So jump in this bitch and catch a rockstar right
And the cops could never violate a rockstars rights
Yea, now I'm back on my grizz
And yalls a bunch of squares like a muthafuckin grid
And errybody get it, well me I get rid
Of he who say he get it, and then I get his
No marquee but this is big Biz
And I scream fuck it, whoever it is
Ain't no muthafucka deeper than me bitch dig
And I thank god everyday that my children are rich kids
[Chorus:]
I am the Rhyming Oasis
I got a cup of ya time I won't waste it
I got my foot on the line I'm not racin'
I thank god that I am not basic
I am not a human being
