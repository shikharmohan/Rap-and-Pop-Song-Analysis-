Hard days of work, you had a hard day at work baby
I want you to sit down, relax while I soak you in my mental
Back rub style, watch this, yo, yo
Massage, peppermint oil, shampoo and pears
Cinnamon, aloe, natural for you hair
So lather the soap, coconut conditioning
Honey lather, blood flowing, love glistening
Motion lotion, breeze, over the ocean
Lovers, bath crystals, lovers bun scrubbers
Hot milk bath, steam shower rubbing
These will splash long loving in your oven
Make it off, break it off, till it gets soft
Passion fruit, pussy cat, want to touch it off
In and out, rapers patients, Hershey's Kisses get a style
Stress reliever soak your feet, air them out
Brain message, think about pink
Stress relieving, no dishes in the sink
Upper lower, left, right, neck don't play
Back rub, count on, take me away
Waterfall beads, streams, plush and lavish
Come with me through all the damn madness
Night breeze at sea, sipping tea you and your queen melodies
And trees, 85 degrees, jet skis breeze
Scraping water on chocolate, butter scotch flowers
Vapor action, tropical sun shower
Baby powder, relax, feel for an hour
Sand suntan, snuggled up snug
Snowy days, fireplace, oriental rug
Thugs, lay on the couch, pull it out, perfect balance
Chemical stimuli, two tokes off the chalice
Complete silence, what surround us
What's the finest, wrapped in cold sheets
Vanilla apple heat, loop played jazz music, coffee pillow sleeps
Breakfast in bed, early morning sun treats
Sunset level, surprise sunrises, hell
Lay on the couch, while I clip your toenails
Dreams of peaches and cream steam secret spells
Soft spoken gospel, Barry White Capella
Violin, good medicine, sound swell
Sunshine like, the right, without the hell
Taste sugar, wise storm steam stick
Slow dance drink, like nights over Egypt
Having, stabbing, calm chilling now we rolling
Company, ice cream licking now we holding
Gentle force, warm tingle of the golden
Open loose, ice cubes, kiss your belly
Alcohol, palm trees, peanut butter jelly
Almond twirl, fantastic melodies
Soon, taste these spoons
Wiping me with ton, fly wine, prize storm
Now it's high noon, raspberry spices
Cherry breath, drink from the mountain, sip the very best
Sounds of the shore, every winter is a war
Paradise life, recipe now pour
Musician, model, gentle mental
Wash away your sorrow, fantasy Allah
Put the message in the bottle
Carry you through, the threshold, do my duty
Happy ending, go to rest Sleeping Beauty
Yo, this is that body shop shit, love, love slam
Edible underwear, champagne, bubble bath
Have your snack on that ass that know what I mean?
Massaging these melodies put that gangsta shit on the shelf
Blow winds, blow, through your hair
Sea breeze sticks and shit, right, right
When your around boo
Come and chop this mother fucking beat
You stank ass trick
