Uh, c'mon, uh, yo, yo
Niggas, they drug her up like liquid
How she dish shit
Man, woman, boy and girl got addicted
Damn she flipped it, when gone they missed it
Been on 'cuz, they can't stop her climb
Nigga, you digs it?
Want that?
Well you can keep that
'Cuz other bitches out there whack, but you can't see that
Eve is top notch, I had to spot watch
To make sure I made it mine
'Cuz you can't cock block, came up
Fucked the game up
Now your record sales is weak, but you can't blame us
'Cuz none can tame us, the game'll never drain us
'Cuz we gonna stop your shine
And it remains us
It's all good, you takin' everything sweet
But it's the problems and the pressure that they can't see
I'm tryin to make a quick flip
Nigga, can you dig this?
Shit is real, make a mill forever be that rich bitch

They callin' me a savage
'Cuz I gotta have it
I aint work this hard not to ball and live lavish
And let some clown take my shine like I aint workin' overtime
I refuse to fuck up, and lose my place I got in line, huh
Bitch please
Erased your name with ease
And it was nothin', caught you stuntin' got no room to breathe
Only into big things
All day spit game
Tryin to put my people up on paper before shit change
I be up, late night
Tryin to get my papes right
After every show, I gotta go, I got a late flight
Thought they had us figured out
'Cuz we pullin' figures out
Not that bitch, who is she and what's that nigga swizz about?
Questions start to come about
Thought my time was runnin' out
But never 'cuz I'm better under pressure, guess you figured out
Stop all the dumb shit
I came to run, shit
Think I'm leaving, not at all I'm havin to much fun, shit

Yo niggas must be buggin' out
The industry we dug it out
We always keep it gangsta'
We change what y'all be talkin' about
Some get away with bullshit
But they the ones who drown quick
Back on the block, hustlin', scrapin' money up to buy a brick
Too late, 'cuz it's over now
