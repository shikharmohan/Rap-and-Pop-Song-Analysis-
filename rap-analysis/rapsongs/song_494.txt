Bizzy:
See, they donÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ° understand me. IÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ³e been through him, and him, and him, and then 
come at ÃÂ¦Ã¢Â¦ÃÂ¹m again. I know niggas thatÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ¯ in the pen, and figgas for you and them. 
Evil creepinon my people. Chances are slim. Be married to the music. Boom! Hit 
the stage, ready to die for it, cry for it. Cut the games. Many tried for it, 
lied for it, get a catchy chorus and fly for it. Take orbit, let gravity be 
your fortress tonight. Elevate your brain, hold your heart and just sing, ÃÂ¦Ã¢Â¦ÃÂ¶ause 
gracefully we age through all the pain. Sentiments in rain. Evidence of itÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ¯ 
heavenly fangs distained for my explanation on ÃÂ¦Ã¢Â¦ÃÂ¶ane. The fame was the sum of 
our money, chained in a murder, murder shame, with a pistol and a pissed-off 
bang! Well, then let me finish with thug love. IÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ¦ off to hit the club with the 
bud and the track, hit the mud. Keep the gun, itÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ¯ my first love.
Tell me what you see, you see ... If you look into my eyes.
Supervision:
IÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ¦ making love to my music, my music. My music makes me high.

Supervision:
IÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ¦ making love to my music, like my musicÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ¯ my lady. Sippinon Brandi, 
intoxicated. Humminto __. And iÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ¦ chillinwith Krayzie, and we high off that 
Thai. My reasonÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ¯ why, like R. Kelly, I believe I can fly. And plus, around me I 
canÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ° see, my visionÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ¯ clouded. Premeditate ÃÂ¦Ã¢Â¦ÃÂ¹m or bust, and please label me ÃÂ¦Ã¢Â¦'out 
it, ÃÂ¦Ã¢Â¦'out it. As I collect my thoughts, take me a breath. God bless my homie 
[insert name], he took one in the chest. And yes, but he still here to rap a 
song, just another day. While ya bullshhhhh, crack the top on that Alize! ÃÂ¦Ã¢Â¦Ãause 
we donÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ° play in this land of the locÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ¯, where brothers, they smoke trees up with 
dust, and see, they bleed. Then they plead. ÃÂ¦Ã¢Â¦Ãuase iÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ¦ on top, straight ballin 
Makinlove to my woman, but my musicÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ¯ steady callin and never stallin But it 
comes to me, you should please let me have prophecy, yes, I make love to my 
music. IÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ¦ makinlove ...
Krayzie:
I love music. Any kind of music, as long as itÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ¯ pumpinto keep me thuggin self 
in check. Maintain the mentality I got to keep my composure, and musicÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ¯ the 
perfect potion. When iÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ¦ coastinroll a blunt up, roll ÃÂ¦Ã¢Â¦ÃÂ¹m up. Put some of them 
jams on. And, nigga, we zonein so put on some old school, homie, letÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ¯ hit the 
dance floor. Music really makes me happy. When iÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ¦ stressin mental hot, I put 
on some instrumentals. Stop, I think about what I done been through. I put it 
to paper, then put it to wax, and kick some facts, sit back and relax, now 
everything is all right. If it wasnÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ° for this music, iÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ½ be dead, fuck a jail, ÃÂ¦Ã¢Â¦ÃÂ¶
ause a nigga ainÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ° never goinback to that hell. Feel me. Kill me. And if it 
wasnÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ° for the man upstairs blessing me with talent, like the average thug 
nigga, would I vanish? But this platinum got us niggas established. Got us 
living lavish. Apply yourself, survival tactics, nigga, and yÃÂ¦ÃÂ Ã¢Â¹ll can have it. 
Even though itÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ¯ stress and strain in the game, one thing I canÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ° do is ... Is 
stop the music.

Layzie:
Nigga, it don't stop, and it won't stop ÃÂ¦Ã¢Â¦ÃÂ¶ause i just can't quit. This game be 
runninthrough my veins with nothinbut platinum hits. And nigga it don't stop, 
ÃÂ¦Ã¢Â¦ÃÂ¶ause it won't stop, ÃÂ¦Ã¢Â¦ÃÂ¶ause it just don't quit. This game be runninthrough my 
veins with nothinbut platinum shit. Nigga I gotsta have it. ItÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ¯ like automatic 
rounds when I put this down. Constantly fuckin up instrumentals, you remember 
that thuggish ruggish sound. You can feel the love goin through the speakers, 
creepin livinlife on the deep end. Better believe you wonÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ° catch me sleepin 
put up a beat and I heat, dismiss the flames. Nigga, cut the games, me and my 
music we sleep and eat together. We hop in the Benz, get off in the winds, and 
we run the streets together. And we on a mission to stick up the industry full 
throttle. Mo Thugs, mo money the motto, so, nigga, the slugs that I bring come 
hollow. Nigga we can do this in the song, or nigga we can do this in person. 
Whatever you do when you cross the gunline boss, little Lay'll be puttinhis 
work in. ÃÂ¦Ã¢Â¦Ãause me and my music, nigga, we don't take that shit. Nigga, put the 
pen to the pad, get mad and I break that bitch. Nigga, it's just the thug in 
me, mixed up with the indo and the OlE. When I drop this thugsta poetry, I 
make all y'all know who the fuck I be, niggas!
