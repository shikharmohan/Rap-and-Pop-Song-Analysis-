Sometimes I wish I had three different faces 
I'm going to court for three cases in three places 
One in Queens Manhattan one in Brooklyn 
The way things is looking I'm 'ma see central bookings 
Facing 3 3 to 9 is mad time 
After reconcurrence for assault 2 9 
I gotta maintain 'cause stress on the brain 
Can lead to a mothefucka suicide thing 
And plus my provation a ill violation 
How the fuck did I get in this tight situation? 
I'm going all out you know moves I never fake 
And fuck the jake digger catch me at my way 
And if I did burn a bag of blade 
Put the light in the air sometimes I just don't care 
[Prodigy] 
Son I got plans, power movements, get on some real shit 
I keep living like this I might loose it 
My man is coming home from doing long ass bids 
What up Kiko? I ain't seen your ass since we was kids 
It's all strange my nigga's locked down thinking long range 
And see their names in the Daily news third page 
They sent a kite to my nigga Killa 
It only took one sword to put seven holes in his squila 
A 3 to 9 spending most of his time inside the bin 
Reclined, and still came home with a shine
