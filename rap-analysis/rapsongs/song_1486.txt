Plug one, plug two, plug one, plug two
Plug one, plug two, plug one
Tell me what's more essential
Rap lines, party past nine
Or reading which is fundamental
Tell me what's more pollution
Black fog, burning log
Or infested prostitution
Tell me what's more appealing
Fast food job, corn on the cob
Or interstate drug dealing
Tell me what's more tantalizing
Flip flop, skeezer lies and props
Or 'Three Feet High And Rising'
Tell me, what's more?
Tell me what's more demanding
A dominant race, a fad called base
Or peace and understanding
Tell me what's more neglected
Teaching our seeds the fact there's greed
Or words being said in a record
Tell me what's more pathetic
A lallygag lush, a habit to cuss
Or a lawsuit filed on a medic
Tell me what's more amusing
Comic strip or break that hip
Or what Prince Paul's producing
Tell me, what's more?
Tell me what's more old-fashioned
Lemonade, a black man's fade
Or a kiss that's soaked in passion
Tell me what's more secretive
Love looks, a diary book
Or the De La style us speakers give
Tell me what's more off-tempo
Wearing pink, a fizzy Lipton drink
Or a brother with acne and dimples
Tell me what's more confusing
A Rubik's cube, a dusted dude
Or a figure in which one is choosing
Tell me, what's more?
Yo Pos and Dove, stand clear to be plugged up
Ah, the hell with that, I don't have time for playin' with this
Just tell me what's going on
I just wanna know what's going on
Go ahead, Pos and Dove
Tell me what's going on
I just wanna know what's happening man
Ah, you won't tell me what's going on
I'd just like to say what's up to the Jungle Brothers
I'd like to say what's up to the Quest
I'd like to say what's up to Monie
I'd like to say what's up to Latifah
Mike G in the house [Incomprehensible]
Prince Paul, hey what's up man?
I'm cool and this is P.A. Mase and I just want to say
Cool DJ Red Alert, what's up, man?
Okay, we outta here, all right, peace y'all
[Incomprehensible]
