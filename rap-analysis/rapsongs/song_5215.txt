Expect the unexpected, motherf***er, let's go, come on
Yeah, M E F, ha, ha, ha, ha, special guest
  (F*** you, f*** you, f*** you, f***)
Ha, ha, ha, ha, yeah
Yo, you don't wanna ride with Dirt, you still stuck in coach
You don't wanna fly in first, yo, I can spit
One verse and leave in a new Benzer
Take a trip down south and put some h**s to work, you hear me
Dirt McGirt, you n****z gon' respect it
I'm drunk and crunk so don't come in my direction
I'm ready to thump and get the whole crew arrested
Bail 'em out and laugh about it in Texas, yo
And get with Rome, down in Caki-Lac
And hit the spot, in the hood where the happenings at
Where the shootin' and the fightings, and the stabbings at
Where the Lincolns and the Chevys, and the Cadi's at, s***
Them down south n****z been loved Dirt
Take a shot to the head, if you been through the worse
Show respect to your n****z, who been doin' it first
And be comin' with that s***, I'm just doin' the worse
Yo, you don't wanna ride with Dirt, you still stuck in coach
You don't wanna fly in first, yo, I can spit, yo
You don't wanna ride with Meth, we still sniffing c****
Even if you tried your best, yo, I can spit
Yo, you don't wanna ride with Dirt, you still stuck in coach
You don't wanna fly in first, yo, I can spit, yo
You don't wanna ride with Meth, we still sniffing c****
Even if you tried your best, yo, I can spit
Damn, I'm just like Dirt in the booth
I'm the truth, I don't need to go to church in a suit
Each verse is the proof, I drink a 100 Proof
Cop searching the coup, I got some herb in my boot
When Wu is coming through, the outcome, critical
F***ing with this style, the outcome get physical
Meth get lyrical, and y'all can get my g*******
Don't forget them aid essentials, vitamins and minerals
Heh, ya'meen, I'm taking one for the team
Like Martin Luther King, taking one for a dream
I'm dope, too many fiends, live by many means
If you don't stand for nothing, you'll fall for anything
That's real s***, let's get this money real quick
Dirt Dog, I'm feeling this but I'd rather feel rich
I mean filthy rich, I'm corporate now
Big Meth, the label's Def that's why I talk so loud, n****
Yo, you don't wanna ride with Dirt, you still stuck in coach
You don't wanna fly in first, yo, I can spit, yo
You don't wanna ride with Meth, we still sniffing c****
Even if you tried your best, yo, I can spit
Yo, you don't wanna ride with Dirt, you still stuck in coach
You don't wanna fly in first, yo, I can spit, yo
You don't wanna ride with Meth, we still sniffing c****
Even if you tried your best, yo, I can spit
F*** you, f*** you, f*** you, f*** you
F*** you, f*** you, f*** you, f***
F*** you, f*** you, f*** you, f*** you
F*** you, f*** you, f*** you, f*** you
