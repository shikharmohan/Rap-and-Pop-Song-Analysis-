I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pimpin' down the ave you know I'm lookin' tight
These jealous niggas looking at me and my car so shife
Wanna take my life, and wanna jack, but I see all through that
Never let these bitch niggas take what's mine nigga never do that
Who's says he's going through a thang
When ya'll ain't never lied
I gotta a baby but it's momma act like he ain't mine
Wicked women using children to live on
When I hurt and try to hate 'cause she knows the thrill is gone
Say man, I stop smokin' with haters back in ninety four
But niggas thinkin' that a sweeps gone get the through my door
And niggas talk alot of shit in a safe place
I know 'cause he can't look me eye to eye when he in my face
Now nigga listen to my thesis, see just what I mean
Nigga I ride dirty everyday, but still I shine so clean
Glitter and gleam, and all what it look like
So I keep swangin' I hear clanging tryin' to live my life
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood.
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood.
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm, I'm, I'm pushin' down the ave
I see these niggas and days go and come
And fo me just to wake, I'm know I'm pissed
I grab my cis and I split my sista with my bunk
Some of my sweets be tight
And some of my sweets be fucked up
But all of my sweets gonna blow so killas smoke get sucked up
I looked up today and didn't fall prey to none of that pistol play
But who is to say tomorrow they won't be blastin' this away
I'm puffin' spliffs of hay still upset about the drama here
At this time of year I'm wipin' away
My dead homey momma's tear shit
But naturally them fuckin' laws is always after me
So I have to be in that matter on that 503
I'm livin' dastardly
Must be all about survival G
These niggas passin' me streets just keep on gettin' live with me
They say there has to be another way but I ain't feelin' that
They try to steal a lad, and my wig they wanna peel it back
But still the fact remains
It's all about the game swangin' bang
Peace to ESG and all the victims of the game
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood.
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm, I'm, I'm pushin' down the ave
I'm pimpin' through the ave. tryin' to see some good
But everythang is still the same in my neighborhood
Niggas frown, when you up and smile when you down
And when you change for the better shife fools stop comin' around
I see the jealousy and hate, the wicked ways
We all lost children, pray for papers, and smokin' our lives away
Got to the point where I could not decipher day from night
She say she love me but all we do now is fuck 'n' fight
My conscience fuck with me so much I can't eat or sleep
The other side is sellin' dope and out there runnin' the streets
And even though I'm gay to street fame comin' from this rap game
Lust for thankin' and compulsive drankin' is a normal thang
Some get a waste and misplace tryin' to win the race
Some try to hold on to there place by smokin' with lace
But see drugs and plastic thugs ain't gonna change the hood
I'm smokin' skunk and poppin' the truck to make me feel good
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
I'm pushin' down the ave no one lookin' good
I'm baggin' stones niggas diamonds up against that wood
So it's your life
