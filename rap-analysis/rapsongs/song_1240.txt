You never know
I just might die tonight, so let's get high tonight
Might try to fight, some mothers cry tonight
Cig' in my right hand 'cause you hold tight to life
But you ain't a bright man
You never know
I just might die tonight, so let's get high tonight
Might try to fight, some mothers cry tonight
Cig' in my right hand 'cause you hold tight to life
But you ain't a bright man, you never know
You know I live with the biggest hitters
Crime committers and bull shitters
Never had a quitter come with us
Who had the jitters since some bitter tasting minute
I spit it for those who did it
Like a soldier so committed to winning from me
(You never know)
Who you running with nigga
Who you gunning with, who you thugging with
In times of struggle shit
Never be blinded by diamonds, they signin' for weak nigga
No sign of loyalty in anything you speak
(You never know)
You're breakable, celebrated but capable
Celebrated but fadable, you're biodegradable
You just might die tonight
Get out of my sight
'Cause you ain't even know there's your fight
You never know
I just might die tonight, so let's get high tonight
Might try to fight, some mothers cry tonight
Cig' in my right hand 'cause you hold tight to life
But you ain't a bright man
You never know
I just might die tonight, so let's get high tonight
Might try to fight, some mothers cry tonight
Cig' in my right hand 'cause you hold tight to life
But you ain't a bright man, you never know
I been through the scandal
And handled them better than other vandals
Hearing insane rambles, saying that life's a gamble
Praying for just a sample in amble times
To trample, example
Enemies who shit they need a pamper
(You never know)
Every thug, nigga living his life
Giving his life meaning
Haters in the wings, they feeling their pride stinging
We here, death knocking, it's shocking
We keep it popping homey
We never stopping, we keeping all you bitches dropping homey
(You never know)
And you people are evil, believe me
I can see through and he got an evil intent
I'm gonna see to him
I think you all got the message, it's a hard lesson
Yo aye, you go to pray to God stressing
You never know
I just might die tonight, so let's get high tonight
Might try to fight, some mothers cry tonight
Cig' in my right hand 'cause you hold tight to life
But you ain't a bright man
You never know
I just might die tonight, so let's get high tonight
Might try to fight, some mothers cry tonight
Cig' in my right hand 'cause you hold tight to life
But you ain't a bright man
You never know
I just might die tonight, so let's get high tonight
Might try to fight, some mothers cry tonight
Cig' in my right hand 'cause you hold tight to life
But you ain't a bright man
You never know
I just might die tonight so let's get high tonight
Might try to fight, some mothers cry tonight
Cig' in my right hand 'cause you hold tight to life
But you ain't a bright man, you never know
Amen
