You thought I was the one, but I got my own whips
Own chips own crib and I don't need this shit here
You thought I was the one, to be dependin' on you
I'm a independent woman, I'm sorry homie that you
You thought I was the one, to just settle for promises
That you never kept thought I would fail but you won't 'cause
You thought I was the one, but you been proven false
The truth is you lost, I pay the cost to do what ever I want, yeah
He, thought I was virgin Mary sweet as a nun
Wanted to marry me with hopes I'd carry his son
Or his daughter the thought I gotta stay out of the parties
Stay in the house, be lonesome, and talk to nobody
Be cooped up for the longest, with nothin' but time
Misery loves company but it ain't no friend of mine
I cooked and cleaned like a Hebrew slave, till I got blisters
A modern day Miss Celie, and he was my mister
But I woke up one day, started to get real slick
Called a couple of my friends with a few scenarios
Felt like a dance with the devil, didn't like being happily
Married no more had to go real quick, 'cause it's my time
And I done made up my mind Shawntae gotta leave you behind
And get my dough 'cause half of that's mine
And my drow to help me the daughter sunshine
You thought I wouldn't make it but I'm livin' proof
Do on to others as you'd have motherfuckers do on to you
You thought I was the one, but I got my own whips
Own chips, own crib and I don't need this shit here
You thought I was the one, to be dependin' on you
I'm a independent woman, I'm sorry homie that you
You thought I was the one, to just settle for promises
That you never kept, thought I would fail but you won't 'cause
You thought I was the one, but you been proven false
The truth is you lost, I pay the cost to do what ever I want, yeah
She, was my ace boon coon in high, we grew up together
You fucked with her I'd fight you, and vice versa
From class to choir rehearsal, totin' the bags
Slangin' them sacks, and beat up all the hood rats
Rolling off with the richest niggas on the block
And bring they whips back, but things changed
When I started to rap, jealousy kicked in
She wouldn't be my friend, she wasn't even lookin' out for me
Then, she didn't even have time to call me on the phone
To say hello so good-bye, good-bye
You'll never get apiece of my love again
Don't try, my love is everlasting like Tony Terry
I'm very territorial and I'm over protective to niggas
I love, 'cause I respect them, but not this heffa
She took things in a different direction
I can't protect her when it's said and done, shit
I am not the one, I need loyal buddies, supportive of me
Roarin' for me, breakin' my trust can get ugly
So please don't mistake my kindness for weakness
Learn it, as I stomp trough the trenches on this tedious journey
I'm so hot my feet burn, and you keep yearnin'
To be a part of my life but you done fucked it up permanently
Now it don't concern me no more
You thought I was the one, but I got my own whips
Own chips, own crib and I don't need this shit here
You thought I was the one, to be dependin' on you
I'm a independent woman, I'm sorry homie that you
You thought I was the one, to just settle for promises
That you never kept, thought I would fail but you won't 'cause
You thought I was the one, but you been proven false
The truth is you lost, I pay the cost to do what ever I want, yeah
Sena I thought that I was the one
Sena I thought, you thought that I was the one
Thought I was the one
Thought I was the one, yeah
You thought I was the one, but I got my own whips
Own chips, own crib and I don't need this shit here
You thought I was the one, to be dependin' on you
I'm a independent woman, I'm sorry homie that you
You thought I was the one, to just settle for promises
That you never kept, thought I would fail but you won't 'cause
You thought I was the one, but you been proven false
The truth is you lost, I pay the cost to do what ever I want, yeah
