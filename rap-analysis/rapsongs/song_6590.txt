As I look up at the sky, my mind starts trippin'
A tear drops my eye, my body temperature falls
I'm shakin' and they breakin' tryin' to save the dogg
Pumpin' on my chest and I'm screamin'
I stop breathin, damn I see demons
Dear God, I wonder, can You save me?
I can't die Boo-Boo's 'bout to have my baby
I think it's too late for prayin', hold up
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started sayin'
"Bring your lifestyle to me I'll make it better"
"And how long will I live?", "Eternal life and forever"
"Or will I be, the G that I was?"
"I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dreamed of
So relax your soul, let me take control, close your eyes my son"
"My eyes are closed"
Murder, murder was the case that they gave me
Murder, murder was the case that they gave me
Murder, murder was the case that they gave me
Murder, murder was the case that they gave me
I'm fresh up out my coma
I got my momma and my daddy and my homies in my corner
It's gonna take a miracle they say
For me to walk again and talk again but anyway
I get, fronted some keys to get back on my feet
And everything that nigga said, came to reality
Livin' like a baller loc
Havin' money, and blowin' hella chronic smoke
I bought my momma a Benz, my Boo-Boo a Jag
And now I'm rollin' in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rad
"Just remember who changed your mind
'Cuz when you start set-trippin', that ass' mine"
Indeed, agreed proceed to smoke weed
Never have a want, never have a need
They say I'm greedy but I still want mo'
'Cuz my eyes wanna journey some more, really doe
Check it out
Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die, before I wake, I pray the Lord, my soul to take
Murder was the case that they gave me
Murder was the case that they gave me
Murder was the case that they gave me
No more indo, gin and juice
I'm on my way to Chino, rollin' on the gray goose
Shackled from head to toe
25 with an izzl, with nowhere to gizzo, I know
Them niggaz from the other side recognize my face
'Cuz it's the O.G. D O double G, L B C
Mad doggin' niggaz 'cuz I don't care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggaz stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level 3 yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scrapin' on the floor
Niggaz gettin' they shanks, just in case the war, pops off
'Cuz you can't tell what's next
My little homey baby boo took a pencil in his neck
And he probably won't make it, to see twenty-two
I put that on my momma, I'ma ride for you baby boo
Murder, murder was the case that they gave me
Murder, murder was the case that they gave me
Murder, murder was the case that they gave me
Murder, murder was the case that they gave me
