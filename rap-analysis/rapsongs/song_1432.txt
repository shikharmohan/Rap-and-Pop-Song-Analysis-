Never gonna give up on you
We gonna do it like this
Just a little bit
Like that, just a little bit
Zhane, just a little bit
De La, just a little bit, c'mon
I'll never give you up
No, I'll never stop
Keep it comin'
Keep on comin' 4 more
I'll never give you up
No, I'll never stop
Keep it comin'
Keep on comin' 4 more
It's that brown man from long islandin' shores
Got a way with women, so I get away with yours
Because you're whole game's outdated
Which leaves all the pretty women heavily sedated
Mummy you can play your 'Ripley's' or 'Believe It Or Not'
I shoot gift like heron with skills of Gil Scott
Nights like Sir Lancelot can get heated
Prescribin' your vibe, love, I know how you need it
I'll never give you up
No, I'll never stop
Keep it comin'
Keep on comin' 4 more
I'll never give you up
No, I'll never stop
Keep it comin'
Keep on comin' 4 more
I like to mingle sometimes so I head out of state
To find a couple of dimes but a government rate
Can't settle for no nickels, even pennies for thought
For short, I need connections with big bank selections
Securing all the sections with sing-sing corrections
Seedin' like nature, escapin' like gas
Tell me how long this love is gonna last
Thinkin' fast might spoil somethin', turn always to nothin'
Next to your lady is special
Seen a bigger picture on the screen
But you're a movie, you move me, you soothe me like holidays
Getaways, the brochure said do it, so true
It's not a hold hand mission cut the public display
Heard you're headed for the stars, put the gazers away
Mine times out of ten, we cut to good friends
But when we on the tenth, we gotta go the length
I'm not a playa, yet I get more play
Than a talk show shown 'cross the USA
Have 'em moanin' out the vowels sounds, 'Ooh, eeii and aahh'
And how by now you should know me and my
Do members of the opposite sex
Have their boyfriend screaming out, we got more techs
Than that ball team in Georgia, yo, he said he's comin' for ya
All because the ho wanna go to the Casbah
I'll never give you up
No, I'll never stop
Keep it comin'
Keep on comin' 4 more
I'll never give you up
No, I'll never stop
Keep it comin'
Keep on comin' 4 more
You can get with some of these women, some of the time
When your face is in the light that's stirred with lime
Is it a crime to set your mind to death?
Resuscitated, see how many brain cells left
I feel your body's drawn to my positive
Don't even want a baby if it's that easy to give
I live right around the corner, three states away
Take a holiday, come check me, watch how I set the mood
Check a movie on the tube
Get your belt mad loose like lee
Phone's turned way down to avoid the beef
Or the questions if she's the only one gettin' lessons
You're into crime faces, huh? Well, I'll play your Capone
Suzy Q got the grill to make the cake chrome
Situation's gettin' absurd, hot on a plat
So work the format, see how we do that?
And you're figurin', we love on the rock
I'ma keep it up front to maintain the stock
Displayin' all the goodies from your knuckle to knees
Make it hot like the island degrees, now that's special
I'll never give you up
No, I'll never stop
Keep it comin'
Keep on comin' 4 more
I'll never give you up
No, I'll never stop
Keep it comin'
Keep on comin' 4 more
