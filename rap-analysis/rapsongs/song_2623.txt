And I'm in the house with Foxy Brown
For the nine-pound, plus one
And we got things goin' on, in a big way in here
You know what I'm sayin'?
So what we gon' do right now is want you to get involved
In what's about to happen, yo, drop that Foxy

They keep frontin' my firm'll keep sumpin', Fox, freak sumpin'
B-12 Coupes flossin', high-post, off me, killin' 'em softly', like Fugees
My lah be straight cheddar, in K sweater

Bubblin' mad chips, hard in the six, where we at, Brooklyn
And you know that, niggaz'll get dismissed so peep this

Layin' in the Telon, stone like Sharon, let's see, niggaz say he really

In fact, my sex games, all that
'Cause when I do my thing, no turnin' back
Bet that, I be stashin' in C-10
Chrome Lauren, shittin' hard in the Benz
Morocco bremen, niggaz scheamin'
Shoulda seen 'em, 850 y'all be men
Gettin' his wild on, frontin' at the bar, guzzlin' that low
Kiko, who he tryin' to style on? Courvosier sipper, all day
He was ballin', sway while the beat is 360 ways
Anyway, I continues to floss iceberg shit on the ass, of course
That's how we plays, high-post all day
Come 'round my way, see a true player play
Fox Boogie, straight ballin' all day
You know how I do nigga, the firm way, hey

Bitches a dime go loco for that flow doe
