What's up baby?
I ain't trying to do nothing but get me grown man on
I ain't trying to hurt you, only if you want me to
Yeah, something like dat
Yea, what's happenin' baby I'm Lil' Wayne from New Orleans
Fresh out tha navy now tha captain of my own team
Hop in this, machine, vanish from tha scene
Goddamn it I'm so manish, handle it like a standard
So put yo panties and yo pants my tha trash can
Romance on tha floor plans, yeah
We hold hands while we rollin'
Just tryin' to keep up wit tha program
Just trying to sneak up on ya, like how you doing ma'am
I'm a old soul, and a young man, we got to it and
We didn't stop 'til tha birds hit tha block
And she ain't never had it like that
Girl, you are so fine
I wish that I could get you over here, girl
Tonight so I can get my grown man on wit you
You don't know about it, how I'm a grown man
You don't know about it, how I'm a grown man
You don't know about it, how I'm a grown man
You don't know about it, how I'm a grown man
Now I don't really hit tha club but tonight I'll make an exception
For some reason I can't seem to keep my eyes out your direction
I'm lookin' at you so hard, I could probably catch a charge
Feelin' tha way you walk when you move yo booty applaud, damn
I gotta keep my composure
I gotta untact my mission and handle business like a soldier
Young man, young money but tha money long
Current sitta hot spitta so grown
And yo perception of me is so wrong
Don't worry 'bout what you heard 'bout me and them other birds
Might have done a lil' dirt and left a few of them hurt
But whatever has occurred they all got what they deserved
And you don't rock like that them I can see it in yo eyes
If you ain't good for me then you wearing a disguise
'Cause tonight you lookin' like miss right
And I'm suppose to be a player for life, but I'll change for ya
Girl, you are so fine
I wish that I could get you over here, girl
Tonight so I can get my grown man on wit you
You don't know about it, how I'm a grown man
You don't know about it, how I'm a grown man
You don't know about it, how I'm a grown man
You don't know about it, how I'm a grown man
You ain't no woman you a baby gurl, living in tha ladies world
And I'm a grown man, tha women understand
See what I go through is what I owe you
So you should throw that ass back to me right now, yeah
Fly boy baby sit back relax and
Cruise wit a nigga thats tha nations satisfaction
Whose is it baby she say, "Weezy fucking baby"
I say, "yes and fucking these", she say, "Don't you ever leave"
I say, I say "But I got money on my mind"
Then I tell her never mind and we do it one more time
For a large amount of time
Long and won't stop til daytime come home, yeah
Girl, you are so fine
I wish that I could get you over here, girl
Tonight so I can get my grown man on wit you
You don't know about it, how I'm a grown man
You don't know about it, how I'm a grown man
You don't know about it, how I'm a grown man
You don't know about it, how I'm a grown man
Damn, look, that, oh, that right there
That's tha sunset girl, get cha visor
Where those Chanell shades I get you
You always losing things, and I'm always buying new things
I come a long way huh remember, remember dat block
Look at you, you think you all grown
You ain't no woman you a baby gurl, living in tha ladies world
And I'm a grown man, tha women understand
See what I go through is what I owe you
And you should throw that ass back to me right now
