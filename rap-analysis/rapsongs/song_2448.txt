Shhh, I hear my people callin me,
"where is he?  where is he where is he? 
Where's the pmd? "
I'm layin low, strapped with ammo
Set for funk mode, ask your man though
Who raps rhymes hold it steady - like a pilot in the cockpit
Parrish smith go out - nah that's bullshit
On another nigga for tryin to take mines, catch the flatline
Comin through time to breathe on the mainline
Airtight, no time to stall, you tell me..
"yo nigga respect mine, or anger the tec-9
Chk-chk-pow, move from the gate now" -> raekwon

Some say the wu fly, what's a rap star? 
A nigga who get props and he's clocked like radar
Can't fake moves - people lookin at cha
Twenty-four oh seven - slip and they gat cha
Snatch that behind up - clip that ass with handcuffs
Jail cell for the niggaz who like to get rough
And most niggaz get rough, cause in beef we trust
Another man damn kid you smokin angel dust
I'm snatchin props, blastin niggaz like robocop
Catch the speed-knot, tryin to mic block mic doc
Chill hobbes - I told you I roll with the hit squad
Stomp like the gobots
But some niggaz ain't hearin me so I make it clearer see
You can't fade the nigga who flips words - like swayze
And audi 5000, still housin, I'm out an'..
"yo nigga respect mine, or anger the tec-9
Chk-chk-pow, move from the gate now" -> raekwon

So turn this mic off so I can kick the wicked shit
Type of wicked shit, that make niggaz grab clips
But hold it chill - cause a jail cell's bullshit
Must grab the head - no time to be slippin jack
The world done shifted - niggaz can't see that
But some do - and they make power moves
Playin for life - can't lose, too many dues paid
Mayday, in the game everyday tryin to find a better way
Yet the world keeps slippin
So I keep movin not tryin to lose an'
Big up to all posse plus crips and crews in
Every ghetto - keep your shit thorough
And if they ask have you seen ?  "hell no"
