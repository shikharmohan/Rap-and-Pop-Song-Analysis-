Yeah yeah
Fool you know how we do it
West Side
Comin' from the West Side
Nothin' but the West Side
Ain't nuttin' goin' on but the bomb ass rap song
Hittin' all night long
Just like me on the black and white ivory
Gettin' six on artillery, you don't want to see a G
Break yo' ass like dishes
Buster ass tricks, sleep with the fishes
Runnin' from Lennox, up at Venice
They wanna have me in stripes, like Dennis the Menace
But that ain't poppin', ain't no stoppin'
Fo' hoppin, ass droppin, Coupe De Ville
My truth can, ill fool I got skills
So, back on up 'fore I check that chin
Down as fuck and I'm full off Henn'
You gets no love and I thought you know it
Fool, you know how we do it
Comin' from the West Side
West Side, comin' from the West Side
Chillin' with the homies, smellin' the bud
Double parked and I'm talkin' to Dub
About who got a plan, who got a plot
Whom got, got, and who got shot
'Cause everybody knows that he got the info
Crazy toones hangin' out the window
Fool I got them bomb-ass tapes
Da Lench Mob, Planet of the Apes
I'm down with Eiht, and Watts up
Kam is solo, they got nuts
When Ice Cube write a sentence
I want 'The Bomb,' just like George Clinton
SKD is down to catch a body
Put on knee deep we'll turn out your party
You gets no love and I thought you know it
Fool, you know how we do it
You know how we do it
Jack B nimble, and Jack B Quick
If you wanna jack me on a lick, 'cause
I'm that fool from South Central
You think you stuck yourself, with a number 2 pencil
That's how I poke hot lead in yo' ass
With Mo' bounce to the ounce in the dash
Mash up, Ve-nice, headed for the West
Everything is great, slow down for the dip
On a hundred and eight and keep mashin'
Don't drink and drive to keep the fo' from crashin'
Stashin' a glock and I thought you know it
You know how we do it
Comin' from the West Side, West Side
Nuttin' but a West Side
It's hittin' on the West Side
Fool, you know how we do it
