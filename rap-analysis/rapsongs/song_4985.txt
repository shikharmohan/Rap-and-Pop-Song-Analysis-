You doin' ho activities with ho tendencies
Hoes are your friends, hoes are your enemies
With ho energy to do whacha do
Blew whacha blew, screw whacha screw
Y'all professional like D.J. Clue, pullin' on my coat tail
And why do you think you take a ho to a hotel?
Hotel everybody, even the mayor
Reach up in tha sky for tha hozone laya
Come on playa once a ho always
And hoes never close, they open like hallways
So here's a ho cake for you whole ho crew
And everybody wants some 'cuz hoes gotta eat too

Can't turn a ho into a housewife
Hoes don't act right
There's hoes on a mission, and hoes on a crackpipe
Hey ho, how ya doin', where ya been?
Prolly doin' ho stuff 'cuz there you ho again
It's a ho wide world, that we livin' in
Feline, feminine, fantastical, women
Not all, just some
You ho, who you are?
There's hoes in tha room, there's hoes in tha car
There's hoes on stage, there's hoes by tha bar
Hoes by near, an hoes by far
Ho!

That you suckin' down chocolate like daddy-o's
You hoes are horrible, horrendous
On taxes y'all writin off hoes as dependents

But hoes don't feel so sad and blue
'Cuz most of us niggaz is hoes too
