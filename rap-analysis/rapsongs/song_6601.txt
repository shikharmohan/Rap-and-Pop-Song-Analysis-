Promise I never leave you...
[Chorus]
Boy, boy, boy
You know that you got me Snoop 
You're a joy, joy, joy
It's all the pimpin things you do
You got me in a daze
And I dont know if it's the haze
'cause we smoke so much ooh ooh
(Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh)
Yeah the bitch gotta bitch
Hang out with the D-O-Double 
Girl be a part of this
Now hang up your coat
Blaze the dope
Never missing a stroke
Yeah Yea
Now this here's a ?
You ever seen a stretch ?? jet two seater (No)
It aint what you want it's what you need
A real ass nigga to help you kick your feet up (Yeah)
Now flip your channel to Lifetime
You stay on my mind
Even when I'm writing rhymes
We can chill all day until the nightime
I'll let you know when to go at the right time
I know you don't want to go
But you gotta get the hell up outta here (Go)
I say go, you say no, GO
[Chrorus]
Have a drink have a ?
What it do...Whatever you want
And we dont wait until the first of the month
We never hesitate to roll a hundred dolla blunt
Nigga, money is nothing to us
It's big pimpin over here baby you fucking wit us
Struck it rich with the struck of luck of the dutch
Tripled you up you alittle late for the flush
You got plans for a honymoon
I got plans to move your fine ass up in my living room
At the studio on the d-low
Is you wit it (Never leave you no)
You gots to stay committed 
To do what I say no matter how I spit it
You wit it 
If I say go, that means go
Now go
[Chorus]
Ooh Ooh
Yeah come spend a week wit the black jack tripper
Unzip your zipper
Gotta couple of bitches that's gonna help you up outta that
I want you to sing wit 'em
All y'all sing together
Come on we gon' be a group
Let me here you say
Promise I never leave you
All my bitches let me here you say
Promise I never leave you
C'mon let me here you say
Promise I never leave you
Promise I never leave you
