Oh you man, oh you man
Murder one of y'all niggaz
Oh you man, oh you man
Get to hurtin' one of y'all niggaz
Oh you man, oh you man
Bitches, snatch the shirt off one of y'all niggaz
Oh you man, oh you man
Kick dirt
Color glocks splitters, just listen there's UFO visitors
Fly paintings remainin', reclinin' pro-comissioner
One boot off, he Rudolph, know he hyped flew off
Hibernatin', dead in the makin', ear-rake him, gear-rake him
Technician murderer, wu hit the universe
Our words is crush, fingers icy slush, ringers wants Mercedes Benz
Tip bottles, movado, sailin' in some wu goggles you follow
Mail and jail letters, sendin' niggaz lottos
What made you murder my flow? What made you rival my clothes?
What made you? Fuck it, your son these niggaz gotta owe
I think a lot of flows, I flip exotic hoes
We paintin' pictures if it's just have seen a lot of those
Gettin' fly with ghost, power just buy the boats
RZA your vision is exquisite, Daddy hide your scrolls
Platonic chronic shows, tonic prose
Off the meter panasonic know, son line me a ho
Devestatin' shockwaves strikin' the nation
Newsflash, warn the people, assassination
The hour of detonation, pure untampered or mixed in any form
In any form mixed untampered, it's pure
Dissect each line of the rhyme
Find my ingredients and nutrients
Teach patience and obedience before movement
Killer bee student enrollment
I'm out your control and expose if it's synthetic
Quote these plush degrees as I inject, there's many at risk
Slang therapist Shallah Rae
Plus the people, with magnificent wordplay
Murder one of y'all niggaz
Oh you man, oh you man
Get to hurtin' one of y'all niggaz
Oh you man, oh you man
Bitches, snatch the shirt off one of y'all niggaz
Aiyyo, you know the half, some get respect, most we show the path
They quoted tracks while we spoke math, blowin' fast
Expose the craft, first picks chosen in the draft
I don't flash, hoes love me 'cause I hold a stash
Known to blast, paramedics couldn't close the gash
Floatin' past in an alley with the oak dash
Show the cash, watch it blow in half, it's no fair
They goin' mad, check their tape recorders and their notepads
Crabs wanna play me close and grab
Can't believe you on the canvas, I'm just throwin' jabs
Where the powers you supposed to have, hand in your soldier rag
You posin' bad, show your ass son, you won't last
With heavy weights that elevate the whole mass
Compose a smash, rollin' grass at ghost lab
Oh you man, oh you man
  (Drink to your new life, drink to your new life)
Oh you man, oh you man
  (Iron Flag, Iron Flag brothers)
Oh you man, oh you man
  (Br-br-brothers, Iron Fla-Fla-Flag brothers)
Oh you man, oh you man
