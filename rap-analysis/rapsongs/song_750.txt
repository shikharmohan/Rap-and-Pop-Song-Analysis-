This one goes out to all the black woman across
The whole planet earth, givin' our black nation birth
Nothin' in this universe is worth your worth
So we dedicate this song, black woman
This one is for every woman I was ever with
The ones that I cared about and ones I just wanted to hit
I feel ashamed for all the times
That I called you a bitch
And I, know I was wrong, can you ever forgive?
The negative, we used to use sex as a sedative
I abused your respect for me
I would choose to react disrespectfully
Never thinkin' the impact would come back to me
Now I'm the son and I know you're my reflection
Let me give you love and my protection
Proper education Allah's correction
Eternal lies, within your eyes
I hope you realize that I apologize, for all the lies
I never meant to make you cry all the mistakes that I
May have made and games that I played
Been put to an end, black women
Let me take this time, to let you know
You've been on my mind, and even though
I always haven't been kind
I wanna show you that you really divine, sincerely
Let me take this time, to let you know
You've been on my mind, and even though
I always haven't been kind
I wanna show you that you really divine, sincerely
Now she's the most beautifulest thing in creation
She give me motivation causin' constant elevation
Seein' more than booty used in lustful situations
So feel the vibrations, she's the mother of our nation
Now for oh, so long you stood by us so strong
Even when we done wrong, so I dedicate this song
More priceless than a worldly treasure
You bring love joy pleasure, countless things that are unmeasured
Some raise seeds all alone with no father in the home
But they still find the strength to continue on
I see you more than a crack head or a chicken head
Or just a piece of somethin' I'm tryin' to get up in my bed
You often say a lot of times we demean
Sometimes we do to lift the hard head ones up to queens
Our whole purpose is to give a proper surface
'Cause the black woman always is a queen
Let me take this time, to let you know
You've been on my mind, and even though
I always haven't been kind
I wanna show you that you really divine, sincerely
Let me take this time, to let you know
You've been on my mind, and even though
I always haven't been kind
I wanna show you that you really divine, sincerely
My fondest thoughts and memories go out witchu
And I'm sorry for that time that I hit you
The finest lights you radiate, you lookin' bright
And that's why I love you with the chocolate skin
Finer things were never made in this world
There you are lookin' like somethin' worth somethin'
Make me feel pride when you walk with me
Sit down and talk with me, for a minute
It's kinda hard for me not to stray
But I think I'm gonna start today
Hey I'm tryin', at least I ain't lyin'
(Like that frontin' ass, you know what I'm sayin'?)
Send a rose to your wife, she probably saved your life
Put up with cheatin' and she mighta got beaten
You can't build a foundation based on lies and deceit
I'm tryin' to be right, I want my cypher complete
Let me take this time, to let you know
You've been on my mind, and even though
I always haven't been kind
I wanna show you that you really divine, sincerely
Let me take this time, to let you know
You've been on my mind, and even though
I always haven't been kind
I wanna show you that you really divine, sincerely
