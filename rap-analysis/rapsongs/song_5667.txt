You are the one
You're the ooooone!
Other brothers just don't know
You got to feel me on this one man
So real
I'm so sin-serious about it, you know?
I know, I know more than a few is gonna relate
So much more than a few (fa-really real)
So much more (on the really real!)
When it started I knew it was trouble
But you know me
Them "hard an' e'rythings" can't hold me (you love, hardhead)
I need some shit straight out the movies
DRAMA
Warm to the touch, hot mama
You put me all in like launch jeans and scama
You was Mrs. Mine
So fine
Went from "we gonna conquer it all"
To "nigga I'ma see you in court"
I woulda never thought (damn)
I guess I better think again (you know?)
OK, now the shit is really sinking in
We ain't just divorced
We ain't even fucking friends
Cause in the end it was all about the ends
But fuck that I know it gotta be more to it
Held up with bitter hate with crosses all through it
And when I looked, what did I see?
You on the other end crying like me
Expression on your face like, "how could this be?"
That's what I'm asking, "what the fuck happened?"
How could all the magic and passion just vanish (c'mon)
Went from outsanding, to makin' me shout, "Dammit!"
Can't explain the changes, behavior's is outlandish
Now I'm just stuck in the road feeling stranded
I'm in the dark wishing for the answers
On some ol' "Biggie gimme one more chance" shit
When we met your face so brown
Ya ass so round, of course I'm so down
Wish I knew then what the fuck I know now
Couldn't read the signs in the road: "SLOW DOWN!"
I'm too deep in the road now
Got me pulling over getting smoked out
Fighting tears that I can't hold down
Can't believe it, this fucka's got me weeping
I keep it a secret so my friends won't peep it (live man?)
But late in the evening I'm up, my chest heaving
I'm reaching in the dark and I'm looking for the reason
(WHY!)
Did our love have to die?
You and I were so fucking fly
Can't get it off my mind
The things that made me smile now make me cry
You are the one
You're the one!
FUCK YOU!!
I wish we never met, I wish we never kissed
I wish we never touched (I swear to God)
I wish I didn't love you so much
I wish I could forget how feel, how you f--
(Damn) That's a lie
The shit that made me smile, now make me cry
You are the one
You're the one!
FUCK YOU!!
Sometime I wish we'd come back
Man, I wish we'd come back
(Memories!)--No lie
For real?
Fuck that
No, for real
It's a dangerous necessity, it's a world famous mystery
Love
That's it
Peace!
