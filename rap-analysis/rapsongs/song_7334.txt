[Verse 1: T.I.]
Say girl
Ay, been holding on to you all night
So all my body feel wrong but its all right
I know you probably thinking you don't even know me (I Know)
But girl the club in the close what it gon' be
I'm tryna tell you when your place hit the poppin'
808 get you droppin' [?]
So much temptation when her waist get the rockin'
And her eyes in a locket
Can't stop it girl i'm ready to die
I say i'm ready to die
[Chorus: Jazmine Sullivan]
So don't let go of me now
Cause i'm dying in your arms tonight
Tell all my people around
That i'll see them in the after life
Cause something this big can't get that bad
So I really don't think again
Never ever come down
Your love has got me feelin' like
Imma die in your arms tonight
(You could be dying in the hands of a better man)
(So is you ready to die)
Imma die in your arms tonight (Girl is you ready to die)
(You could be dying in the hands of a better man)
(Girl is you ready to die)
(Hey is you ready to die)
[Verse 2: T.I.]
Hey living is over ratted
I see heaven when you make it
In your eyes in your thighs girl
I swear to god
Ive been waitin' so i'm patient
Yeah, for you to take it off
Thoughts in my head are racing all day by chasing your waterfall
See time is of the essence
I got none to waste it all
Ain't that a lesson so childish games I don't play it all
My partner say i'm whip they be hatin' I know why
In your arms girl i'm ready to die
I say i'm ready to die
[Chorus: Jazmine Sullivan]
So don't let go of me now
Cause i'm dying in your arms tonight
Tell all my people around
That i'll see them in the after life
Cause something this big can't get that bad
So I really don't think again
Never ever come down
Your love has got me feelin' like
Imma die in your arms tonight
This might be the last night that they see me
So tell everyone that I love
Got this mess through my heart completely
So I won't (I won't)
Be coming back (Come back)
Cause i'm sprung
[Chorus: Jazmine Sullivan]
So don't let go of me now
Cause i'm dying in your arms tonight
Tell all my people around
That i'll see them in the after life
Cause something this big can't get that bad
So I really don't think again
Never ever come down
Your love has got me feelin' like
So don't let go of me now
Cause i'm dying in your arms tonight
Tell all my people around
That i'll see them in the after life
Cause something this big can't get that bad
So I really don't think again
Never ever come down
Your love has got me feelin' like
Imma die in your arms tonight
(You could be dying in the hands of a better man)
(So is you ready to die)
Imma die in your arms tonight (Girl is you ready to die)
(You could be dying in the hands of a better man)
(Girl is you ready to die)
Imma die in your arms tonight (Girl is you ready to die)
(You could be dying in the hands of a better man)
(Girl is you ready to die)
Imma die in your arms tonight (Girl is you ready to die)
(You could be dying in the hands of a better man)
(Girl is you ready to die)
(Hey is you ready to die)
