Believe me when I say
Before light there was dark
Where you going, where you going?
Where you going, where you going?
Where you going?
And if I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
Places that I've have been, things that I have seen
What you call a nightmare, are what I have is dreams
Bad as that may seem, I know is only going to get worse
Love, a slug, which one am I gonna get first?
My journey's been a rough one, I'm not sure when it began
But the way it's looking, I kind of know when it's gonna end
What say love
Hold me down, baby, it's gonna be a rough ride
Niggas give us plenty of room 'cause I guess enough died
Let me travel 'cause my intentions are to travel in peace
Don't fuck around, I lay you down, you hit the gravel and cease
I could be a beast or I could be a gentleman
But if you ain't my dog, you gonna be like, 'Oh, it's him again'
Niggas will never win, this whole rap game is mine
Hot as you ever been, I was that in eighty nine
Seek and you shall find, look within and you will know
Where you coming from and where you gotta go
Come on
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
I will spend mad time in one spot, plotting my next move
Trying to figure out what is it that X do what X do
Some questions go unanswered, that's what I'm afraid of
Sometimes I can't show but I know what I'm made of
They made love or should I say they made lust
Bound, there didn't have to be love there, but they made us
I got quite a few sisters, I was the only boy
But being with my dog was my only joy
Like a kid with a new toy, I forgot about the ground
Escaped the misery, didn't think about the crime
Lost all track of time, was in another world
Everybody knew Earl but there was another Earl
Like the side of the dark, riding the park but wouldn't want to
[Incomprehensible] when they jump me, became a good runner
One by one they all went under, so I had the last laugh
They all thought it all was a joke but I had the last laugh
Come on
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
I feel the ghost from within, coming back to haunt me
Stay love in my peoples even though they don't want me
When I was bad, I was forgotten, like I was dead and rotten
Should've been getting love but instead was plotting
Shit wasn't right and it was all blamed on me
Didn't know that I was special till this rap shit came to be
Gave me a way out, showed me it was better to teach
Than bust niggas with the fo-fo, leave them dead in the streets
Over beef that was worth less, than the cost
Of the slugs that I bought to kill 'em
And that's because I thought I ought to kill 'em
Little did I know, death wasn't right
Didn't always show every breath was a life
It was to be captured in suspended animation
To be felt by all, understood by every nation
What's the sense of hating, when I can show love
What's the sense of faking, when I can show blood
Now what's the moral to this story?
Come on
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
Yonkers is where we grew
Trials we got through
On top is where we staying
Till the end as long as we'll pray
[Incomprehensible] everyday
On Hot '97, ya hear
DMX all through the year
