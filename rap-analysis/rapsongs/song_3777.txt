I remember, when you looked into my eyes
You saw right through me
And I could not hide
I was exposed, just like a child
All of my heart, you hold in your hands
I'm yours to command
I'm yours to command
I, I feel so humbled
With you in my life
With you in my life
I remember, when I looked into your eyes
I saw a reflection of myself
And I could not lie, out of control
Too weak to deny
All of myself is naked before you
But what can I do?
There's nothing I can do
I feel so beautiful
With you in my life
With you in my life
I remember, I remember, I remember, I
With you in my life
With you in my life
