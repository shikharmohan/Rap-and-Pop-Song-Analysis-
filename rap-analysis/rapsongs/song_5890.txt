Honey, um, yes, um
Take me to the crib and get naughty, um
Honey, um, yes, um
Take me to the crib and get naughty, um
Are those bullets in ya bra or are your nipples glad to see me?
Been wishin' since I'm three now I'm finally seeing a genie
Open that kitty, pretty, let me write it in graffiti
Ya name sunshine, baby
Been known by the glow in your panties, sweetie
Your poonany is screaming, "Feed me" so please me, uh
Free me, don't tease me, touch your toes
And kiss your knees, ease up in it
Not minutes try sections of half 'n' hours
We'll be on every end of your house like it was ours
And you ain't gotta suggest respect sunshine, can't get less
I'll affect every part that your man neglects
I've been observing how your curving
Campaigning for a serving now see, I got that pretty kitty purring
Honey, um, yes, um
Take me to the crib and get naughty, um
Honey, um, yes, um
Take me to the crib and get naughty, um
One time with the sunshine
Sunshine, one time with the sun
One time with the sunshine
Sunshine, one time in the city
Are you in the easy cat or kitty category? What's the story?
You got two pairs of lips which shall I pick to make you wiggle for me?
Adore me, don't let that cat catch your tongue
One time with sunshine and that snatch could catch you strung
Don't wanna wish to hear you sing, wanna know I heard ya sung
Here's one free vote for C notes and loose tongues
I'm here, you knock 'em off but you start with your boots on
A party with the body, Lordy, where only two comes
And the truth is smoked boots is the proof
Once tight socks stretched loose and condoms on the roof
Hittin' steep and ain't complete till
The kitten sleeps between the sheets
Now our naughty emblem is written deep
Honey, um, yes, um
Take me to the crib and get naughty, um
Honey, um, yes, um
Take me to the crib and get naughty, um
One time with the sunshine
Sunshine, one time with the sun
One time with the sunshine
Lady, I crazy and underrated, can't be test of faded
Blowing up the spot like that ass just detonated
Spouting out sperm, not spaded out, with my worm I waited
The hotty hair was knotty, a perm and she mighta made it
Plus she had a shitty attitude so no alarm
On a scale o' one ta damn she was a yawn
Darn, with most it ain't no speaking after freaking a number one
More weekend in between meetings
But sunshine was pretty as Puerto Ricans
So that thought went down with the sunset
Now you wanna know how naughty can one get
Get strapped up like the Mad Hatter
Lips between hips like Mick Jagger's
Do some cabin stabbin' like a dagger
Just cool, let's wet up the pool and rub-a-dub
Trade your dud for a stud, bustin' more than suds in a tub
So I love it when ya let it get it
Get thirsty like a dry reservoir, never sore when I wet it
Say pathetic but I say sunshine is super
Put that poonany on the roof
And that shine might wake the roosters
So I'm through till I scoop her
One time with the sunshine
Here kitty, kitty, kitty
Damn, where's that cat?
