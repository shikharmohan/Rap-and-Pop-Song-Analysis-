Poppin', stoppin', hoppin' like a rabbit
When I take the Nina Ross, you know I gots to have it
I lay back in the cut retain myself
Think about the shit and I'm thinkin' wealth
How can I makes my grip?
And how should I make that nigga straight slip?
Set trip, gotta get him for his grip
As I dip around the corner, now, I'm on a
'Nother mission, wishin', upon a star
Snoop Doggy Dogg with the Caviar
In the back of the limo no demo, this is the real
Breakin' niggaz down like Evander Holyfield, chill
To the next episode
I make money and I really don't love hoes
Tell you the truth, I swoop in the coupe
I used to sell loot, I used to shoot hoop
But now I make hits, every single day
With that nigga, the diggy Dr. Dre
So, lay back in the cut, motherfucker 'fore you get shot
It's 1 8 7 on a motherfuckin' cop
Boy, it's gettin' hot, yes, indeed it is
Snoop Dogg is on the mic I'm 'bout as crazy as Biz
Markie, spark the, chronic bud real quick
And let me get into some fly gangsta shit
Yeah, I lay back, stay back in the cut
Niggaz try to play the D O G like a mutt
I got a little message, don't try to see Snoop
I'm fin to fuck a bitch, what's her name? It's Luke
You tried to see me, on the TV, you'se a B G
D O double G, yes, I'm a O G
You can't see my homey, Dr. Dre
So, what the fuck a nigga like you gotta say
Gotta take a trip to the M I A
And serve your ass with a motherfuckin' AK
You, can't see the D O double G 'cuz that be me
I'm servin' um, swervin' in the coupe
The Lexus, flexes, from long beach to Texas
Sexist, hoes, they wanna get with his
'Cuz Snoop Dogg is the shit, beeitch
Ah, I'm somewhat brain boggled
So, I look to the microphone and slowly start to wobble
Grab it, have it, stick it to the plug
It's Snoop Doggy, I got a got a fat dub
Sack of the chronic in my back pocket loc
Need myself a lighter, so, I can't take a smoke
I toke everyday, I loc everyday
With the P O U N D and and my nigga Dr. Dre
Lay back in the cut, like I told your ass
Gimme the microphone and let me hit you with a blast
I got a little cousin by the name of Daz
And bitches who fuck him, gimme the ass
'Cuz they know about the shit that we be goin' through
And they know about the shit that I be puttin' up
And they be knowin' 'bout the shit I do when I'm on the mic
'Cause Snoop Dogg is trump tight like a virgin, the surgeon
Is Dr. Drizzay, so lizzay and plizzay
With D O double gizzay the fly human being seein'
No, I'm not European, bein' all I can
When I put the motherfuckin' mic in my hand, and
You don't understand what I'm kickin'
'Cuz snoop is on the mic and I gets wicked, follow me
Listen to me 'cuz I do you like you wanna be done
Snoop Doggy Dogg on this three two one, umm
Dum, diddy-dum, here I come
With the gat and the guitar was strung, I'm
Not that lunatic nigga who you thought I was
When I caught you slippin', I'm gon catch you then I peel your cap
Snapped back, relax
You better not be slippin' with them deez on the '83 Cadillac
So, we gonna smoke a ounce to this
G's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this
