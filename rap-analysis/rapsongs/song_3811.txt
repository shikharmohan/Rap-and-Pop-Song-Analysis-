It's a new day
And all you gossipin' backstabbin' habitual haters
You're all history
So you can hate or hail the Queen
But it don't matter
'Cause you ain't got nuttin' for us
So as long as you live, remember this
You can't fuck with Queen Bee, Queen Bee, Queen Bee
All you haters will see, see, see
Oh don't be mad, I can't put this money in a casket
I can't put these cars in a box with the ashes
I can't take these diamonds with me when I die
I can't build that pretty white house in the sky
I know you wishin' that you wrote this song
But these same words comin' from you would be a joke
You better off takin' heed from your boy Jada
I know you hate dyin' but you gon' die a hater
I've got a vision, I think for the future baby pah
Y'all near sighted, lotta y'all, can't see that far
Rocks like the street light, baby watch 'em glow
Red yellow and green, don't know whether to stop or go
I'm a chameleon, I got many styles of rhymes
Like a bottle of fine wine, I just get better with time
From 'Hardcore' to 'Notorious' you studied my flow and still
You can't fuck with Queen Bee, Queen Bee, Queen Bee
All you haters will see, see, see
Oh whether ya, slingin' the rock or you got a wicked jump shot
Or just a fiend for this Queen Bitch of hip-hop
Kimmie bag dudes from the barbershop to the car show
The industry down to Wall Street
They ask "What is she like, what does she need?
What is her type? I wanna give it to her
Tell her please, be my girl, I'll give her anything
Whatever her heart desires in this whole world"
Just 'cause you ain't a millionaire don't mean you can't compete
You ain't gotta be filthy rich but you can't be cheap
I like a man that can stand on his own two feet
Gotta strong business mind, straight out the streets
He gotta have security, power and wealth
'Cause I can do bad by my goddamn self
And if you spiritual, got a good heart and can make me laugh
And can fuck
You can get with Queen Bee, Queen Bee, Queen Bee
Take you to ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy
Ain't nuttin' gon' change, my name, gon' get bigger
It's in the cards for Lil' Kim to get richer and richer
So like it or not, I am who I am
When I die hold my body in the Brooklyn Museum
Now take it to the bridge
Baye ya da, da, da da dah
Don't that feel good?
Full force sing the break one more time, c'mon, c'mon
Baye ya da, da, da da dah
Don't that sound so nice?
You can't fuck with Queen Bee, Queen Bee, Queen Bee
All you haters will see, see, ecstasy
You can get with Queen Bee, Queen Bee, Queen Bee
Take you to ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy
Gotta let 'em know
Let 'em know
Can't see the Queen, Queen Bee, Queen Bee
