Hey, when I think about all my time and all my struggle
Through all my grindin' and all my troubles
Man, I came up from nothin', all I had was a hustle
With a blindfold tryin' to find pieces to the puzzle, no muzzle
I tell it like it is, that's that, right or wrong
I'ma call it how I see it, don't forget that impossible is nothin'
Your environment is irrelevant
Just don't let your emotions over power your intelligence
Refuse to give up, your mistakes don't define you
They don't dictate where you headin', they remind you
That time keeps tickin', let your mind keep clickin'
Never stop thinkin', be aware of your decision
And beware of the collisions
And the potholes hidden in the road
That you travel on your lifelong mission
Just listen everyday like a snap shot is taken
If you live you could learn if you just be patient
'Cause life is like a slide show
And all the places I go
And all the things that I know
Through all the highs and lows
'Cause life is like a slide show
And all the things that I've seen
And all the things that I dream
You can't take away from me
'Cause life is like a slide show
'Cause when I look back at a fly young cat
Who could rap with a dream, look where I took that
Beginnin' on bank head, then I spread out
Vision in my head, all I had to do is to get it out
When I walked out of my house, and look at my street
All I see is the opportunity that lead me to truancy
I ain't really have a role model to influence me
Uncle [Incomprehensible] they said next it's gonna be you in it
As a juvenile caught cases so fluently
Look at my life and learn from it, don't do it
If I only knew back then what I know now
How much better life would have been if I'da slowed down
Maybe I'da been Kanye, instead of seein' gunplay
But God got a plan, I'll understand one day
But one day of life like a snap shot is taken
If you believe you can make it, have faith, be patient
'Cause life is like a slide show
And all the places I go
And all the things that I know
Through all the highs and lows
'Cause life is like a slide show
And all the things that I've seen
And all the things that I dream
You can't take away from me
'Cause life is like a slide show
Lookin' back on my life time
See the slides go by, tryin' to wonder why
Lookin' back at where I've been
I remember when, you remember
'Cause life is like a slide show
All the places I go
And all the things that I know
Through all the highs and lows
'Cause life is like a slide show
And all the things that I've seen
And all the things that I dream
You can't take away from me
'Cause life is like a slide show
'Cause life is like a slide show
'Cause life is like a slide show
I see, I dream, life is like a slide show
