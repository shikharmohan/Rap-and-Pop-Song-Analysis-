Reporting from kims kinda star
Holly, CO sem team kinda far
Ridin' through the city in a tonka toy
I got old money, coulda bought a dinosaur
Only ride Chevy, never drive a Ford
And my Coupe doors open like plaza doors
Yep, red thick women, eyes adore
I'm a hoe, you know that I'm a whore
Yep, cash money, cash money, monsta boys
Mafia bitch, even a cop's a boy
When you say you want beef then I got ya, boy
I'll just let the Big Mac whop ya, boy
See my dreads hanging like a, like a rasta boy
But with my rasta in I'll turn into mufasa boy
We run up in ya casa, boy and blast off like NASA boy

Cash money is army, nigga, better know its gravy
If you ever fuck with youngin', if you ever fuck with baby
Shit gon' be crazy, nigga doin' it like the 80's
Buncha young niggas poppin' off and they sprayin'
Up in the early we thankin' for the sunshine
Got to get my bling goin', reach for my chrome 9
Kiss momma 'cuz we goin' out and gettin' mines
Next nigga in line 17 on the grind
Shoe first, nigga not seein' mines
Big purses, million dollar headlines
5 drops, OG the last big time
Lord to the game, nigga till it's my time
Like father, like son, nigga this time
Junior got the fame and the game mastermind
200 on the dash, nigga, watch me mash
Doin' doughnuts in my hood, gettin' paper bags

Livin' is red, that's how we play it
A uptown senior be blood till I'm dead
That's what I said, I put some change in yah head
If you ever crossin' line, nigga nuttin', but bread
50 shots from high, nigga, we won't stop
From puttin' candy on the slabs, nigga stirrin' the pots
Put the hammer on the jam, nigga, pull it and pops him
Put the rubber on the bands, nigga stackin' his knots
Bitch, I'ma boss, bitch, I'ma boss
And bury me like my father on a cross
And carry 19, I shall over a cross
Shawty got that game on lock like a vault
Weezy baby, kyan pepper, no salt
Windows down on the hulk in the winter, it's your fault
I don't jump on the track, I pull forward
I got that S on my chest that I'm supposed to follow
I walk around like I got a S on my chest
I walk, I walk around like I got a S on my chest
I walk, I walk around like I got a S on my chest
That be that cash money piece cold restin' the dead
That be that cash money, c-c-cash money
That be that cash money, c-c-cash money
I walk around like I got a S on my chest
That be that cash money piece cold restin' the dead
