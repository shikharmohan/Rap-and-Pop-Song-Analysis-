Hola mama, hola papa
Como estas? Bien y tu?
Chillin', you look good, you too papi
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro
Yeah, [Incomprehensible] por favor
[Incomprehensible] right, yeah, yeah
Check, check [Incomprehensible]
Yo, check me, check me, yo
Such a long way to go
But I can't wait to see my little Spanish fly
Such a lonely road to roam
But I can't wait to see my little Spanish fly
Right, right, yo, yo
I met her at the Copa Cabana, how she look?
Word to mom, she bananas, I swear I wanna slam her
Like Tito Santana, can't wait to wrestle her
Curious about the sex in her, Gabbana dress on her
Next to her, this cat champagne sippin', ice drippin'
Roley's on the cuff but she winked at Big Stuff
How you doin', papa? I'm just chillin', mama
Loungin' smokin' on your Cubana
Si, D, first name Heavy
She started rubbin' on my big belly
Stay put, I can see how you got these other dames shook
'Cause from the first look a nigga like water was hooked
She said the name was Carmelita Boricua
From Puerto Rica, tu eres, mi amiga, senorita?
Me and you friends baby, me and you friends
Si somos amigos
Such a long way to go
But I can't wait to see my little Spanish fly
Such a lonely road to roam
But I can't wait to see my little Spanish fly
Yo, you the fliest lady in the house, true, hear Heavy out
Wanna make you scream, wanna make you shout okay
Let me feel this real, baby we can chill
Week in Brazil, D, keep it real
Sleep in the hills, native of the Ville
Native of Jamaica, steady makin' paper, aight
See all the linens be crushed plus the gators
Smoke Cuban, gruff smoke Garcia Vegas and dutches
Did world tours, ten buses, what? Live life deluxest
Some friends is hustlers and them the type
Of cats that will spend ends to touch ya
See me, I wanna love ya, just flow with Diggy
And I'm always thinkin' of ya, that's word to Biggie
Let's blow this joint and splurge the city
Damn you, pretty, gracias, and them niggaz over there
Can't stand you with me, mamita, um beso, por favor
Por que? Por favor mama, por favor
Such a long way to go
But I can't wait to see, my little Spanish fly
Such a lonely road to roam
But I can't wait to see, my little Spanish fly
Such a long way to go
But I can't wait to see, my little Spanish fly
Such a lonely road to roam
But I can't wait to see, my little Spanish fly
[Incomprehensible]
I see like that
