You and me should just let this go
We never did take the time, to try to hold on
I'm thinkin' that you and me, should just let this go
We never did take the time, to try to hold on
I'm sick of that
Yea it's hard, breakin' up ain't never easy, believe me
But fuck that, I wasn't gettin' treated like I needs be
But trust, I was controllin' all the things around me
But shit, I always been this chick ever since you found me
I tried and I tried, cried and I cried
Down for you nigga wit' lie after lie, after lie
Got sick of tradin' games wit' you
Started bein' jealous of me like dames would do
I'm like dawg, check ya balls, mad 'cause I receive applause
Men in my life was against the law
Startin' fights in public just so you could piss me off
I swear, if I was a dude it'd be fist to jaw
Always mad at my mouth 'cause I cursed you out
Missin' hard, know you feelin' what these verses 'bout
Doin' dumb shit, breakin' things, hidin' my phone
I'm outta 'dis here, pimp jus' leave me alone
You and me should just let this go
We never did take the time, to try to hold on
I'm thinkin' that you and me, should just let this go
We never did take the time, to try to hold on
I'm sick of that
Ya love girls, girls, yea but you lost the best
I had to get away, I'm past the stress
Mama told me baby girl never settle for less
Learn the hard way, hard days, I'm ready for next
A bunch of leavin', I don't need Eve's shit, I'm doin' me
Soon as pack you sippin', with the booze, you and me
Reminiscin' 'bout the way you was pursuin' me
Actin' like your period on screamin' you doin' me
Well, bye dawg, have a nice life, I'm fine dawg
Don't try to track me down or call 'cause that line off
Hope you feelin' bad without me, see if you can laugh without me
Cry what tears? I'm happy, I'm free
Still ridin' past the spots that you know I go
Procrastinatin' wit' yo niggas hopin' that I show
Never know what you have 'till it's gone
Wonder what she doin'? Best believe she doin' her
You and me should just let this go
We never did take the time, to try to hold on
I'm thinkin' that you and me, should just let this go
We never did take the time, to try to hold on
I'm sick of that
Funny, how it happens when you fall in love
When you find out that the one you wit ain't who you want
Then you move out 'til you find yourself anotha love
But your ex gone always hate 'cause he can't hit you off
You don't hear me though
Claim you wanna please me, yet you vex me
Can't front, be thinkin' 'bout the way you used to sex me
God damn, days short, nights was long
And I was mad when I started spendin' nights alone
But I'm better off by myself lookin' for somethin' else
Sendin' me shit you can't pronounce, I don't want nothin' else
Wanted to love you until the end of my time
But fuck it, I'm done wit' you at the end of this line
You and me should just let this go
We never did take the time, to try to hold on
I'm thinkin' that you and me, should just let this go
We never did take the time, to try to hold on
I'm sick of that
I'm sick of that
I'm sick of that
