What is freedom but a fleeting notion,
is this reality or just emotion,
I would rather be a giver then,
be apart of hurting you again,
I want to be conformed to love, show me what to do again,
show me to win your love,
I want to be conformed to love,
so I can perform love,
My impatience is the part of me,
that I realize you hate you say,
it complicates the very art of you,
show me what ought to do,
I want to be comformed to love,
so I can perform love,
My Beloved is the greatest Love, YES!!,
I think of him all the time,
My beloved is the greatest love,
please make up my mind,
I want to be conformed to love,
so I can make more love,
I want to be pure pure love, 
so I can restore love,
so I can make more love,
so I can be sure love,
Help me be secure love,
so I can make more love,
so I can restore love
*Talking* That is the objective, to be conformed to love, to actually be love incarnate,
because that is what I was before, but ya'll got that I think,
to be love incarnate, and to not listen to people who might say there's something wrong with being love, you know. I'll give you an example:
You talked about professionalism,
but what does professionalism have to do with a real exchange,
you are as professional as you have to be right now,
you are as professional as you need to be,
your sincerity has offended me in any way,
it hasn't confused or complicated things,
if anything it's broken down and made the environment more comfortable for everyone else,
What did it do, what was the cost of your lack of professionalsim, your so called lack of professionalism, because I don't call it that.
I believe a world can exist on honesty, I just do, you know. I'm a believer
