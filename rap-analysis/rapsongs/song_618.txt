Ain't nothin' changed everyday, ain't nothin' changed
It's an everyday thang when you hear the bucks bang
Mo Thugs is all you claim
Stay thug up in this game and remain the same
So follow me, now see off to the double-glock and hear pistols poppin'
(Now see)
Buckin' them bodies with shots
And a come on, a come on, a come on
Everybody get up, get down
Everybody get up and like my fucked-up gang without the green
Gotta have another bill, y'all, dog, I need all my change
Soon as come up, I'm pullin' my people up outta the bullshit
That's why we choose this thugsta music
Use it smoothly, don't abuse it, do it, oh so, lovely
Gotta get, gotta get, get money
(Mo' money)
Thuggin' forever we keepin' it real and I'm ready to show
And then let niggas know with Mo Thug that the shit, it be real
But them murder, we told ya, rollin', blowin' indo, we go
Niggas that real, we are trues, yeah, ready to bust on anything
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up, nobody move, won't nobody get hurt
Break it down, killa, me killa, killa
I'm wonderin' really how many more niggas I'll see in a coffin
Before it's my time, I'm the kind right here to take losses, not a dime
Everyday it's the same and I gotta mine to the grind
My mental be stressed on my pistol
My only utensil for cheddar, it's on the level war
Whatever my mind is my church and my kids or my pleasure
Would ya like to come parlay with Lay all through my hood?
Sit back, everything gon' be all good
Niggas ridin' real, knock on wood, goin' against the grain
It's all the same, it's all the same
Smokin' on a lot more weed than before, no pain, no gain
You straight up hangin' and that's shame, how long we'll reign
Bang, bang, gotta get down for my thang
Ain't nothin' to do to get outta this game
(Outta this game)
Run the game with consistency, instantly
And guard them greens of the earth with resistance
Baby, baby, tell me what do you wanna do?
Tell me, what do you wanna do?
You can ride and smoke with me or I can ride and smoke with you
It's all cool, it's all cool, it's all cool
Act a fool, act a fool, it's all cool, it's all cool
Really wanna get me pissed
Then get to flippin', when I'm on a mission
Me and Animal'll gnarl, wanna go shut you down and eat breakfast
Oh so, don't you know that I know you're whole M.O.
And away you go, and I got
([Unverified])
Smoked little bit, you know so, hit it, me stumble and even scuffle
([Unverified])
And I heard my little brother smacked the shit out you bitch
And bust you, hear my nationwide, "Fuck you, fuck you"
I got people that you trust, who needs some greens
And really don't love you
Never familiar, send 'em all in the city out to kill ya
It's an everyday thang and I bang your brains, nigga
Ain't nothin' changed everyday, ain't nothin' changed
It's an everyday thang, it's an everyday thang
It's an everyday thang, thang
It's an everyday thang, it's an everday thang
It's an everyday buck, buck, buck, bang
Calm me down, it ain't gon' change, we won't change
Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, we keeps it realer
Tell me, can you feel us, feel us, feel us?
Tell me can you feel us, feel us, feel us, killas?
Even though we still roll the Clair, playa haters better beware
'Cuz we got mines, we got nines, we got shit to blow you all the time Anytime you got yours, you got yours, I got mine, I got mine
Fuck with mine, fuck with mine, East 99 is the street
Keep it on the low when they creep, or Bone got heat, Bone got heat
Hurt them who tried to hurt me, B 0 N E
'Cuz I'm rollin' with ya, 'cuz I'm rollin' with ya, 'cuz I'm rollin' with ya
It's an everyday, it's an everyday, it's an everyday thang, bang
It's an everyday, it's an everyday
It's an everyday buck, buck, buck, bang
Ain't nothin' changed everyday, ain't nothin' changed
