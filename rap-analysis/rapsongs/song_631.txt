Armed and dangerous, ain't too many can bang with us
Straight up ***, no *** ***, label us Notorious
Thug *** *** that love to bust, it's strange to us
Y'all *** be scramblin', gamblin'
Up in restaurants with mandolins and violins
We just sittin' here tryin' to win, tryin' not to sin
High off *** and lots of gin
So much smoke need oxygen, steadily countin' Benjamins
*** you should too, if you knew
What this game'll do to you
Been in this *** since ninety-two
Look at all the bull*** I been through
So-called beef with you know who
F*** a few female stars or two
And a blue light, ***, move like Mike, ***
Not to be f***** with
Mother*** better duck quick
'Cause me and my dogs love to buck ***
*** the luck ***, strictly aim
No aspirations to quit the game
Spit yo' game, talk yo' ***
Grab yo' ***, call yo' click
Squeeze yo' clip, hit the right one
Pass that ***, I got to light one
All them *** I got ta fight one
All them ***, I got ta like one
Our situation is a tight one
Whatcha gonna do, fight or run?
Seems to me that you'll take B
Bone and Big, *** die slowly
I'ma tell you like a *** told me
Cash rule everything around me
***, lyrically, *** can't see me
*** it, buy the ***, cook the ***, cut it
Know the *** 'fore you caught yourself lovin' it
*** with a Benz *** it
Doesn't it seem odd to you
Big come through with mobs and crews
Good fellas down to the Mo Thugs dudes
Who's the killa, me or you?
We forgive you
For you know not what you do
Seven A.M., woke in the mornin'
With Hen and caffeine and green and nicotine
No dough so pop a couple of doze
'Lil Ripsta, *** Mista Clean
*** Dean, deep in my temple and not to get
Sentimentally sting, wit my
Instrumelody and heated
Especially for your team
And a forty-five indeed will beam
In between the scenes destroy your dreams
You willin' to die, we'll see
How many flees when I cause the scene
We mean mug, Mo Thugs
Trained to be perfect, disciples
When it's survival tongue, never double-edged sword
Triple, six rivals spittin' fire
This the real truth, ***, breakin' out for lies
My Messiahs better be ready for Armageddon ***'s expired
It's wild, bless the child, the one that became a man
Put in positions off in the Claire, all that I had to do was stare
Test me now, contender, never no surrender, no pretend
Pick up my pen, in my hand, one of my trusted friend, friend, hey
Open it let's see if we're real, we all suited
Beg my pardon to Martin, baby, we ain't marchin', we shootin'
In daily recruitin' there's a tough law
Everyday in the ghetto
We start 'em off little, we give 'em a bottle
And a pen and a pad to hit the label kick it
*** roll wit Bone up into the Thug spot
To the dome wit a shot of bird
Never get tossed to the curb
Be feelin' that urge to splurge
But I'm broke as ***, son, gimme that Mossberg swerve
Up into my bag 'cause I gotta get my mask and shells
To put in this twelve gauge sawed off
Get 'em all off, *** yo' loss, take it all off
Got a *** car door
But the Bone not Leatherface, too many are thinkin' they Thugs
They need the most help to pull it in doves
And *** if you stickin', we buckin' them guzzlers, *** up
Now let me get done with the grime
Gotta go purchase a dime
Put in a state to get done with the crime
Smokin' the *** to ease my mind
Swig some wine, step on the block with the rocks
But Willie be servin' 'em clemency
Gotta buck him on down if he come back talkin'
Like gimme back me money
Thuggin' with me killers, need us a leader
Or liquor but *** ain't got ***
Wit a sawed off pump, chrome thirty-eight ***
Now who ready to get bent
*** like me feenin' for them green leaves
But I ain't had no dough
Gotta make some money so
I'm makin' my dummy rocks if I go broke

Yeah, Little Lay, hey, comin' in the form of scripture
Finna get ya and hit ya wit magic
Droppin' down licks, betta call on my gadgets
With an automatics status we spray time to load the glocks
But I'm thinkin' not
There's another, he forced tellin' me do what I gotta do
So my otha potnah *** die tonight
And I'm always runnin' from the boys in blue
Biggie booms on my *** now provide the cellular phone
The carphone, what's happenin'
Grab artillery ***, start packin'
'Cause a mother*** try to get me in a jacket and I did him
Hit him right between the eyes, despise the wise
Wanna test a *** size, that'll cost him
*** *** around wit the wrong ***
Y'all get mo murdered all day, all day
We done paved the way and I'm on the run
I'ma call my boys and bring all the guns
Y'all *** wanna have a little fun wit number one
One, one, then it red, red rum, rum, rum, rum, rum, rum
But it red, red rum, rum, rum, rum, rum, rum, but it red, red rum
