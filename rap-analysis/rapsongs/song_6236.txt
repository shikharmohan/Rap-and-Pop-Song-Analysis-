Smokin'
(Okay)
Here we go smokin'
(Okay)
Yo, yo, jungle habitat, peep the wildlife in the open
Off the hook, nigga dial twice if it's broken
Doc, wall to wall with a mic and I'm loc'n, shit
You might find termites in the chokin' [unverified], yes
D.O., my wood grain say, "Fuck P.O."
(Okay)
And I'll prove it when I red line a buck three, oh
Hoes wit' it but never gave a fuck before
I'm frontin' a hundred on top, and ones below
Bitches fuck you star hoes, my hoes run out
Department stores with alarms and bar codes on
Think you catchin' me and my bitch? You dead wrong
I'm over here prepared, blowin' a air horn
You niggaz talk widdit
I do it blind blindfolded without walkin' with sticks
As dark as it gets, you slept in the Bricks
Now you lose like every year, you betin' the Knicks
We walk, dogs with more balls than pool rooms
(Okay)
Attitude wolf, I react to full moons
(Aoo)

You stuck up like them white boys on Harley's be
Are you ready to get, high with Doc

All my niggaz out in Jersey keep smokin' the Hershey
Keepin' your money thirsty
(Yeah, yeah)
Yo, yo dawg, I'm an MC, I don't think how you rap stars will think
I rush you, like you made the last call for drinks
My pipes burst and I ain't installed the sink
A radiator, I keep it in the car to mink
Chk, chk, yo trail the Bricks where I wrestle grizzly bears
(Okay)
And stick a track for it's snare and kick
When it's committed, damned if you see 'em again
Cold hearted, leaves fall off the tree on my Timbs
Help me, I keep the flow cold like Uris [unverified]
The words practically Geronimo off the disk
When Flex bomb it look, everybody runnin'
You bitches goin' wild, even Kitey wanna tongue 'em
I'm like the Gooch, lookin' for Arnold Drummond
Walkin' with a trench coat to part the pumpin'
Like MJ, I wanna be startin' somethin'
Whoever ain't widdit, gotta move widdit
One fo' fo' hydro smoke to choke on
(Okay)
Bran son holdin' handguns to toke on
Uptown with Big L watchin' over
He tell me there's NARC's parked on the shoulder
(Look over there)
I don't care 'cause I'm drunk as hell
Shit I do eighty on a speed bump to bail
Doc Deebo, keep both cannons on reload
Weed keep my fingertips yellow like Cheeto's
Are you ready to get, high with Doc
(Okay)
If you high nigga then lick a shot
(That's right)
To my niggaz in Atlanta that, carry the hammer
Wrap 'em with bandannas

Yo, to my bitches, my niggaz jump up
It's Elmer Fudd with the shotty pump, who want duck?
Ride in my hoop tie, back, slumped up
Five niggaz with me, strap, pumped up
Dump Forrest Gump, hand on the pump
Janitor, gettin' drunk off a janitor drum
Way I spit, on my tongue, I branded the gun
Tarzan, I rap loud, animals come
I'm on top of a giraffe neck
Throwin' spears, I'm Def Squad in both ears
Y'all niggaz ready for streets? Here it is
Circle status, with no pyramids
Are you ready to get, high with Doc
(Okay)
If you high nigga then lick a shot
(That's right)
To my niggaz in the West that walk without a vest
