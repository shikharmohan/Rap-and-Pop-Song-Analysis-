I get out
I get out of all your boxes
I get out
You can't hold me in these chains
I'll get out
Father, free me from this bondage
Knowin' my condition is the reason I must change
Your stinkin' resolution is no type of solution
Preventin' me from freedom, maintainin' your pollution
I won't support your lie no more, I won't even try no more
If I have to die, oh Lord, that's how I choose to live
I won't be compromised no more, I can't be victimised no more
I just don't sympathize no more
'Cuz now I understand, you just wanna use me
You say love, then abuse me
You never thought you'd loose me
But how quickly we forget that nothin' is for certain
You thought I'd stay here hurtin'
Your guilt trip's just not workin'
Repressin' me to death 'cuz now I'm choosin' life, yo
I take the sacrifice, yo, if everything must go, then go
That's how I choose to live
That's how I choose to live
No more compromises, I see past your diguises
Blindin' through mind control, stealin' my eternal soul
Appealin' through material to keep me as your slave
But I get out
Oh, I get out of all your boxes
I get out
Oh, you can't hold me in these chains
I'll get out
Oh, I want out of social bondage
Knowin' my condition
Oh, is the reason I must change
See, what you see is what you get
Oh, and you ain't seen nothin' yet
Oh, I don't care if you're upset
I could care less if you're upset
See, it don't change the truth and your hurt feeling's no excuse
To keep me in this box, psychological locks
Repressin' true expression, cementin' this repression
Promotin' mass deception, so that no one can be healed
I don't respect your system
I won't protect your system
When you talk, I don't listen
Oh, let my Father's will be done
And just get out
Oh, just get out of all these bondage
Just get out
Oh, you can't hold me in these chains
Just get out
All these traditions killin' freedom
Knowin' my condition
Is the reason I must change
I just accepted what you said, keepin' me among the dead
The only way to know is to walk, then learn and grow
But faith is not your speed
Oh, you've had everyone believe
That you're the sole authority
Just follow the majority
Afraid to face reality
The system is a joke
Oh, you'd be smart to save your soul
Oh, and escape this mind control
You spent your life in sacrifice
To a system for the dead
Oh, are you sure?
Where is the passion in this living?
Are you sure, it's God you servin'?
Obligated to a system, getting less than you're deserving
Who made up these schools, I say?
Who made up these rules, I say?
Animal conditioning
Oh, just to keep us as a slave
Oh, just get out
Of this social purgatory
Just get out
All these traditions are alive
Just get out
Superstition killing freedom
Knowin' my condition
Is the reason I must die
Just get out
Just get out
Just get out
Let's get out
Let's get out
Knowin' my condition
Is the reason I must die
Just get out
