Taking a bath within the sun rays
Letting the Aura of life soak me
Living in the country chickens, cows, all around me
I'me bored I'll take a drive into the city limits
Yo life is just a secret recipe and I'm all up in it
Being the grand papa that I am one can forget it
Today I figure I deserve to swerve
From my normal nerdy status that engulfs my time and that is
Just what I need so here it goes I suppose that it's on
Shake out my dreads with aloe, Vera it's rare a
Brother like me will agree with Taree, Kwesi, and go party with Baba
But yo I gotta be hip and dip within the fountain of youth
The fountain of youth
The fountain of youth
The fountain of youth
The fountain of youth
Once I learned to dip and got drenched I got drenched
Without the fear of drowning my ears can hear the sound and
My eyes are wide open, O P E N
And consciously aware of my surroundings
Wally I'm getting energy, golly gee
As if I'm solar powered
It seems like every now and then
I skim on the edge of nuttiness
Letting the wind push and shove in my dreads as if it's an argument
But really they're just snuggling for affection, hair needs loving too
Speaking of love the western civilization is on another tip
To tell you the truth, they need to dip into the fountain of youth
The fountain of youth
The fountain of youth
The fountain
The fountain of youth
The fountain of youth
Fountain of youth
Fountain
Bopping my head is more that bopping it's a spiritual thing
Rhythms and lines space and time
Relative? Yes I pump my sound loud so my people can hear it
I hope the music soothes our spirits
'Cuz it soothes me
My foundation is strong
But I allow some things to move me
And that is energy from the fountain of youth
