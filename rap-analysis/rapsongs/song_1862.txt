"Right / Wrong"
THIS...IS...MY...LIFE
[Chorus]
(Right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong).
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong).
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong).
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong).
[Verse 1]
Made me a leader before I was ready to lead.
Took away my hunger, but didn't give me greed.
Made me successful, when I just wanted to be heard.
Give me the light, cause all I need is the word.
Give me a life that I'm responsible for.
I'll give him what's right, cause I'm responsible for him.
And into the night, I'm gonna be there with him.
Facing a fight, I be right there with him.
Ready for Heaven, cause I done been through the Hell.
And since I was seven, I've had a story to tell.
See God is great, and that's why I'm still livin'.
He gave to me, so I'ma keep on givin'.
The bravery of a man's mind is slavery.
Is makin me the man I was made to be.
I hate to see when cats know but don't spit it.
Right is wrong, when it's on you gon get it.
[Chorus]
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong).
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong).
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong).
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong).
[Verse 2]
I wake up frustrated dog, I'm hurtin' inside.
Think about the brothers that put in, work and then died.
A certain have tried, a certain have cried.
When it didn't go right, you hit me like.
You see things ain't always what they seem to be.
And the reason I dream of thee is He's with me.
And the reason I get through things so easily.
Is by the grace of God cause he, see's the need to guide me.
Walk right beside me.
Because he knows what's goin on inside me, he tried me.
Knew where my heart was at.
Knew what I was thinkin.
Knew when I was down and out, left there mistaken.
Knew when to pick me up, cause it got too hard.
Knew when I was gonna scream out "Please God!".
And you already knew that you would be there for me.
That's why I bring you together to give you the glory.
[Chorus]
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong).
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong).
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong).
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong).
[Verse 3]
Everyday of life is a new chapter.
And it's already been foretold, so it's up to the soul to capture.
The essence of it all, the meek shall inherit the earth.
Destined to ride with the call from birth.
The true worth of a man, is not measured by what he does for himself,
but what he does for someone else.
And if you help another, without concern for a reward or gold.
What you give, you shall receive tenfold.
And I, put that on my soul.
And, put that on my life.
And, everything I own.
And, everything I know.
And, everything I show is what I was meant to do.
Everything I told you is what I've been through.
And everwhere I been, I was for a reason.
Walk through the desert, ended up freezin.
Start there, end up where?
And now they know...whatever which way they go.
[Chorus]
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong).
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong).
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong).
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong).
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong).
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong).
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong).
Whatever which way they go.
They know they gonna owe.
They soul to the road they choose.
It don't matter if you win or lose.
You still gotta pay them dues.
You still gotta pay them dues.
You still gotta pay them dues.
