Throw me them big old balls and watch how i play with them
We got my boyfriend Bow Wow in the house
My sweetie pie Lil' Zane, my girl Lil' Wayne, Sammie baby sing to me
[Chorus 1: (Sammie)]
Strike one, grab your balls by surprise 
Strike two, right before your eyes
Pitch three, nut,bust on my face and on the walls 
Ain't no fun like a game of Hardball
[Verse 1: Lil' Bow Wow]
When I step to the plate the outfielders get back (back)
'cause they know I'm the over the wall type of dog
So many back to back hits they call me little Sammie Sosa
Bubble gum, balled up all the hustlers
Y'all know how to work it when it's time to compete
On the field, on the court, over any hot beat
And break, and you know it when you see your clone
And right now that's all I see goin on, holla at me
Game time, all I think about is bringing home the trophy
If your team is better mine, you really gotta show me
Really gotta beat me, really gotta trash talk
Mistreat me, and send my squad back home
'cause I don't know loose to much
Matter fact, I ain't never lost at all
When I'm playin Hardball (that's right)
So, if you on the mound about to pitch to me
Understand I'm like Griffin, I keep 'em to the wall
[Chorus 2: (Sammie)]
Strike one, got you by surprise
Strike two, right before your eyes
Strike three, ohh I got you out
Without a doubt, I got you out
Strike one, got you by surprise
Strike two, right before your eyes
Pitch three, this ones to the wall
Ain't no fun like a game of Hardball
[Verse 2: Lil' Zane]
This goes out to them jocks that stay on my jock, throwin the nuts
Keep pithcin 'em, I'm in the kitchen makin radio rock
It's usually preferred, I be choosey with all my words
Throwin eggs at them chicken heads, bangin on the curb
I left 'em a word, I'm fast ballen with a curb
Happy slidin home, tellin them friends that's in the third
Sure ya done heard, who I'm doing and what I'm doin was false
And what's true, girl listen
When it comes to this game they call me Zane McGregor
That other kid was just a mark, so I made him retire
See, we all got a base, and we hold our own
But when I come up to bat, we all goin come home
And our fans cheers us, 'cause they know what the drill goin
Out of the field and into your automobile
And I hope it ain't your Range Rover, that you spent your change over
I'm on the dick with my tounge i'll play the game over
[Chorus 2: (Sammie)]
[Verse 3: Lil' Wayne]
Listen, listen, listen
They call me young Wheezy, Rodriguez
You know I'm gettin you hot, hot as the Kendrick, ya know
And I keep the crown bat swingin, swingin that at iron
Pitch on the block like Nolan Ryan
To crazy for TV, you won't see me I'm ridin the streets
I'm a hustler, people, my life in the streets
Watch the game, get you life in the streets
My watch, my chain, and my teeth Cost
That way I will never cheap talk
And I call my mommy sweat heart, she call me sweet daddy
And she gladly, loves the way that daddy bat it, yeah baby
Whezzy Wee is a playa baby, and I don't share babies
So if you searchin for some bitch ain't nothin here, baby
Catch me throwin an eighty in the latest Bentley
Goin out, and Whezzy never hit a foul, a Hot Guy
Dont hit pop flies are knockin up, out the park
And after the games over we gone meet up after dark
[Chorus 2: repeat 2x (Sammie)]
All my sweetie pies Lil' Bow Wow, Lil' Zane, Lil' Wayne, Lil' Sammie
The Little Rascals, and me y'all know my name JD=JENNA"DESTINY
