[Chorus]
[Verse 3:]

You don? t know about da courtrooms or another hearin?
Snitches ain't snitchin? it be like dey be fearin?
Thru da lyrics you can hear it I spit it how I live it
Get to da money by da bundle how I spend it
All my cars tinted but dey kno who? s in it

If your da one famous why dey let you through the doh
[Chorus]
