DPG is down with us
X to the Z is down with us
DRE is down with us
My nigga Kokane is down with us
Eastside gang is down with us
Niggas talkin' shit I'm gettin' ready to bust
I'm number one, one, one
With a bullet motherfuckers
I got this Henn in my cup and this buddah got me stuck
I'm just trying to compose myself, compose myself
I don't know why I act this way, I just wanna be left alone
I'm just trying to enjoy myself, enjoy myself
Aww naw, who is it?
It's motherfuckin' Snoop Dogg
I live the fast life where ya keep ya cash tight
In broad daylight walkin' wit ya flashlight
Addin' up what ya brought in from last night
She mad tight with mad bite is that right?
Bad lil' bitches on my tizeam, tizeam
Nigga that's the American drizeam, what?
Pussy  broke the president, yeah it did
And pussy  made a pimp rich, yeah it did
I live like 'em both as I smoke on my dope
On my boat thumbin' through C notes
Now here's a toast to the coast
'Cuz we doin' it the most, we doin' it the most
Playa playa high costs
Uno dos I'm 'bout to get ghost
Stackin' what ya mackin' D O double G
The shit you doin' is so lovely
The haters hate 'cuz they will never be
There ain't no limit to this melody melody
You niggas sippin' on that jealousy jealousy
I pour a tall glass of Hennessy, want some?
Do you wanna have a sip with me?
Or would you rather try and trip with me, trip with me?
Put ya cups on the table and your hands in the air
And touch your brim to the side that's only if you a player
And all the ladies in this motherfucker acting up
Don't hurt nobody when you back it up
'Cuz we came here to have a good time
Me and my niggas in the sunshine, sunshine
On 3 wheels with one 9, you know
It's time to shine the world is mine, the world is mine
I never ever dropped a dime, shit
Nigga might cop a dime
Never hesitate to pop a 9
And I always come up with the proper line
Stick to the script bitch, I'm hurtin' shit hurtin' shit
Let me show you motherfuckers what I'm workin' with
Don't need no water to go with your order
And you ain't got to smuggle the shit up over the border
Affordable sportable unbelievable
Feasible and reasonable we leavin' 'em low
'Cuz me and my loc keep big leaves of smoke
Gallons of Hennessy and 16 liters of coke
He done drank and she done smoked
The meters are broke we put the V to the note
I brought the weed to smoke
And Dr Dre he hooked the beat up indeed it was dope
Stackin' what ya mackin' D O double G
The shit you doin' is so lovely
The haters hate 'cuz they will never be
There ain't no limit to this melody melody
You niggas sippin' on that jealousy jealousy
I pour a tall glass of Hennessy, want some?
Do you wanna have a sip with me?
Or would you rather try and trip with me, trip with me?
Put ya cups on the table and your hands in the air
And touch your brim to the side that's only if you a player
And all the ladies in this motherfucker acting up
Don't hurt nobody when you back it up
'Cuz we came here to have a good time
Me and my niggas in the sunshine, sunshine
On 3 wheels with one 9, you know
Yeah
I got this Henn in my cup and this buddah got me stuck
I'm just trying to compose myself, compose myself
I don't know why I act this way, I just wanna be left alone
I'm just trying to enjoy myself, enjoy myself
Shaquille O'Neal is down with us
Look half dead is down with us
My nigga Mel man is down with us
And Eastside watts is down with us
The whole crip car is down with us
My niggas on the four yard I'm givin' it up
We number one, one, one
With a bullet motherfuckers
