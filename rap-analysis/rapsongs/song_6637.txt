Snoopy, it's what they say as if they knew me
Groupie on my head like a koofie
My nigga kid Cudi, that's my little buddy
Calls some hoes up and get some cudi cudi
What's your life like, mines is kinda tight
A long way from hustling, that shining light
My people love the fans love me come all go
If you ain't showin' love then what you call for
I don't need it in my life, my kids pay the price
Sorta like the need of my wife
Smoke 'til I'm gone, dog on the throne
I'm worldwide known, I'm a boss in the zone
I get it how I get it 'cause I can, I earn my spot
You see the plan, I'm just fuckin' with my fans
I turned out to be the better man, important to life
You understand while I'm puffin on this gram
Everythin' I'm havin'
No, they ain't necessity
Though I'm shinin', keep on grindin'
What you see ain't all of me
Though I keep them hoes, don't love them hoes
The code in which I roll
It's so simple what I need
You know I keep my fame and I can't forget that tree
Na, na, na, na, na, na
I can't forget that tree
Na, na, na, na, na, na
I can't forget that tree
Na, na, na, na, na, na
I can't forget that tree
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
I got my fame dog, look at my niggas
Got a 'lil money, yo and I ain't trippin'
Most days are faded, feelin' the next way is
Steady wanting freaky hoes then I want a lady
Holdin' the fame down and my close homies
The people who was there were some suckas, let me lonely, phoney
When you see a nigga don't approach me
Made it to the top, baby haters on me
Catch trying to claim that they made me
However you feelin' the real fo' gazy
I keep it 100 never frontin', no need be
I made it in a zone no place you could see
Well, nigga, come yo to haters that don't know
Loco how a nigga life from post po
The ones fans love who was always approachable yo
And I rep the double O, eating cheerios
Everythin' I'm havin'
No, they ain't necessity
Though I'm shinin', keep on grindin'
What you see ain't all of me
Though I keep them hoes don't love them hoes
The code in which I roll
It's so simple what I need
You know I keep my fame and I can't forget that tree
Na, na, na, na, na, na
I can't forget that tree
Na, na, na, na, na, na
I can't forget that tree
Na, na, na, na, na, na
I can't forget that tree
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Can't forget it, they made me who I am, a king
And I'm still on the scene, you gotta love it
All out in public, the people wanna touch me
I need a blunt with the stuffing
Nigga, it's nothing for me to chill out, post up at the house
With madden on the screen and smash on the homies
Hollywood, nice now everybody owe me
And the block talk shit like they know me
Oh, fool, take you niggas to school
How to get rich and stay cool
Snoopy D-O dub, show your homie
Even with the critics and the feds all on me
I was tapping all the conies
Dogg but my folks call me snoopy, boss dog nigga sue me
Ponytail swinging as I lay it in the kufi
Loving my life, while I'm puffing on the oh wee 'cause
Everythin' I'm havin'
No, they ain't necessity
Though I'm shinin', keep on grindin'
What you see ain't all of me
Though I keep them hoes don't love them hoes
The code in which I roll
It's so simple what I need
You know I keep my fame and I can't forget that tree
Na, na, na, na, na, na
I can't forget that tree
Na, na, na, na, na, na
I can't forget that tree
Na, na, na, na, na, na
I can't forget that tree
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Snoop Dogg in the house tonight
Blowing that blaker purp that I know you like right
Kid Cudi, my nephew blaze that shit
Right now would you, would you right?
Snoop Dogg in the house tonight
Blazing that Lakers herb that I know you like right
Kid Cudi, my nephew blaze that shit
Right now my nigga like fly
