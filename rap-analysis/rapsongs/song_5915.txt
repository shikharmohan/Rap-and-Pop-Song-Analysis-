One two, one two
I'd like to (what) introduce myself
You know who it is - it's Skillz
We, are, hip, hop
Uhh, uhh, let's go, c'mon
[Skillz]
Yo, they say I'm too cocky when I'm rappin
I say that I say what I say just so I can see they reaction
And my response when they askin - shut the fuck up nigga!
I wrote your record, I'm the reason you braggin
Y'all dudes not thugs, you 8 deep in the Coupe
That's not gangsta, that's a movin group hug
I can not be seen - I got a team
that'll spit bars and leave SARS on your pap screen
If it's the best then I'm above it
To spit game sick trick, it's no wonder y'all love it
You ain't even seen the best of it (nope)
Don't play wit'cha life nigga cause I'll add a -less at the end of it
Sell lives and y'all lie to sell
Without lies, your whole album would be borin as hell
I don't fail, dimes I bag and bail
And I done ran through more checks than Frank Avedale
[Chorus: Pete Rock]
Yo, this goes out to DJ's and MC's
Unlock real hip-hop, Rock holds the key
Magnificent, Skillz on the mic sound tight
Gotta, hit the stage then release the rage
New York to VA we crash the gate
Pete Rock and Mad Skillz collaborate
[Skillz]
Uhh, yo, yo
Cats, say I ain't mad, but I'm master menace
And y'all dudes will not eat until we get finished
And when that happens it's too late (uhh) cause after that
I'ma snatch your meal and then break the plate
I'm sick of hearin how y'all spit it
Hit send after you say your verse nigga, cause I don't get it
Outflowin these pros is gettin old
I'd swear I was in a marathon with some five-year-olds
What's bad for y'all, is that we won't stop
With that VA swingin that Mount Vernon knock
And when it hit the block it's called instant heat
Aiyyo Pete we done stumbled on a masterpiece!
It's called "One MC, and One DJ"
It's a match made in heaven like Snoop and Dre
And we, here to stay so y'all better get it right
We the future like LeBron, y'all the past like Mike
[Chorus]
[Skillz]
Uhh, yo, yo
Now who you know that wanna fuck with Skillz?
You better rethink your answer nigga and get real
If you think you can outstick me then your boy I'll bet
Cause I ain't met a motherfucker who can do that yet
Who came out - and put VA on the map (you)
Who still make jaws hit the floor when he rap
Y'all better switch occupations..
I'm the last nigga to spit acapella and get a standing ovation
On the real, who gon' stop me?
Plus I'm on MTV now, so I done got real cocky
On some rock star shit, go it alone
Pick a rollin stone and I ain't even holdin the chrome
Leave the soldier alone, huh - don't get mad at your chick
if you see my pic when you unfoldin her phone
On the real, y'all know how Skillz get down
He say what he feel and he don't give a fuck who's around
[Chorus]
