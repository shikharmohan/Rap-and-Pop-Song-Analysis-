Revelations, don't stop keep on
Sunshine, 'Ecstatic', flaco boogieman
Standing in the sun, getting black as I want
You playing good, man, that ain't backing me up
Sky woke a baby, ain't no jackin' my hem
I got a whole lot to say so I ain't talking to them
I hear knees dropping, I turn it up louder
Black freedom, black genius, black power
Black ink for printing the black dollar
Until I see C I A, I say now what?
And C C is central bank
Loose change, body slamming big money tanks
We tell God thanks, ya'll tellin' us God don't rank
That's why your breath stank, yuck
Lay off the bacon and smokes
Quit laying off the good working folks, quit the hoax
And lay off the corny color jokes
Con chilly populate the colors they won't
Ya big dope, yuck
Keep them out your face, keep 'em in your prayers
Either that keep 'em in the cross hairs
Better still keep a even dose of each
'Cause until you get justice you won't get
Peace, peace, peace,  peace,  peace, peace
The gun shot say, ba, ba, da, day, ba, da, da
Day, ba, da, da, da, da, da, day, ay
They shout peace, peace, peace
They shout peace, peace, peace
The firefight lit, ba, ba, da, day, ba, da, da
Day, ba, da, da, da, da, da, day, ay
Rumors and rumors and rumors of war
Can I get better, now what is that for?
And more rumors and rumors and rumors of war
Killers just killing now, what they kill for
And more rumors and rumors and rumors of war
Can I get better, now what is that for?
And more rumors and rumors and rumors of war
Revelations, don't stop, keep on
