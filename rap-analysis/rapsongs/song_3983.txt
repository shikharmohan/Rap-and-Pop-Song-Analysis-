Yeah, fuck that, yo, I want some pussy tonight
I think I wanna fuck my bitch, Goldie an' shit
Only because she got some money for me an' shit
I think about fuckin' her
An' go fuck my other bitch that live in fuckin' big houses
I don't know what the fuck I'm gonna do but check it
How you spell cash? C's an' some hash
At last, a nigga kickin' game full blast
How you want it, diamonds or dime-elles
Jansport bookbags an' bags from Chanel?
It's Seebeeaki smellin' up my Kawasaki
Jawns by Versace, all them joints by Jockey
Clock me workin' real hard for a nickel
He drive a tricycle an' his pants too little
An' his shoes too little
Won't you get with the clique with the big ass dicks
That make sure your kicks fit?
The real shit, true balla pack steel shit
The nigga with the movie an' the mill' shit
Mass appeal get me in the clubs for free
So all you got to do for me is just
Make your way to my king sized bed
An' lie on my pillows an' my Gucci bedspreads
Keep your pussy, I got other plans instead
Just gimme some head, gimme some head
If you ain't suckin' no dick
We don't need it, we don't need it
If you ain't lickin' no clits
We don't want it, we don't want it
If you ain't drinkin' no nut
We don't need it, we don't need it
If you ain't lickin' no butts
We don't want it, we don't want it
Some bitches do an' some bitches don't
Ride a dick 'til he bust, shit, I know I won't
Niggas cum too fast for me
A waste of a good dick, if you ask me
I like a nigga like to put his back in it
If it's a weave, fuck around an' pull a track in it
All I get few strokes, that's it
This bomb ass shit got your cigarettes lit
Who me? Forced to use plan B
Masturbate, play with the pussy
This nigga here bust off snorin'
He straight, I knew this date would be borin'
I wanna wake him up to do his duty
Nigga, use that tongue
Click the booty, click the booty
You wanna steal the pussy like a thief
Now kiss the lips without the teeth
So I could bust a nut or two, come clean like Jeru
Goodnight to you too, boo
If you ain't suckin' no dick
We don't want it, we don't want it
If you ain't lickin' no clits
We don't need it, we don't need it
If you ain't drinkin' no nut
We don't want it, we don't want it
If you ain't lickin' no butts
We don't need it, we don't need it
Nine out of ten women, want to spin
On the snake of Blake Carrington
But I need much more to get raw
Hard core, dick to jaw, dick to jaw
You drinkin' babies
Don't wanna hear baby strictly, yes, boo
Well, if he cum up on your chest slow
If not, then your not down with me
Little Ceasar, Van Clef or B.I.G.
Capone, Nino or Bugsy
Don't ask Kim for a date, she want her pussy ate
If you ain't suckin' no dick
We don't want it, we don't want it
If you ain't lickin' no clits
We don't need it, we don't need it
If you ain't drinkin' no nut
We don't want it, we don't want it
If you ain't lickin' no butts
We don't need it, we don't need it
We don't want it, we don't want it
Gimme some head
Gimme some head
Gimme some head
