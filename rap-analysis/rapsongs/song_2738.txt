Big mike how you livin'
I've been sellin' out the same dope house since the age of sixteen
Shufflin' crack like cards, to these burnt out dope fiends
Sellin' rock after motherfuckin' rock
Seein' cop after motherfuckin' cop on the block
Changin' face after motherfuckin' face
Watchin' niggas catch dope case after dope case
Add it up and you'll find more niggas doing time in the pen
'Cause he wouldn't snitch on his fuckin' friends
And that same motherfucker that didn't go to jail
Wouldn't come and pay his homeboys bail
But that's the way niggas do you
Caught a case for another nigga and he swear he never knew ya
Twelve months in the county you done got out and found out
That your homey runs his own dope house
And he ain't gave you shit
Not even a funky ass ounce to get on yo feet that sheisty bitch
And he still calls you family
But I be damned if I'll be kin, to a nigga who ain't payin' me
'Cause I ain't with that hoe shit
So if you thinkin' 'bout fuckin' me, nigga you better try some more shit
'Cause I done paid my dues and like a fool in the process
Watchin' other niggas progress
On the motherfuckin' shit I did
But in the 90s', it's payback and I ain't takin' no shorts kid
'Cause life is a bitch and I ain't that nigga to be broke
While makin' another motherfucker rich
So wise up nigga, get with the program
'Cause in this dirty game, you got to wash your own hands
And I got a tech nine ready to take mine and what's for me hoe
Yeah, no nuts no glory
Now I done heard a nigga say they callin' me the biggest bitch in Texas
'Cause I'm bummin' a ride, when I should be drivin' Lexus
But you know, I gives a fuck about what niggas say
I handle mine, by handlin' shit my own way
I let niggas thinks it's cool
To fuck a nigga like me, but they don't know that they psychin' fools
See I stay lokey
Lettin' a nigga think he know me, but he really don't know me G
Claiming that we friends when my little girl is ridin' the bus
And his little girl is riding a fuckin' Benz
Whose your friend? Ask yourself that shit
The only friend I got, is my fuckin' pistol grip
Filthy rich I know you love it I done made your ass fat
And you still talkin' 'bout twenty-five of a hundred
Be real that shit went out in 86
I'm down with the Geto Boys but my mind ain't playin' tricks bitch
You still refuse to give me mine cool
Nigga be that way and I'm gonna handle my business fool
Just like my nigga Snoop Dogg told me
You gotta be down for your shit, why you can homie
'Cause you's about to get your ass lit up
Because the fuckin' ain't proper
And I ain't the nigga that's catchin' the nut
Payback is a motherfucker, payback is a bitch
But payback is a must when I ain't the nigga that's gettin' rich
'Cause life ain't but one big chance
And unlike these other motherfuckers
I ain't scared to touch yo bitch ass
'Cause if you believe in fuckin' niggas, you's a hoe
And the pita man can't tolerate hoes so you got to go
Mr. Big Man, Mr. Big Nuts got everybody thinkin' you the shit
But really I'm the motherfuckin' one
So I'm about to grab my shit off the self
And go on a mission, one nigga gettin' busy by his damnself
So keep on thinkin' you fuckin' me
But while you thinkin', I'll be pullin' yo fuckin' number G
'Cause I'm a nigga with no heart and no woes
Gettin' down for mine's bitch, no nuts no glory
