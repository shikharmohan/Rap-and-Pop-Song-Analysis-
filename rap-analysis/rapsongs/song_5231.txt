Come on, come on, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
  (Come on ride in my rodeo, come on ride in my rodeo)
This one of another one of them nasty M.E.F. joints
Come on, come on, come on
  (Come on ride in my rodeo, come on ride in my rodeo)
To all the chicks with their asses thick
Out the whole click, she the baddest bitch
Dose-doh, 'round your partner, switch
Clan in da front, we be starting shit
No, don't trip, dog, spark 'em, quick
Holla when a real nigga talkin' trick
We got grip but we ain't spendin' shit
You and your friends, stop pretendin' trip
Let a nigga get nut pushed, better yet let a nigga get some head
I work 'em, work 'em or feed 'em, burp 'em then jerk 'em, instead
I get my nuts pushed from the bottom to the top of your gums
I feel your slurpin', slurpin', I'm skeetin' and squirtin' your tongue
And I got about five grand but I won't be spendin' a dime
See 'cuz overspendin's a crime and I can't be spendin' my time
If you get your guts pushed, could because of Luda and Meth
Could because we do it the best, could because we screw 'em to death
Come up out of them dirty clothes
Bend on over and touch them toes
Uh oh, we oh, we oh
Come on and ride this rodeo
Meth and Luda, we lock and load
'Round your partner, now dose-doh
Uh oh, we oh, we oh
Come on and ride this rodeo
I wonder where about five bottles of gin, models that wanna swallow
And wobble, gobble again, tell a couple of friends
I slap that ass, bitch, take a look and see what you got in
'Cuz I've been schemin' and plottin' to have you breathin' and stoppin'
What we talkin' 'bout? Pussy poppin', car hoppin' women
See 'em watchin', clockin' pigeons, flockin' Luda
They jockin'. lightin' buddha and boots is rockin'
Nameless hoes, take 'em brainless with painted toes
Famous she code, twerkin' pussy, hurtin', workin' that pose
They wanna raise that pussy tab, price and position
Enticin' these women, given the proper juice
Life that they livin', hope that they double deuce
Shifted ass cheeks last week in Ludacris's backseat
Afraid so, ask son, taste them
Now watch me, dog 'em, freak 'em
Out every weekend, she puttin' A.P.B's on my dick
I keep on bettin' and breathin'
Where's my pants, I'm leavin'
I'm speakin' facts, mammies creepin' and they cheatin'
They even sleepin' with mats, some be eatin' that cat
I'm teasin', indecent expose, Method be tweakin'
Keep pussies leakin' through pantyhose, marijuana smell on my clothes
This evening, these bunnies got me on swoll
I bust and reload
Honey, break out the 'dro and give me some mo'
[Incomprehensible] rodeo
Come up out of them dirty clothes
Bend on over and touch them toes
Uh oh, we oh, we oh
Come on and ride this rodeo
Meth and Luda, we lock and load
'Round your partner, now dose-doh
Uh oh, we oh, we oh
Come on and ride this rodeo
