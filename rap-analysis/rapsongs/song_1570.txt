Know what I'm sayin 
Life is like a game of basketball 
They just want niggas to run jump and shoot 
chorus: 
The game of life is a struggle to survive 
We live to win cause if we lose than we die 
verse 1: 
What's the word for the day homeboy 
It ain't nothin but this killin shit 
Tryin to get this money right quick 
You know how it is 
Nigga tryin to eat food and live smoke weed 
Payin rent on my crib so I can breathe 
Life is not about the quickest speed 
What you achieve 
Come to greed by the grief 
And what you get is what you see 
In your mind visually 
And manifest physically 
If you stick to it shit'll work out terrificly 
Take me, everyday my life be hectic and stressful 
Never really know if im'a ever be successful 
But the best things you get out of life require struggle 
If it don't you gettin hustled homeboy 
You gettin hustled 
How I see it 
Anything you wanna be you can be it 
If your mind can preceive it 
And your heart really believe it 
Than you half way there and all you got to do is do it 
And if you give it all you got there ain't really 
Nothin' to it 
Chorus 
Score, this ain't no game this is war 
Score, this ain't no game this is war 
Score, this ain't no game this is war 
Score, this ain't no game this is war 
(talking in background) 
Get your fucking heads in the game, please! 
This season don't mean nothin if we lose this! 
word up 
Verse 2: 
As a, black boy 
Started out a bundle of joy 
but quickly I grew playin with toys 
Than you started makin noise as a youth 
Tryin to figure out the truth 
Behind the shit that the schools ain't tellin 
First come rebellin, then come drug sellin 
Juvenile court, 'cause you too young to be a felon 
Knew that everything around you was yours 
But you gotta maintain the game of wealth that the 
World has in store 
A wise man told you before 
You got the power to bring things to life black boy 
You can test it 
Everything you see is just a thought manifested 
But before you had a chance to know that 
You got arrested 
And it all seems clear to you know, you can breathe 
It was different 
When you couldn't see the forest from the trees 
If you follow your dreams you can accomplish anything 
If you always do your best then your destiny is king 
Of the world 
Chorus 
People don't let life, no no 
Don't let life mislead you 
You have the power 
People don't let life 
Don't let life deceive you 
You have the power 
Yeah, score this ain't no game this is war 
Score, this ain't no game this is war 
Score, this ain't no game this is war 
Score, this ain't no game this is war 
Verse 3: 
Life is like twistin' a blunt, it's how you roll with it 
Just figure out what you want and go and get it 
anybody tryin' to stop you 
For tryin to do for you 
That's your enemy dun 
The sun be right up in your crew 
That's true 
Life is a thinking mans game 
Use your head for it 
Ain't no use in bein scared a shit 
If you prepared for it 
Go for what you know good 
This whole wide world is your hood 
Plus the universe 
Cause you was on the planet first 
Score, this ain't no game this is war X4 
Chorus 
People don't let life, no no 
Don't let life mislead you 
You have the power 
People don't let life 
Don't let life deceive you 
You have the power 
Just use your power 
Don't be a fool 
Don't ever lose your cool 
You got the power
