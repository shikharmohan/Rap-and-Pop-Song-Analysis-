This is a U A rhyme, dedicate to the canine
Tc ha, ch, tc hk, C'mere boy, I said it's playtime
It's time to play with the mind of a slimming
I don't wanna be a freak but it's the dog in me
I don't pretend to be the open door roses type
I open the door for myself and I close it right in your face
Now you wanna taste my food, what?
You got your own food, get a attitude
You get left, call the ref if you think it's foul
I ain't tryin' to hear that, so have a Coke and a smile
'Cause after awhile, I'ma wanna get buck wild
And now months later, I'ma say it ain't my child
I'm sterile girl, we ain't never did nothin'
'Cause only you and I know that the Common Sense is bluffin'
Little Miss Muffett, that's how the ball bounces
Sorry you gotta bounce the ball eight pounds and two ounces
That's how I'm livin', just like a Rottweiler
When I was a shorty, I was a lot wilder
But then I got milder, and settled down with a harem
And when I can't bear 'em, I share 'em
You see it's like no, pass it off, pass pass the puss
I ain't a nerd but we've got Bush
So cut the bush brat and let's move it like a U-Haul
Forget the grindin' shit, I ain't tryin' to get the blue ball
Brap bump me child, I'm speakin' upon the nitty gritty
I'm a dog here kitty, kitty
Zippidy, doo, dah, a zippidy, zippidy day
Unzip your zipper baby and come my way
I'm Jack the Ripper, na, nah not Jack Tripper
'Cause three is not company when your other two friends are thicker
So come one friend, come two friend, come all
United we stand, divide your legs so I can fall in your bowl of cherries
Kerrie is so very thick thicker than the Dick, Tom and Harry
Tom and Jerry what? A Woody Woodpecker
You need body work, I work that body, I'm a body wrecker
Inter sector, I'm the nectar plus the plum
I manage to take advantage, 'cause some of these hoes are so dumb
If you got some, just an unseen BIT of game
Then it's safe to say it's that bet you can get a dame
I shoot, aim the same game, yo obedient ally
Tell 'em that I get the drawers come off immediately
Here comes a nut slut and we can do the Beat Street strut
And be that I'm a mutt so what?
No but if's or maybe baby, look who's talkin' to
It's true when I'm drunk I might bone anything that's walkin'
Down the street, watchin' ladies
Nobody's watchin' you, because you got a baby
I ain't tryin' to be a stepfather so I don't bother
Word to mommy dearest, I look farther
Down the road, to a road not taken
I'm tired of all these same bitches, I need to take care
A new flower, so Joe can take a shower
And get wet, and then jet like ah, 7, 47
I tell the girls my number 7-7-7, 93, 11
Then I'm steppin', so when they call me, you'll hear
"Is Common there?", uh-uh, sorry
You got the wrong number, if you wonder I'm the lumberjack
Choppin' down the cherry tree and never comin' back
It's like that and it'll be like that
Because a dog is a woman's best friend black
