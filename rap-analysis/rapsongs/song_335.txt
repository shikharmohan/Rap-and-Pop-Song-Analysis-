This one goes to my man old dirty, one love, we be swiggin' brew
Trigger too, even Nas, I be diggin' too
Let's see whose left Mobb Deep, oh yeah Meth
That brother's hot like curry, one love to Keith Murray
Rappers like Craig Mack quench my thirst for comedy
I'd love to hang with Red Man but I ain't messin' with that bam bazee
The Brat, Lil' Kim, Foxy get that loochee
Especially that cutie representin' for the Fugees, go girls
Even the NBA make rap dollars
Shaquille, Chris Webber, Cedric Ceballos
Talent's around the world, Phoenix to Providence
No need to educate Chicago, they already got Common Sense
Houston and Atlanta, we love you
Peace to the West Coast, they really set the Doggs loose
We always say the future's in today's children
If so, make sure Shyheim and A + sell a million
Peace to Eazy E, Stretch and Mercury
Tupac and Buffy, Notorious B.I.G.
We gots to strive to make hip hop survive
Brothers need to unify to keep the game alive
Rappers be comin' out with one album, then they gone
So with cats like Raekwon, support 'em so they stay on
Then brothers like Smooth wouldn't have to hustle
It's an every day struggle, but hip hop I still love you
We Entaprizin', got the hip hop heads realizin'

The fame in the rap game, we all want it
In fact by now I hope the Luniz got a hundred on it
And if you're in it for the millions, E-40
I hope you see 40, before you be 40
What it look like, the great paper chase for ends
Lost Boyz bein' found in Lex Coupes, Beamers and Benz
East Coast, West Coast unite, let's keep it tight
And everythin's gonna be alright
But hold up, it seems we got some hip hop cheats
Dependin' on just havin' catchy hooks and beats
Rappers usin' their skills, recently I haven't heard of none
Me, I represent myself better than Collin Ferguson
And yes, that I do, I'll shatter you
It don't even matter who, I'll make them all show gratitude
Fools actin' like they don't know the rules
Need to learn to listen when grown folks is droppin' jewels
Now they say, is Mr. Kane comin' back to dominate
I used to listen to his music back in 1988
Damn, he still pumpin', just when you think he ain't nothin'
That kid just keep comin' back
What, is he the Terminator or somethin?
Lord, I skill it in a way to make you feel it
Finally I reveal it, party people they can't wait until
Starts to boom out, so every rap consumer
Can bring that old schooler back just like alumni
I sting it, boo yah, to stop the half steppers
Tryin' to wing it through ya
Don't make me have to bring it to ya
Who gonna be the next clown to come step into my bounds
Right now get down for the crown
Mess around? Get pound to the ground by the sound
And let the more experienced entertain
Kane, meet the microphone, microphone, meet Kane
The legendaire, rap extraordinaire
Commutin' to your ear, yeah, looka  here
