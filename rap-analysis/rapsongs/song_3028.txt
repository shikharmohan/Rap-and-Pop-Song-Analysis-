(Let it rain)
I don't wanna go outside
(Let it rain)
I just wanna be with you
(Let it rain)
I don't feel like takin' a ride
(Let it rain)
You know what I wanna do
(Let it rain)
Girl, you makin' me sweat
(Let it rain)
Come close, let's see how far we can get
(Let it rain)
And I'll ease your pain
(Let it rain)
So let it rain, let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, honey, pop the umbrella
The heavster goes down smooth [Incomprehensible]
Fingers keep twiddlin' but I'll keep drizzlin'
Play like a fiddle and here to move a million plus
'Cause when I'm damp, I don't rust
Girls make a fuzz for the lover they lust
Nature takin' it's course so precise
Provin' Heavy D can strike more than twice
Pronto, snuggle, better yet cuddle
Happy like a little kid playin' in a puddle
Of H2O a drip drop [Incomprehensible]
So figure I'm somewhere makin' a rainbow shine
With an intend to broaden, the quiet storm
That lurks more often so lay with the lover
Snuggle up under the cover and I'll ease your pain
So let it rain, let it rain
(Let it rain)
I don't wanna go outside
(Let it rain)
I just wanna be with you
(Let it rain)
I don't feel like takin' a ride
(Let it rain)
You know what I wanna do
Now, we can go down stairs, strike a match to the log
Let the fire place burn, dim the lights till it's dawn
Don't worry, honey, I'll take good care of ya
I know what I'm doing, I get wrecked on a regular
Red light, green light, one, two, three
Hey yo, who's on the mic? Well, it's me, Heavy D
And I become somewhat of a national figure
You see, some are big but the heavster is bigger
And I like candy bars with nuts
And ippy dippy girls with prodigious butts
So, lay with the lover, snuggle up under the cover
And I'll ease your pain so let it rain, let it rain
(Let it rain)
I don't wanna go outside
(Let it rain)
I just wanna be with you
(Let it rain)
I don't feel like takin' a ride
(Let it rain)
You know what I wanna do
(Let it rain)
Girl, you makin' me sweat
(Let it rain)
Come close, let's see how far we can get
(Let it rain)
And I'll ease your pain
(Let it rain)
So let it rain, let it rain, let it rain
Okey dokey, lookin' for a trophy
Gigolo, Romeo, wrong category
More the dawn one type
Smooth like a preacher
Your high school teacher
Just call me your Daddy O, loungin' on the padio
Actin' like a kid but drive a jeep not a caddy though
Pardon me, Miss, in your high heel steps
Come inside the crib set before you get wet
Now, just for prop, let's keep this official
Heavy is the name, D is the initial
I love the way you strut in that suit from France
There's a party tonight, would you like to dance?
You're rollin' with the Lover
So be sure, you dress clever
I pick you up at eight
And my drops off whatever
All of a sudden, I got the tingle for a Twinkie
Fever, flavor for a pringle, I think I like to mingle
With somebody thick, someone that I can cling to
A milk chocolate beauty, someone that I can sing to
You got the makings of a rainy day, girl, to me
So come a little closer, let's see  how it would be
(Let it rain)
I don't wanna go outside
(Let it rain)
I just wanna be with you
(Let it rain)
I don't feel like takin' a ride
(Let it rain)
You know what I wanna do
Lightning and thunder kinda makes you wonder
Not too bad for a brotha who's the son
Of a father who's a tech and a mother who's a nurse
And I get paid 'cause I learned to kick a verse
I'm on a roll, I got 'nough control
Who needs a Grammy when you know you got soul?
I'm a smooth, yella, complexion Vanilla
High low, Afro, intelligent fella
You look worried, does something trouble ya?
We can take a ride in my heavy D M W
But let's wait till the rain stops
So you can  gimme what you want
And show me what you got
But for now, just snuggle me, snuggle me
Quit the chit chat, double up and snuggle lovin' me
You got the makings of a rainy day girl to me
So come a little closer, let's see, how it would be
(Let it rain)
I don't wanna go outside
(Let it rain)
I just wanna be with you
(Let it rain)
I don't feel like takin' a ride
(Let it rain)
You know what I wanna do
(Let it rain)
Girl, you makin' me sweat
(Let it rain)
Come close, let's see how far we can get
(Let it rain)
And I'll ease your pain
(Let it rain)
