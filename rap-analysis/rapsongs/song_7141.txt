I'm so done
I'm through
It's your fault
It's you 
CHORUS 
You can never ever say I ain't gave my love, 
You can never say I don't care, 
Since the beginning I've been here, I aint changed my love, 
Regardless of what you may feel, 
Us breaking up today would be a shame my love, 
But you make it such a good idea, 
But you won't show me that you appreciate my love, 
I had to say goodbye my dear. 
My dear my dear...Say goodbye my dear...my dear...
goodbye my dear say goodbye my dear my dear
I'm packin up boy I gotta leave, 
Gave you my heart and my soul, my everything, 
Spent so much time in the streets, 
You lied, you creeped, 
And I stayed here with you. 
Dont wanna do this to my family, 
They wanna see us together, living happily, 
But you are so unfair, you showed no care, 
And thats why I am through
All the pain, 
All these years, 
I hate to walk away, 
But I gotta say goodbye my dear, 
I'm so done wit you boy. 
CHORUS 
You can never ever say I ain't gave my love, 
You can never say I don't care, 
Since the beginning I've been here, I aint changed my love, 
Regardless of what you may feel, 
Us breaking up today would be a shame my love, 
But you make it such a good idea, 
But you won't show me that you appreciate my love, 
I had to say goodbye my dear. 
My dear my dear...Say goodbye my dear...my dear...
goodbye my dear say goodbye my dear my dear
T.I. 
We've been going through this so long, 
And you don't listen to me so now I'm showing you,
Think of when I'm gone you miss me more

CHORUS 
You can never ever say I ain't gave my love, 
You can never say I don't care, 
Since the beginning I've been here, I aint changed my love, 
Regardless of what you may feel, 
Us breaking up today would be a shame my love, 
But you make it such a good idea, 
But you won't show me that you appreciate my love, 
I had to say goodbye my dear. 
My dear my dear...Say goodbye my dear...my dear...

First we fuss and we fight and we break up
then we kiss and make love and we make up
Do this over and over but no more

CHORUS 
You can never ever say I ain't gave my love, 
You can never say I don't care, 
Since the beginning I've been here, I aint changed my love, 
Regardless of what you may feel, 
Us breaking up today would be a shame my love, 
But you make it such a good idea, 
But you won't show me that you appreciate my love,
