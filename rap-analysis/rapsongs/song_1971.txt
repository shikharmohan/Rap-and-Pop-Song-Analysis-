Yeah 
Uh 
Ye ye yeah 
That real s*** dog 
Grrrrrrrr 
Can't stop gotta eat, steppin' 
On my feet, spread 
Love thinking sweet, uh uh uh 
What you catz don't know 
(Repeat) 
Yeah baby shits about to jump off 
Waitin' for the bust, springing my man from up north 
Been like three years when he got knocked 
Since he got caught 
Pumped up like five new blocks 
Holdin' it down for him 
Keeping straight rippin 
Money on the books it ain't its crooks 
Who look out for other crooks 
Took him shoppin, money in his pocket 
He's straight, dropped him off at the wifes crib after we ate 
Out of state was the next move for me 
Had to make that nigga chill for at least 
Two to three months but once its on its on 
He didn't care its like "slow down baby the money aint goin 
nowhere." 
Keep in touch though and show how much yo ass is with it 
The dough flow is there and in a minute you can get it 
You got to watch a nigga just comin home in his game 
Cause on the low he might be tryin to go against the grain 
Can't stop gotta eat, steppin' 
On my feet, spread 
Love thinking sweet, uh uh uh 
What you catz don't know 
(Repeat) 
I never figured this nigga for the shit that he pulled 
What is strange is the change some niggas go through 
When they locked down they really cant hack it 
Mo'fucka like me handles the bid like a jacket 
Strap it on my back, but niggaz aint built like me 
And botherin niggaz is like "yo why you killed Mike D?" 
"Wasn't me, but yeah he had it comin to him, 
he used to be my dog, so I let my cousin do him." 
Sent him out of state with like half a brick down to my spot 
In VA cause the money comes quick 
Half of that got fucked up before I even got to check in on him 
But things happen so I really wasn't wreckin on him 
Got him up out of there, sent him down a little further 
Aint heard from him in two months, murda, murda 
Hopped on the next flight thinkin' I might have to steal 
somethin' 
This hungry shit will make a nigga wanna kill somethin' 
Can't stop gotta eat, steppin' 
On my feet, spread 
Love thinking sweet, uh uh uh 
What you catz don't know 
(Repeat) 
Listen, Money is missing and its hectic 
Found the safe, checked it, shit looks neglected 
Just what I expected, when I got no word from him 
Asked around, but ain't nobody heard from him 
But money talks, and most niggaz is snakes 
So it wasn't long before his man was ready to take 
Me to where he was at, checked my gat 
Threw in the .4 clip, pumped myself up 
Cause I cant go for that bullshit 
Fuckin' with my last, no the cash ain't the issue 
Its just real fucked up when your man tries to diss you 
Thinking back to niggaz in new york, and how they told me so: 
"Yo I gots to knock his boots, he owes me dough." 
Layin over da ho, then he hit me with the sob story 
The famous "Oh you didn't know, I got robbed." story 
Told him this way, "You should be grateful too." 
"Fuck that bitch, look at what she made you do." 
Now theres love lost in a double cross 
Pointed at that bitch, turned her brains into sauce 
"So you wanna be with me, and talk to me like I'm silly" 
Five bottles of "mo" on the floor, boxes of phillies 
Ten G's in a shoebox under the bed 
And for every G I put a fuckin slug in his head 
Now from Daniel, the moral to the story if you missed it 
Is the grain will always be there, just never go against it 
Can't stop gotta eat, steppin' 
On my feet, spread 
Love thinking sweet, uh uh uh 
What you catz don't know 
Can't stop gotta eat, steppin' 
On my feet, spread 
Love thinking sweet, uh uh uh 
So you catz don't know 
You catz must not know
