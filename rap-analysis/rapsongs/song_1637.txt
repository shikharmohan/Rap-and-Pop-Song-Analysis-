[After a bunch of P-Funk, Del kicks one verse]
I've returned from the meadow with a fellow named X
two turntables and a spark upon his set
wet behind the ears from the tears of my peers
rap is outta control that's what we fear
so we collapse any actual threats
with the new batch of catchy little quirks
and it works like a charm as I bomb and alarm
any listeners
coming through crisper
on your transistors
so we can eliminate the frauds
filled with pride as the audience applauds
might sound odd to the average Joe Schmoe
the new school passed ya ass like Flo Jo
Dodo
me and CM-PX both construct
like Kid Creole and the Coconuts
as we drop the bomb with a blast
and now all the natives ask...
[Chorus: "What is a booty and how do I know if I'm shaking it?. . .]
