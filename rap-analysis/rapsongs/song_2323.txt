Hey, yella , kick that shit, 199 muthafuckin' E
The muthafuckin year of the real muthafuckin' G's
And we gonna do this shit like this
Nigga eva deadly, ya just don't know who ya fuckin' wit
So I suggest get in ya shit and keep truckin' bitch
Before I get my gat ya pressure case
Blast, blast I leave my gang bang layin' on ya face
I tattooed Dre name on my chest
Cross it out just another nigga that I X-ed, huh
And you won't see R.I.P., you'll see P.N.D.
A punk nigga deceased, yeah
And the bitch that was yours will be mine buddy
All because ya woofed on a nigga that was nutty
And I had to make an example
Nigga thinks I'm crazy now but that was just a sample
Of a nigga with street wise reality
That don't give a fuck type Compton mentality
I stare back death right in the face
Contemplate my last day on and everyday base
'Cause a nigga neva know when he go
I hope it only takes one shot
'Cause I don't wanna die slow
My funeral will be full of my peers
People that neva gave a fuck about me droppin'
Threw me tears, I hope I'm in the casket face down
So all you muthafuckaz can kiss my black ass now
And fuck all that cryin' all night
Just be happy that I'm rid of this fucked up life
Yeah, and now you see you can't handle me
I give a shout to Tonel and the Ruthless fuckin Family
Out wit the old in with the muthafuckin' new
But check dis shit out I got somebody for ya bitch
Muthafucka
Now it's about time for the Sylk to speak
Check dat ass last weak
You off the chronic and you tweak
Speak when I feel
'Cause I'm as real as they come, I'm a bitch with a gun
Neva run ain't for none, so step, step up
if ya wanna test ya luck trick, sister like Sylk
Don't really giva a fuck bitch
Punk bitches wanna step phony speak howdy doody
I make ya self break ya self bitch you neva new me
Yours truly no longer layin' in the cut, steady fuckin' shit up
Neva see me shakin' my butt, I strut like a gangsta, bitch
No, not a pranksta bitch, I'm quick to gank a bitch trick
Peep game at this bitch as I shoot this gangsta, bitch
Steppin' rollin' wit da Ruthless
The R U T H L E double S,  yo it's the nigga knocc out
Claim the block so nigga what's next? Try to step and flex
And get wrecked like a mac truck, I'm kickin', tah spittin'
This funky shit to make a quick phat buck
I'm doggin' a dog you suckaz can't talk bout tip flip I rip shit
I'm stressin', 'Damn 'Cause', 'Pick It Back Up'
Chillin up in the studio with the Ruthless Family
Fuck the Death Row Posse, yo them fools cannot handle me
Snoop and Andre ya come and try to fade the
Loc'ed out, Compton, Original Baby Gangsta
1 8 7's how we do it on the West
Ya say ya shit is Chronic but to me it's more like stress
Or should I say make my shit the stronic
Tha Dogg Pound don't wanna step to the atomic dog
D O T K N O Double C O U T so muthafucka come and fuck wit me
Come on, come on
This is just a little something to keep ya ass in check
Ruthless muthafuckin' Family ya still in effect
Ruthless muthafuckin' Family ya still in effect
Ruthless muthafuckin' Family ya still in effect
This is just a little something to keep ya ass in check
Ruthless muthafuckin' Family, 'Kick That Shit'
Jealousy is a muthafucka when your the man
With the other hand I don't give a shit, clock a grip like no other can
Wanna be like me be a G like me but I'm the nigga that made a G
Outta the bitch D-R Eazy, I was the captain
Dre was my sidekick, everything was cool
Till he wanted to get what I get
Any other real G Eazy, muthafuckin' E
Now claimin' you a G, how does it feel to be me?
