Oh god my eyes they water like a preacher whos sinned
I'm only human but, the world has put me on a platform since the day I was born to only wait for my downfall but like a brick wall I'm too hard to break. 
Okay I do make mistakes but I'm the realest from the fake.
Thats why I'm the hardest to hate. 
Aaliyah baby girl I've learned to love those why they're still awake sleep sleep
And prepare a place for those who are good in the projects and hood

I am a leader, teacher, a guider, like a single parent provider
puttin back those hiphop dividers like a priest with a back slider. 
I sin but I win
And anyone we've lost in life in 9/11 we'll be sure to see again
