Who is the man with the masterplan?
A nigga witta motherfuckin' gun
44 reasons come to mind
Why you motherfuckin' brother's hard to find
He been walkin' on the streets and fuckin' with mine
Stupid punk can't fuck with a mastermind
See I never take a step on a Compton block
Or LA without the AK ready to pop
'Cos them punk motherfuckers in black and white
Ain't the only motherfuckers I gots to fight
I thinks it's better to be tellin' the facts than cuffed up
And jacked and fucked up
What you niggas lookin' at? You goin'
Goddamn 'cos it's the city
And for you to survive, a nigga gotta be a gangsta
And I'm a nigga you can't remove
Took out a lot of motherfuckers for tryin' to prove
To their homies they can hang by dealin' with me
But once again in the end they D E A D
I never did time on a murder yet
'Cos I relax and back, do a job and jet
Yo, I know you understand my flow
So here we go with Death Row
Come let a motherfucker know
Who is the man with the masterplan?
A nigga witta motherfuckin' gun
Who is the man with the masterplan?
A nigga witta motherfuckin' gun
D R E
A motherfucker who's known for carryin' gats
And kick raps that make snaps
Adapts to any environment that I'm located at
If you see me on the solo move, best believe that I'm strapped
44, .tre-8 or AK-47
'Cos slowly but surely send you on a stairway to heaven
Just put my finger on the trigger and pull back
And lay a punk motherfucker flat
As he wonder what popped before he got popped
I told you I was Dre and you know it don't stop
Now I know you understand my flow
So here we go with Death Row
Come let a motherfucker know

A nigga witta motherfuckin' gun
I breaks 'em off, I breaks 'em off, yeah
I breaks 'em off, I breaks 'em off, yeah
I breaks 'em off but I ain't speakin' about between the thighs
I'm talkin' about cockin' a gauge in between your eyes
That'll make you drop to your knees 'cos you realize
That a gat will make any nigga civilized
Old buster ass nigga talkin' bullshit
Don't know that I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
Get lit or hit up by the doctor
A nigga that breaks 'em off properly
Real G, so don't doubt it
I'm the one who's doin' it while these other niggas talk about it
And if motherfuckers come at me wrong
I straight put my .44 Desert Eagle to his motherfuckin' dome
And show him why they call me the notorious one
The name is Dre Eastwood when I'm packin' a gun
You don't believe me, well, step up and give it a try
And if you die youse a buster 'cos real niggas don't die
But some still don't hear me though
You're too near me not to hear me, nigga yo
