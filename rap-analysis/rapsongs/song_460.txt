'Cause I'm a 'Thug By Nature', strictly for the paper
Ain't nobody steppin' to Steve
I come with the ones, I come with the Thugs

It's still an 'Everyday Thang' for me to let my nuts hang
You want a performance worth the ticket if the price right we can kick it
Like a lip, I'ma hit it, party on I gots to get it
Keep them foxy women baggin' it up
While them haters stayin actin' up
You flashin' what? I'm flashin' frosty nuts
Girl if you come and take a ride with me
And if you ridin' with me, sit back recline in yo' seat
'Cause in the world where I'm from the sun always shine
And even though a nigga don't want it baby the world is mines, c'mon
