You're just too good to be true, can't take my eyes off you
You'd be like heaven to touch, I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived and I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true, can't take my eyes off you
Pardon the way that I stare, there's nothing else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak, there are no words left to speak
But if you feel like I feel, please let me know that it's real
You're just too good to be true, can't take my eyes off you
I need you baby and if it's quite all right
I need you baby to warm a lonely night
I love you baby, trust in me when I say
Oh pretty baby, don't bring me down I pray
Oh pretty baby, now that I found you, stay
And let me love you, oh baby, let me love you, oh baby
You're just too good to be true, can't take my eyes off you
You'd be like heaven to touch, I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived and I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true, can't take my eyes off you
I need you baby and if it's quite all right
I need you baby to warm a lonely night
I love you baby, trust in me when I say
Oh pretty baby, don't bring me down I pray
Oh pretty baby, now that I found you, stay
And let me love you, oh baby, let me love you, oh baby
I need you baby and if it's quite all right
I need you baby to warm a lonely night
I love you baby, trust in me when I say
Oh pretty baby, don't bring me down I pray
Oh pretty baby, now that I found you, stay
And let me love you, oh baby let me love you, oh baby
