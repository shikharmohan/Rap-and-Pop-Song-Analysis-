[Chorus]
My chick bad

My chick do stuff dat yo' chick wish she could
My chick bad
My chick hood
My chick do stuff dat yo' chick wish she could
My chick bad, badder than yours

[Ludacris - Verse 1]
I'm saying my chick bad
My chick hood
My chick do stuff that yo' chick wish she could
My chick bad, badder than yours
My chick do stuff that I can't even put in words
Her swagger don't stop
Her body won't quit
So fool pipe down ye ain't talkin' 'bout shit 
My chick bad, tell me if you seen her
She always bring the racket like Venus and Serena
All white top, all white belt
And all white jeans, body lookin' like milk
No time for games, she's full grown
My chick bad, tell your chick to go home
[Chorus]
My chick bad
My chick hood
My chick do stuff dat yo' chick wish she could
My chick bad 
My chick hood 
My chick do stuff dat yo' chick wish she could
My chick bad, badder than yours
My my chick bad, badder than yours
My my my chick bad, badder than yours
[Ludacris - Verse 2]
Now your girl might be sick but my girl be sicker
She rides that dick and she handles her liquor
She knock a bitch out aaaand fight
Coming out swinging like Tiger Wood's wife
Yeah she could get a little hasty
Chicks better cover up there chests like pasties
Couple girlfriends and they all a little crazy
Coming down the street like a parade Macy*s
I fill her up balloons
Test her and guns get drawn like cartoons
Doh, but I ain't talkin' 'bout Homer
Chick so bad the whole crew wanna bone her
[Chorus]
My chick bad
My chick hood
My chick do stuff dat yo' chick wish she could
My chick bad
My chick hood
My chick do stuff dat yo' chick wish she could
My chick bad, badder than yours
My my chick bad, badder than yours
My my my chick bad, badder than yours
[Nicki Minaj]
Yo, now all these bitches wanna try and be my besty
But I take a left and leave them hanging like a testi
Trash talk to 'em then I put 'em in a Hefty
Running down the court I'm dunkin' on 'em Lisa Leslie
It's going down, basement, Friday 13th guess who's playing Jason
Tuck yourself in you better hold on to your teddy
It's Nightmare on Elm street and guess who's playing Freddy
(My chick bad)
Chef cooking for me, they say my shoe game crazy
The mental asylum looking for me
You a rookie to me
I'm in dat wam Bam purple Lamb' damn bitch you been a fan.
[Chorus]
My chick bad
My chick hood
My chick do stuff dat yo' chick wish she could
My chick bad 
My chick hood
My chick do stuff dat yo' chick wish she could
My chick bad, badder than yours
My my chick bad, badder than yours
My my my chick bad, badder than yours
