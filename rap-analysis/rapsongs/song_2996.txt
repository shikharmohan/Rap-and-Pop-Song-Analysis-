How can I promise you forever
When I can't even promise the rest of the day
All I know is we started this journey together
And hopefully we can make it the rest of the way
Inshallah
Inshallah, Inshallah
Inshallah
Inshallah, Inshallah
Inshallah
Yeah, dialect kinda slurred
Did you catch that word blurred
Talk slow, walk slow
And years passed
Make that cash
Never took a second look
Follow the words in the book
Watch 'em chill and cook
Somethin' new for your ears, bro
Sing along same sing song
Wantin' to bail out the front door
Which you lookin' at me more
I can show you shit that you never seen before
Crushed ice for cold drinks
Surely makin' music for the worldly
And the people in it if you gotta spin it
Life is only five minutes
We got contra banded
I recite about bein' free only to a certain extent
In a country run by a president
That doesn't know a single resident
In my 'hood it is good
Or that is fucked up
I let 'em speak for me
Break bread and peace treaty
Across seas [unverified]
Till the feds get it and split it
With other federals and [unverified] agents and senators
And representatives that live off us
And feed off us
For new ides for years
Niggaz been raped
Let's escape
This dope but how?
When it's locked into our chemistry for
'Cause nigga that's all we know
That's how we grow
How can I promise you forever
When I can't even promise the rest of the day
All I know is we started this journey together
And hopefully we can make it the rest of the way
Remember me, I explain
Our relentless hip
[Unverified] while true made me get the grain?
And I refuse to settle
Well except the simple and plain
I'd much rather excite
Delight and entertain
Passionately persistent
When I preach this positivity
For stand up God, write hard things I like to say
And our words don't take a chance
See if I can make y'all dance
But I really ain't got that much time to play
Just row
Your little boat down the stream
Go slow
'Cause life is only a dream and if I should die before I awake
I leave to all my beloved this message to take
Ahh, the merciful Lord of worlds
Master of the days of judgment guide me on the path
Upon those who you bestowed your favors
Not upon those who your wrath has brought down
Nor on those who go astray after hearing your teachings
Confidence shot, selfless thing go extremely contagious flavor
Distributed in major tomatoes with juice
Chances of prostate cancer
Disease is fictitious
Never abandon your Emmanuel for want of religion
Kept peasants 180 just got back
From what it ain't nothin' but gamblin'
In the pockets scramblin'
To avoid the sack I'm seldom seen
'Cause I'm on the label
No dis boneless fingers go from
For the one
In a matter of tone
A target of since sense has made me enemies
It has performance in demand
Violence, a tradition in the Western hemisphere
Claim jumpers and land jacker
How can I promise you forever
When I can't even promise the rest of the day
All I know is we started this journey together
And hopefully we can make it the rest of the way
