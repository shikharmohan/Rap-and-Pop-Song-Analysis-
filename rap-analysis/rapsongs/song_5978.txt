Diddy
Spoken:
Yea, it's bad boy baby!(yeah, c'mon)
Neptunes, and we won't stop baby
'cause we can't stop, yea
Let me tell you something
Verse 1:
Sometimes I rhyme slow
Sometimes I rhyme quick
I was on 1-2-5 and saint nick (uh)
Chillin wit this chick named tanya delayda
Was a hot girl and everybody wanted to slay her
'cause she wasn't fond of playas, only wanted ballas
A spoilla, six-figures, and camcordas
So what you tryna tell me dear? 
I got bentley, benson, and mr. belvedere (yeah)
And I just wanna blow ya mind (uh huh)
I'm talking really really blow ya mind
My repetoire is menage a trois and exotic cars
Chillin wit da hottest stars
And it ain't no stop to this
I can't help but I'm an optimist
And i'ma make your head bob to this
And at the end you gon rock to this
Now say my name, c'mon
Chorus:
The d, the i, the d, the d, the y, the d, the i, the d is diddy (hold up)
Is diddy (c'mon,that shit's crazy)
The d, the i, the d, the d, the y, the d, the I , the d is diddy
(hold up) is diddy (say what!)
Verse 2:
Hey yo, I came in the door
I said it before
I never let the ladies hypnotize me no more
But, went back to the manuscript
'cause I don't think you can handle this
From new york to los angeles
I think the whole world scandalous
I'm just trying to keep the candles lit
Let the party people dance to this
Get out your seats and clap to this
Because I came to far for me to be bourgeois
It's a bentley to you but to me it's a blue car (that's right)
So branson pass me a jar
'cause these cats don went too far (whoo)
Ur one phone call to send 2 cars
And I still get searched by security guards (that's right)
I guess that's what I have to do
Taking game international
Now what y'all call me
Back to chorus
Subchorus: (2x's)
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
C'mon,work it out girl
I wanna see ya work it out girl
Verse 3:
Now hold up, stop (stop) now wait a minute (c'mon)
We don't stop 'cause we rock 'cause it ain't a limit (let's go)
My aim is winnin, got asian women
That'll change my linen after I den blazed and hit em, what (c'mon)
And I just wanna rock wit you (that's right)
And take it straight to the top with you (let's go)
And do what I gots to do, if it's possible
'cause I ain't tryna stop ya boo (uh huh)
Got an agenda (yeah)
Got on a ninja (yeah)
One willin to killin it
But not to offend ya (uh)
That's when I met this chick named brenda
Tenda, her whole body bend like fenda (that's right)
So let me see ya shake it girl (c'mon)
I just wanna see ya shake it girl (c'mon)
For the return of the don
The world in my palm (yeah)

But y'all call me.... (let's go)
Back to chorus then subchorus until fade
