Intro: Notorious B.I.G. 
One one two 
Check me out right here yo 
Verse One: Puff Daddy 
Yo the sun don't shine forever 
(BIG: You can turn the track up a little bit for me) 
Turn me up yo 
Can you here me? 
But as long as it's here then we might as well shine together 
(BIG: All up in my ears) 
Better now than never business before pleasure 
(BIG: The mic is loud but the beats isn't loud) 
P-Diddy and the Fam, who you know do it better? 
Yeah right, no matter what, we air tight 
(BIG: YEAH!) 
So when you hear somethin, make sure you hear it right 
Don't make a ass outta yourself, by assumin 
(BIG: YEAH! Now the mic is lower, turn the mics up) 
Our music keeps you movin, what are you provin? 
(BIG: Turn that shit all the way up, yeah) 
You know that I'm two levels above you baby 
(BIG: Music's gettin louder) 
Hug me baby, I'ma make you love me baby 
(BIG: This shit is hot!) 
Talkin crazy ain't gonna get you nuthin but choked 
(BIG: Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh) 
And that jealousy is only gonna leave you broke 
So the only thing left now is God for these cats 
And BIG you know you too hard for these cats 
I'm a win cause I'm too smart for these cats 
While they makin up facts (uhh) you rakin up plats 
Verse Two: Notorious B.I.G. 
In a Commision, you ask for permission to hit em 
He don't like me, him and wild wifey was wit em 
You heard of us, the murderous, most shady 
Been on the low lately, the feds hate me 
The son of satan 
They say my killin's too blatant 
You hesitatin, I'm in your mama crib waitin 
Duct tapin, your fam destiny 
lays in my hands, gat lays in my waist 
Francis, M to the iz-H phenominal 
Gun rest under your vest by the abdominal 
Rob a few bars so I can buy a few cars 
And I kick a few flows so I can pimp a few hoes 
Excellence is my presence, never tense 
Never hesitant, leave a nigga bent real quick 
Real sick, brawl nights, I perform like Mike 
Anyone -- Tyson, Jordan, Jackson 
action, pack guns, ridiculous 
And I'm, quick to bust, if my ends you touch 
Kids or girl you touch, in this world I clutch 
Two auto-matoes, used to call me fatso 
Now you call me Castro, my rap flows 
militant, y'all faggots ain't killin shit 
Ooops Cristal keep spillin shit, you overdid it homes 
You in the danger zone, you shouldn't be alone 
Hold hands and say it like me 
The most shady, Frankie baby, fantastic 
Graphic, tryin to make dough, like Jurassic 
Parked in quick to spark kids who start shit 
See me, only me 
The Underboss of this holocaust 
Truly yours, Frank White 
Chorus: Busta Rhymes 
We got the real live shit from front to back 
To my people in the world, where the fuck you at? 
Where my niggaz is at? (2X) 
Where the fuck my bitches at? 
Where my bitches is at? 
(repeat all 2X) 
Verse Three: Puff Daddy 
Put your money on the table and get your math on 
Break it down, split it up, get your laugh on 
See you later Dog, I'ma get my stash on 
There's a bed full of money that I get my ass on 
I never lose the passion to go platinum 
Said I'd live it up til all the cash gone 
Ain't that funny, only use plastic, craft it 
to make classics, hotter than acid 
P-D, rollin on your tape or CD 
The Billboard killa, no team illa 
The Fam-o, ammo, is every channel 
We been hot for a long time burnin like a candle 
What you can do is check your distribution 
My songs bump in Houston like Scarface produced em 
You ain't gotta like me, you just mad 
Cause I tell it how it is, and you tell it how it might be 
Verse Four: Notorious B.I.G. 
We got the shit, Mac tight, brass knuckles and flashlights 
The heaers in the two-seaters, with two midas 
Senoritas, kiss rings when you meet us 
P-Diddy run the city, show no pity 
I'm the witty one, Frank's the crook from the Brook' 
Matty broke the neck of your coke connect 
No respect squeeze off til all y'all diminish 
Shootouts for twenty minutes, until we finish 
Venice took the loot, escaped, in the Coupe 
Break bread, with the kiss, Peniro, sheek loops 
Black Rob joined the mob, it ain't no replacin him 
Niggaz step up, we just macin them 
placin them in funerals, criminals turned aroused 
The Brick City, nobody come off like P-Diddy 
Business rise, I play men 
Hide money on the Island Cayman, y'all just betray men 
You screamin, I position, competition 
Nother day in the life of the Comission 
Chorus 2X w/ Puff talking 
Aiyyo, can you hear me out there? 
Aiyyo turn me up, nobody can hear me out there 
That's good, it's all fucked up now 
Y'all know it's all fucked up now right? 
What the fuck y'all gonna do now? 
What I'ma do now? 
Can y'all hear me out there? 
Can y'all hear me out there? 
(?) Fuck y'all niggaz wanna do 
It's all fucked up now 
What I'ma do now, huh? 
What I'ma do now 
It's all fucked up now
