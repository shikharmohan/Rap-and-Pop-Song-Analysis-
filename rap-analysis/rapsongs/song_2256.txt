Orange juice and absolut vodka
(To da beat)
Smokin' on a beadie, chasin' it with a fat strike in my
Fresh off the showroom flexing 32 valve North star Caddy
(To da beat)
Gettin' it cricket, slangin' 'em sideways, walkin' up the streets
Residuals, re-enactments, constantly repeatedly burnin' vogues
(To da beat)
Flamboastin', high sidin', turnin' heads, rewindin'
Ain't had the car but two weeks and already need a wheel alignment
(To da beat)
See us bay Negroes is nigger ain't give a fuck
Flip a spankin' new vehicle, tear it up

Ah-cho-ah-chokin' on some burner, in my little deuce, white interior
Smoke gray exterior, convertible rag top hummer
(To da beat)
Little homey ain't but sixteen years and a millionaire
Sittin' on somethin' clever talkin' about, 40 water can you help me out?
Can you give me some kind of advice
'Cause I ain't tryin' to be up in this bitch forever?
(To da beat)
Told all my motherfuckers to try to wash they monies
And make some kind of good out of bad, buy you a couple offixer uppers
Shit it ain't gotta be no brand new Caddy
(To da beat)
Use da dope game as a stepping stone, let your little sister run it
Turn one of the fixer-uppers into a care home, I'da done it
(To da beat)
Where I'm from, Vallejo California born and raised in crew
We got the highest paid police force, look what they do
(To da beat)
Too busy tryin' to scrutinize and slander me
As much as I done did for the community
(To da beat)
Do me a favor why don't you go out of state and go visit
Some of your family members down South and mention Vallejo
And I bet the first thing that come up out their mouth
Is Earl Stevens and Danell, bump this shit 'til your tape break
And you're a bitch if you didn't buy my last tape, Beotch

Straight up, this ain't no circus, playboys and girls
Listen up, we's 'bout to get on turbans, boom boom
  (To da beat)
Woofers in the back boom boom! Niggaz and bitches talkin' 'bout
Did you hear that nigga 40 water new shit?
That nigga got the slack!
(To da beat)
You can pat that nigga down with a metal detector
And still not have a clue
Fools be slidin' up in parties on crutches
Limpin', with a derringer in his shoe
(To da beat)
Fuck a Cuban cigar, give me a black and mild
Then watch me tear up a brand new hundred dollar bill
And throw it in the crowd
(To da beat)
I don't need no iron, I'm already crisp
(Whatchu got, whatchu got, whatchu got)
I don't need no money, I got mouthpiece
(To da beat)
Closed mouth tank get fed, dude what you talkin' here, what
All of a sudden you got amnesia nigga
I know you didn't forget who buttered your bread
(To da beat)
