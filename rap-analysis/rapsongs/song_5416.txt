To the beat y'all, play that beat
To the beat y'all, play that beat
To the beat y'all, play that beat
To the beat y'all, play that beat
To the beat y'all, play that beat
(This is a Missy Elliott exclusive)
When you wanna go around the world
  (I'm ready)
And if you want me to fight your ex-girl for you
  (I'm ready, I'm ready)
If you need me to cook you meals
  (I'm ready)
And if you want me to come and chill with you, boy
  (Suga' I'm ready)
You don't know, how you got me
I've never been in so, but not me
I'm the one who's own like to be
Givin' up the eow easy
Something you do, reminds me
Friends be tryin' to stop me
They can't believe you got me
Givin' up the eow easy
When you need a backrub from workin' all day
  (I'm ready)
Uhh, when you need a chick to come over right away
  (I'm ready like this)
When you need me to wash your clothes, boy
  (I'm ready)
When you need me on the phone to curse out the hoes
  (Suga' I'm ready, I'm ready)
You don't know how you got me
I've never been in so, but not me
I'm the one who's own like to be
Givin' up the eow easy
Something you do, reminds me
Friends be tryin' to stop me
They can't believe you got me
Givin' up the eow easy
Boy, there ain't none quite like you
Ask me and I'll always do
'Cause I got this thing for you
You know what a cat can do
Boy there ain't none quite like you
Ask me and I'll always do
'Cause I got this thing for you
You know what a eow can do
You don't know how you got me
I've never been in so, but not me
I'm the one who's own like to be
Givin' up the eow easy
Something you do reminds me
Friends be tryin' to stop me
They can't believe you got me
Givin' up the eow easy
I'm ready, when your baby momma trips
So just call me, come in doin' backwards flips
My darling, would you like me bust her lips
'Cause I'm ready, show you I'm the realest chick
And I love you, I'll do what you want me to do
I said I love you ,for you I'm more than a crew
I'm Mrs. Do-right, can't go wrong with me
I said R.E.D.Y, always on time
Come on
