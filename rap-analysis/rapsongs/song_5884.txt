Meanin' I'm fienin', your heart trips when it stay at work
So fuck, fear you fear, fuck, one jerk I'll make your head hurt
The punani, they're making pairs perk, who'll dare flirt
I get kitty's from your city, just near where your man's work
I be on that ass like ol' mole, turnin' your whole show slow-mo
'Cos you're too good to corroso
I'm on and off so you know my shit ain't partial
Pardon me, packin' arsenals, takin' knees and nostrils
Our style is savagery, you try to be the badder G
You ain't even the man, you just the filling, where's the cavity?
Father be grabbin' it, gravity, have the gravity grabbin'
Actually after we nigga naturally have to meet

One check to the chin and you'll be bust quicker than liquor
Aw shit, pop her chain and lock her rock, a city slicker
Slick a rhyme, kick or vick her, knock her without a popper
I take the cake, took the chain but left the lock up
Love me or leave me, hate me or like me
Might be gettin' feisty, fuck yeah I'm sheisty
Shit yeah, I fit there, [unverified] your shit wear
You're a trick until you niggered me a bitch without liquid
Some thank me for puttin' the hanky in panky
Slappin' stanky like lightning, stickin' Yankees like Benjamin Franky
Fuck buyin' kitty cases and city lights
Just give my loot, get your licks and get all the high titties right
But then, I'm into what you bitches is sayin'
So I wasn't really feelin' on her ass, I was just massagin' her brain
The objects that I learned from the projects
Try Treach I bet, and get your throat choked like my necks
'Cos it's a slang bang thang
Slang bang, it's a slang bang thang, a slang bang thang
'Cos it's a slang bang thang
Slang bang, it's a slang bang thang, a slang bang thang
My mind thinks right, [unverified] pick snipes
Don't pluck, I'll fuck your finger
At any [unverified] prejudice Presley [unverified]
Now I got more snipes than Wesley
Test me, touch me and lay next to the rest of the best
The rusty monks or [unverified] who tried to fuck me
But see this is where I boom and zoom
Just drive a line like a cartoonist on some soon shit
Adidas couldn't read us so they freed us
Then we tried Reebok from a cheater, succeeded then got weeded
Oh Anna, rip of some grandma's, no my Grandma from Santa Ana
To Atlanta where cops ain't a-feared and niggas wear 'dannas
Now tell ya lady that I'm crazy when I'm summin'
There's a party and I'm out and guess who's comin'
'Cos it's a slang bang thang

Everybody can get down with the slang bang
We doin' rhyme-bys on record
Ha ha ha ha, woo wee
