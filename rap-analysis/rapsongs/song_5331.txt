I met him in the Bahamas, I love that persona
Switch it marijuana, you freaky call me Madonna
Lay on the bed he follow, bone him until tomorrow
Make him sing high soprano
Fifty fo' fifty fifty, Mr. Act Super Kinky
Baby what you gon' get me? Is it some rings for my lil' Pinkie?
Money will multiply, 'fore you run up inside
Make me all weak and tired
You gotta
(Scream)
If you up in the club, you think you tearin' it up, you gotta
(Scream)
Well pour most of the liquor, then you watchin' people buzz, you gotta

If you from out of town, you think you're holdin' it down, you gotta

Makin' heads scream and moan, send 'em back home

Give me that l-l-liquor, liquor, make me talk slurry, slurry
Money will multiply before you run up inside
Get me all weak and tired
You gotta

You gotta, you gotta
He asked could he rock my body?
He also asked could he buy me a drink?
Six oh Ferrari, then ride up in my Safari
What a deal word up, how much it cost now?
What the deal word up, how much it cost?
Play your position listen where is your pot to piss in?
Before we start really kissin', hot as freaky kitchen
Hey what the deal word up, how much it cost now?
Hey what the deal word up, how much it cost now?
You gotta
