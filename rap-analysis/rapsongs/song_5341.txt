I'm moving on can't nothing stop me now
I'm pressing on to higher ground
Each step I take is the new dawning of
A brand new day for higher ground
Obstacles and situations, people, places and things
I must overcome for there's a battle to be won
With my mind set on higher things
These things have become my footstool
I'm determined to reach my goal I need peace for my soul, oh
I'm moving on can't nothing stop me now
I'm pressing on to higher ground
Each step I take is the new dawning of
A brand new day for higher ground
I'm pressing on the upward way
Brand new heights I'm gaining everyday
No higher place that I really have found
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground
Forgetting what is already behind me
I'm moving forward for what's ahead
I'm moving on can't nothing stop me now
I'm pressing on to higher ground
Each step I take is the new dawning of
A brand new day for higher ground
The race is not given to the swift
Nor the battle to the strong
But it's to the one that endureth
But we gotta stand strong and fight on
Sometimes you feel like your foot might slip
'Cause there's too much going on
Just realize your goal is greater than your struggle
Hold on and be strong
I'm moving on can't nothing stop me now
I'm pressing on to higher ground
Each step I take is the new dawning of
A brand new day for higher ground
I'm moving on can't nothing stop me now
I'm pressing on to higher ground
Each step I take is the new dawning of
A brand new day for higher ground
Be strong and fight on but by all means keep moving on
I'm a witness, I'm a witness
For Jesus, nobody but Jesus
When I was down and no one was there
He picked me up and He carried me, He carried me
I'm a witness, I'm a witness
For Jesus, nobody but Jesus
When I was down and no one was there
He picked me up and He carried me, He carried me
