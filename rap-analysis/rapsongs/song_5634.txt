Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's all on my motherfukin' niggaz
Y'knowhamsayin'? Word up, and to all my niggaz too
It's word up, son
For them other niggas on home y'knowhamsayin'?
I got my clique ready, ready for hand-to-hand combo
Harms break 'em down, rapper Noyd cut his throat
Don swoop 'em up or Gotti stomp 'em out
Each twin grab a arm, pick this nigga up
Knitty turn his face to me and let me break him up
I throw him up against the wall and put a hole in his face
So big, it almost took his whole face off
We got to take position, ready for face-off
With blitz like Dallas, ain't no Superbowl face-off
We form like niggas in the yard up north
With long swords, ready for war, who paid cost
And take ya life lost, never found again, boss
A job well done, relax, throw back fifths
Of Bacardi Limon, fifteenths of hash get lit
Fuckin' with the fabulous Mobb, yeah, you were sick
Lunatic nigga, jump up or got hit
With max and teks and silencers spit
Shots whiz past your earlobe and shit
That's the sound of a nigga who almost felt it
Got you runnin', dodgin', coverin', shelterin'
Bullets rippin' through the fabric of your shirt, it's meltin' it
You bleed again, you just another nigga dealt with
Intruder alert, our house is nothin' like the Covenant
We hold big shit like a bitch hold one in the oven
Well, if it ain't drama, money above broke bitches
Simple minded niggas, Alpha have it positioned
That's opposition, wettin' me, competition
Suddenly and outta tha blue and now I see
Far myself, by myself and rollin' mad trees
Paranoid on point and now I see who's who
This thing was fake ones outta the immediate crew
Life, I take one if you jeopardize my do
You're small, minute, gotta death to deal with aces up
You over-bidded and in the Bridge, you got stuck
This ain't a card game but in perspective, it's the same
Put two and two together, Mobb Deep with one name
Contain drama like Outbreak
You order drama, we outtake, then take you out
Keep it real and throw the fake out
Raise the stakes up, hit you off from the waste up
It's how it is and how it is, it's kinda fucked up
Butter beats bangin', got ya whole clique singin'
On a corner while it's rainin', 4 pound left cha ears ringin'
Delete those and keep my shit discrete, niggas is trash rhyme
Totally offbeat and outta sync with they light
E&J; bent tight, niggas slow ya roll
Ya speedin', now ya bleedin' tonight for no reason
Wanna be max and does get smacked, show no love
Crush ya team like the bear hug
The Infamous'll do dirt, dead as smear like mud
New York new get-it-greens, I feel no pity, no remorse
Takin' it to the Source of course
Bare that ass thug real, kid, it's only your mask
That you wear, take off
Cop out feel the blast, boom
On top, boom boom, gat for gat
And all the rules got the drop on you
And let the nickel nine pop on you
Yo, my crew in the front got it locked
My live niggas in the back got the gats blowin' outta your back
What the deal, what them tough looks and eye contact?
Starin' all up in ya cornea, you cornea lack
The look of a true to life, crime niggas attack
Go at the first nigga that front and over-react
You get dealt with, dealt with quick
Opposition get melted by hot shit, he felt it
You get dealt with, dealt with quick
Opposition get melted by hot shit, he felt it
Dealt with quick
Opposition get melted by hot shit, he felt it
