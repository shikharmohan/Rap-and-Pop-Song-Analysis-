Say what? Say what? Say what?
I be that short temper, hostile rhyme bringer
Lifestyle gone wild, similar to rock singer
Check me on the big screen, livin' out my dreams
Cypress, Assassins, SX, latin thug thing
Fools think they get bad, I ain't really with that
Flavour of the month, bro, [Incomprehensible] try to dispatch
Always got the good badge, take it to the head
Got me wasted like Jerry from the Grateful Dead
Don't trip, get a grip, be strong an' don't fake it
Or else you get beat down an' stripped butt naked
I just kick the lyric, straight from the spirit
You can tell I got soul first time as you hear it
Welcome to the show, all come inside
An' you can hear proper sound when it's amplified
You wanna party with the best, say, "Fuck the rest"
'Cos we take away ya stress an' never settle for less
Welcome to the show, all come inside
An' you can hear proper sound when it's amplified
You wanna party with the best an' say, "Fuck the rest"
'Cos we take away ya stress an' never settle for less
When you deal with the Hill, keep your mouth sealed
If you rely on your skill then rely on your steel
If you have no ideal or any thoughts to feel
What you sought was real, to give 'em slots to fill
Busters stop to deal
But I face them, quicker than takin' a box of pills
Now you gots to chill, get cops an' sheilds
Steady, hark the fields, if they're lookin' for prey, ready to stalk an' kill
As I lock the wheel, don't you mock the drill
'Cos I'll cock my steel an' make you drop an' spill
Got no mercy unless you talk to deal
Quit talk an' kneel, you won't top my will, bitch
Welcome to the show, all come inside
An' you can hear proper sound when it's amplified
You wanna party with the best an' say, "Fuck the rest"
'Cos we take away ya stress an' never settle for less
Welcome to the show, all come inside
An' you can hear proper sound when it's amplified
You wanna party with the best an' say, "Fuck the rest"
'Cos we take away ya stress an' never settle for less
Say what? Say what? Say what?
Ain't nobody better, on that you can bet
Wanna see a dope show? Put your money on my set
Real emcees an' real DJs
Real South siders from the heart of L.A.
Now back in the day we had big sucess
An' it's like that now an' we won't settle for less
You can beat the LB from the new latin lingo
Nowadays you nothin' without a hit single
Time to get loco an' put bodies in motion
Hit the stage in a rage an' start up a commotion
No, I ain't jokin', see my mic smokin'
I slam it like the art an' make sure it's broken
Welcome to the show, all come inside
An' you can hear proper sound when it's amplified
You wanna party with the best, say, "Fuck the rest"
'Cos we take away ya stress an' never settle for less
Welcome to the show, all come inside
An' you can hear proper sound when it's amplified
You wanna party with the best, say, "Fuck the rest"
'Cos we take away ya stress an' never settle for less
