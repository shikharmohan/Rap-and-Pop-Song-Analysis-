What type of games is being played, how's it going down? 
If it's on till it's gone, then I gots to know now 
Is you wit me or what, they gon try to give me a nutt 
Just honeys wanna give me the butt, wha.. 
I'm politicking with this chicken and wondering if I'ma creep her 
Little hoodrat Bitch from 25th named Tamika 
Coming through, like I do, you know 
Getting my bark on 
Knew she was a thug because when I met her she had a scarf on 
54/11 size 7 in girls 
Babyface, would look like she was 11 with curls 
Girlfriend,(what?) remember me, from way back, I'm the same cat 
With the wave cap the motherfucker that TNT used to blaze at 
Still here, so it's all good 
Oh you know my niggaz Rich and them doing they thing on 35th Ave 
It's a small hood, and it's all wood, so let me get that number 
Hook it up, aight 
Hit you on da track later on, see wassup 
Talking to shorty made me wanna do something nice 
Looking at that ass made me wanna do something tonight 
And I know right when I see right, shorty looking like she tight 
She bite, better give a nigga the green light, we might..

I'm lookin at shorty like what you need, what you want 
Offer nothing, 'cause I got you, must you front? 
I see you with your baby father but it don't matter 
You gave me the pussy, that ass is getting fatter 
Let that nigga play daddy, make moves with me 
I'da kept it more than real boo, can't lose with me 
Heard he smacked you ''cause you said my name while y'all was sexin' 
Ran up on this cat, thought was me, and started flexin' 
You know I ain't even with that 
So he gon' have to get that just on tv 
Try to creep me, what? Leave that nigga sleepy 
On the strength of you, that's your kid's daddy 
I ain't gon' send him on his way, put him up in that big caddy 
But let him know 
Never mind yo, I need you to go 
Take this snow up to 150, see Joe 
Get that, come back with that 
We can split that, sit back 
fuck, puff a L, forget that 
You wit dat?

Aiyyo this chicken got me digging her moves, ''cause she smooth 
Wanna lose, whoever she choose, it's the dues 
Respect is not expected but it's given ''cause it's real 
Being neglected and all, expect it, the deal 
Lie, cheat, and steal for me 
Putting something in a niggaz wig if you squeal for me 
Kill for me, you still with me 
''cause we get down like what 
Told you from the start, it ain't all about a nutt 
I'm gon' be fair, try to be there 
We gon' see then, hit me with the question boo 
That answer gon' be yeah 
See there, something can go wrong, it does 
Love'd it, Let it go 
but it came back, that's how strong it was 
But you belonged to 'cause, couldn't belong to me 
You had two kids by this nigga, it was wrong for me 
But we gon' always be, best of friends 
haha 
Mad love, Boo, to the end 
haha
