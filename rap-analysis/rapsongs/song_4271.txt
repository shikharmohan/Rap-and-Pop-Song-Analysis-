[Chorus:]
Before I Sleep I Pray To The Lord
A Soul To Keep
And If I Should Die
Before I Wake
I Pray To The Lord
My Soul To Take
For Goodness Sake
[Repeat]
Yeah I Wrote My Will Just The Other Week
And Whats Funny, It Was Only One Sheet
And I Know Theres Only One Me
But I Hope I Am Everything My Son Be
Im Trying To Live Right, Stay On That Drum Beat
But Im In The Fast Lane, In The Front Seat
I Wonder Will I Loose Control Of The Mazarati And Hit Some Tree Just Being Young Me
Is There A Heaven For G's And Soldiers? I Cant Go To Hell, Cause I'd Take Over
I Feel It Approaching, But I Aint Scared
I Made That Bed, And I Should Rest In Peace
[Chorus:]
Before I Sleep I Pray To The Lord
A Soul To Keep
And If I Should Die
Before I Wake
I Pray To The Lord
My Soul To Take
For Goodness Sake
[Repeat]
Yeah And Everytime I See The Sunshine
I Drop Down And Give Thanks At Least One Time
Feelin Like Im Living On The Front Line
Im Feelin Like Every Second Is Crunch Time
I've Had Breakfast, Will I Make It To Lunchtime?
And I Ain't Joking, So Dont Be Looking For Punchlines
Will I Be The Next Victim Of A Gun Crime
I Dont Know The Answer, Thats Why I Brung Mine
Riding By Myself Late At Night
Pistol On My Lap At Every Single Red Light
Yeah I Made My Bed Right, So When I Do I Should Sleep Tight
In Peace I Rest
[Chorus:]
Before I Sleep I Pray To The Lord
A Soul To Keep
And If I Should Die
Before I Wake
I Pray To The Lord
My Soul To Take
For Goodness Sake
[Repeat]
Bury Me A Gangster Cause That's What I Live
Don't Cry For Me I Gave The Best I Could Give
I Can Only Do Me, So That's What I Did
And I Cherish Every Breath Of My Kid
And I Don't Wanna Go Before She Grow, That Ain't Cool
But In This Game Of Life I Don't Make The Rules
Shit, So That's Why I Get Twisted
So I Can't Feel It When It Hits Me
And My Moms Don't Need That On Her
But I See Death Around The Corner
And If He, So Happens To Make His Way Around The Block
You Gotta Answer The Door When He Knock
Believe That
[Chorus: x2]
Before I Sleep I Pray To The Lord
A Soul To Keep
And If I Should Die
Before I Wake
I Pray To The Lord
My Soul To Take
For Goodness Sake
