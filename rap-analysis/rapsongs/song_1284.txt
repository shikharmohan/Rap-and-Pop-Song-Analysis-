Fuck all y'all, comin' of the wall
I got a nigga from The Source
Swingin' from my balls
Ya want me to set it
Well my MAC-11 takes unleaded
Let it rain and jackin' out fire
What you're seein' when I'm takin' shit another level higher
Now it's on ain't gettin' domed
Buckin' all these niggas 'til they all gone
Now we can roll to the east side of town
And I'm lookin' for a fat boy and a lotta state of clown
You better move your ass to this MAC-11
Pointed at your ass for the 1-8-7
Yeah motherfucker, gonna break your back with this shit
Hey motherfuckas move back,  yo, be real
Come back, come back yeah
I'm the head-hunter you goin' under
Make a trophy call it the two-headed buster
On my mantle back in the temple
Givin' up the family up and down Central
Butt bloody anybody lookin' for a wide body
One body, somebody
Some be testin'
Keepin' 'em guessin'
Smile on my face
Got the Smith & Wesson
Some be testin'
Keepin' 'em guessin'
Smile on my face
Got the Smith & Wesson
Some be testin'
Keepin' 'em guessin'
Smile on my face
Got the Smith & Wesson
Some be testin'
Keepin' 'em guessin'
Smile on my face
Got the Smith & Wesson
I ain't fallin' off like Humpty-Dumpty
Nigga you still wanna bump me
Still got the hand on the pump
And now I'm thumpin' on 'em, thumpin' on 'em, see
Somebody, anybody scream
When I got the gat with the big red beam
Now what if I moved it up right between your eyes
Now your chances are never
When you're lookin' at the slug at the of the barrel
Where ya gonna run when ya can't move further?
Seven eighty one redrum with the Murder
Tie him up, throw him in the trunk
Let the funk blow his eardrums out 'til he's bleedin'
Then let's get him weeded, it's the phunk Buddha
Let me do the ceremony up with the hoota and the shooter
Some be testin'
Keepin' 'em guessin'
Smile on my face
Got the Smith & Wesson
Some be testin'
Keepin' 'em guessin'
Smile on my face
Got the Smith & Wesson
Some be testin'
Keepin' 'em guessin'
Smile on my face
Got the Smith & Wesson
Some be testin'
Keepin' 'em guessin'
Smile on my face
Got the Smith & Wesson
