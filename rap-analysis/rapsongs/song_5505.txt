Yeah, yeah, yeah
All day baby, all day
I'ma flood the block block, with all that shit
I'ma flood the block block, with all that shit
I'ma flood the block block, with all that shit
I'ma flood the block block, with all that shit
You know my story, you can feel me, you know how I get done
I'm bout the money, I been at it for a little while never put the metal down
Hunger never satisfy, billion dollar snicker bar
And once I settle down, pre-nup to the lucky broad
A Bentley coupe, a bless in the backseat
First day, once they hand over them keys
Couple of g's, I'm trickin' on the watermelon trees
So high, so stuck, like Jay's Rucker team
On the bus no diss f'real stuck
Just countin' that, money and still visit my niggaz on the island
The money mountain I climb it, it won't stop
My money too dirty to ever go pop
It's a lot, you could do with a fifty [Incomprehensible] watch 0.40
Steadily, eliminate, competition and flood
That block with the Primo, 'cuz the Trunkilo
Not for too long, gotta stay on top of your people
I'ma flood the block block, with all that shit
I'ma flood the block block, with all that shit
I'ma flood the block block, with all that shit
I'ma flood the block block, with all that shit
I'ma flood the block block, with all that shit
I'ma flood the block block, with all that shit
I'ma flood the block block, with all that shit
I'ma flood the block block, with all that shit
It don't matter if it's the winter or summertime
I got the mac in my pants
Make niggards do that dance, they fuck with mines
It always come a time, when it's time to flip
You only flippin' when you hit by a gun of mines
You broke and you wanna shine, you in a dollar van
I'm in a  OH-5 G-55
That girl you with's a friend of mine, I hope that's not yo' wife
You wouldn't do that if you seen the bitch other side
We ain't got time for peasants, the streets need our presence
They not gettin' fed from them other guys
We in the hood like drugs, if we ain't out on tour
With Mobb Deep written on the headline
While y'all poppin' all that lip
We does what y'all talk and more of that kid
Unfold one of my knots, it look like a brick
We'll never go broke, while you sit and bitch
I'ma flood the block block, with all that shit
I'ma flood the block block, with all that shit
I'ma flood the block block, with all that shit
I'ma flood the block block, with all that shit
I'ma flood the block block, with all that shit
I'ma flood the block block, with all that shit
I'ma flood the block block, with all that shit
I'ma flood the block block, with all that shit
