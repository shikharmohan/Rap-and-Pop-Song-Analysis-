(Ay, who I be?)
Rubber band man wild as the Taliban
9 in my right 45 in my other hand
(Who I'm is?)
Call me trouble man always in trouble man
Worth a couple hundred grand chevys, all colors man
Rubber band man like a one man band
Treat these niggas like the Apollo and I'm the sandman
Tote a hundred grand Canon in the waistband
Looking for a sweet lick? Well this is the wrong place man
Seven time felon, what I care about a case man?
I'm campaigning to bury the hate, so say ya grace man
Ay, I don't talk behind a nigga back I say it in his face
I'm a thoroughbred nigga, I don't fake and I don't hate
Check my resume nigga my record's impeccable
Anywhere in the a nigga how TIP is highly respectable
And the MIA nigga I'm tryna keep it professional
'Cause all this tongue rastling finna have me snappin', I'm telling you
From the bottom of tha Duval, Cakalacky to New York
And everybody showing me love that's one to you all
Yeah, to all my Florida niggas, my Cakalacky niggas
My LA niggas
(Ay, who I be?)
Rubber band man wild as the Taliban
9 in my right 45 in my other hand
(Who I'm is?)
Call me trouble man always in trouble man
Worth a couple hundred grand chevys, all colors man
(Ay, who I be?)
Rubber band man wild as the Taliban
9 in my right 45 in my other hand
(Who I'm is?)
Call me trouble man always in trouble man
Worth a couple hundred grand chevys, all colors man
Call me trouble man stayed in some trouble man
Some niggas still hating on shawty so they some suckas man
Got a couple fans that love to do nothing other than
Lick, suck, show no respect but still I love 'em man
Dig it, Lil' Pimpin' got the mind and the muscle
Stay down on his grind put the crown on the hustle
Ay, I could show ya how to juggle anything and make it double
Weed, blow, real estate, liquor sto wit no trouble
Young cats is playin' today Marvin Gaye of my time
Tryna stay alive livin' how I say in my rhymes
My cousin used to tell me take this shit a day at a time
And told me Friday, died Sunday we a day in the ground
I still smile 'cuz somehow I know he seeing me now
And so I'm doing all my shows
