(devin and k.b. talking)
[devin]
I know I shouldn't do this
But I can't help it
I'm a fiend
Lotion and magazines is what I'm left wit
I step witout my pride
To the toilet
And laced my palm wit honey and almond
But suddenly the phone rings
And it's k.b.
Pussy just came through
Some for him and some for me
Hell yeah, I'll be there to help you fuck 'em
Get 'em drunk, get 'em high
Pull they titties out and suck 'em
[k.b.]
Don't rush 'em
We 'bout to fuck these hoes, man, no question
Just bring yo' ass on
Because they already buzzin'
And lovin'
My hospitality, I put it down
I got a quarter pound o' weed
And a big thing o' crown
Shit, my dick hard now
Just lookin' at these bitches
Wit these big soft asses and these nice round titties
While you gigglin'
You best to hurry yo' as the fuck up
I'm 'bout one second away
>from crackin' this fuckface up
[chorus]
No need for rest haven these hoes
Let's show 'em what they pussy made fo'
Let's me and you lay in these hoes
And show 'em what they pussy made fo'
No need for us savin' theses hoes
Let's show 'em what they pussy made fo'
Let's leave without payin' these hoes
And show 'em what they pussy made fo'
[devin]
Man, just let 'em know I'm comin' in 'bout 25 minutes
And get they pussy ready ''cause I'm finna dive in it
I hear 'em talkin' loud in the background, hollerin'
Tell 'em don't get too drunk and keep they pussy lips smilin'
[k.b.]
These hoes wildin'
But still I got 'em under control
Impatiently, waitin' for some dick that's swole
They just some horny ass bitches that love to fuck
Tellin' me how they suck dick and swallow the nut
(they gobble it up? )
I thought I told ya 'bout one of these hoes
That put my foot inside her pussy
Then took it out and sucked my toes
Yo, don't forget to stop and get some fuckin' dunk 'ems
(what? ) condoms, you forget dem nigga we got a problem
[devin}
That ain't no problem, man
You know we must cover our bones
Zoom zoom bust in the room
Get 'bout two and I'm gone
And as soon as I get there
I'm gonna spit some game to her
Get the pussy so quick
You think I already knew her
We 'bout to fuck these hoes
[chorus]
[k.b.]
Finally, at last, devin showed up
And the first thing this muthafucka said was
[devin]
What the fuck is this thick neck big bitch here
Man I shoulda bought a 16 ounce beer
Say big hoss you fucked over me dog
I thought we was cool
How in the hell we gonna get
These two big bitches in the pool
[k.b.]
(ha ha ha) you fool
Stop trippin' and just take ya clothes off
''cause all pussy feel the same when the lights go off
[devin]
Man that's too much ? ? 
For just one fuck
And I'll pass
You can't even tell the difference
'tween they stomach and they ass
Stretch marks on they titties like a road map
Hoe slapped on some maybeline
[k.b.]
But she keep her navel clean
And at least these hoes big and cute
Not big and fucked up
You den fucked a skinny, ugly ass hoe
So nigga what's up
Who give a fuck if you fuck these broads
Nobody knows
So just drank and smoke this dank
And let's fuck these hoes
[chorus]
Show 'em what they pussy made for (2x)
