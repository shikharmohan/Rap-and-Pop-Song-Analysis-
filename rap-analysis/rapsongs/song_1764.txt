Yo, just feeling the way that I do
Hope lives on, if not through me through song
I'm getting the long, take deep breaths and hold on
I write like I realize I could be gone
I'm here, is the true meaning of love clear?
If love is pain, is love really fair?
Is the meaning of life just to breed?
Is death losing all of your precious things?
Some think men don't cry, well, here's tears
Been told all these lives for these years
It's unclear why truth is untold
But hold fast and truth will unfold
I know but it's kinda hard to believe
That a whole generation will die over greed
And that most of our young will die overseas
But it all remains to go unseen
We are living for today not the past, trying to hold on
'Cause the trouble won't last
We are showing that the roots run deep
And the hope won't cease 'cause everyday we believe
We will, hold on and hold out, put it together
And make it work somehow
This is, this for Malcolm and music
My story, my movement, never forgetting the children
Keep your head to the sky
The only way that you fail is if you never ever try
Where I come from, I'm there for you, care for you
You don't have to worry I'm gonna always be there for you
Doing what, laying the foundation 'cause we gonna make it
But it's gonna take dedication
And what and hope and love and peace
I hope one day you'll see and then you can join us
Listen if you love me say the words to me
I'm surrounded by so many things that hurt to me
You know you'll always come first to me
This is music, it ain't nothing but a verse to me
Remember after the pain there's sunshine
It's not in vain we all feel it sometimes
Stay strong, hold on, we gonna make good
Every member [Incomprehensible]
We are living for today not the past, trying to hold on
'Cause the trouble won't last
We are showing that the roots run deep
And the hope won't cease 'cause everyday we believe
We will, hold on and hold out, put it together
And make it work somehow
This is, this for Malcolm and music
My story, my movement, never forgetting the children
This is for the mothers single handed
For all the ghettos way to dammit
Hey, the world, don't you panic
Let courage lead you right
Darkness is temporary
Even though the future's looking scary, yeah it is
The most I don't make mistakes
When your chosen us the light
I know we're a long way from home
On this land that they stole, took it all
Gave us drugs after gold
Incarceration to a fold
To raise the murder toll
What else, to divide communities
Do away with unity
Where the strength is human beings
We are living for today not the past, trying to hold on
'Cause the trouble won't last
We are showing that the roots run deep
And the hope won't cease 'cause everyday we believe
We will, hold on and hold out, put it together
And make it work somehow
This is, this for Malcolm and music
My story, my movement, never forgetting the children
We are living for today not the past, trying to hold on
'Cause the trouble won't last
We are showing that the roots run deep
And the hope won't cease 'cause everyday we believe
We will, hold on and hold out, put it together
And make it work somehow
This is, this for Malcolm and music
My story, my movement, never forgetting the children
