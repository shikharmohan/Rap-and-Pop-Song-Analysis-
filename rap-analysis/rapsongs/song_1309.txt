You know people just don't, people just don't see how much work
Is really involved in this rap shit, I didn't know it, I didn't see it
I never saw it until I was actually in it
You really gotta be in it to understand what it's like
But you always gotta, people always gotta see you smile
You always gotta put on that fake, you know what I'm sayin'?
Like no matter what you just been through
See it's gotta be right
So you wanna be a rap superstar and live large
A big house, 5 cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world, don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
I remember the days when I was a young kid growin' up
Lookin' in the mirror dreamin' about blowin' up
To rock crowds, make money, chill wit' the honeys
Sign autographs and whatever the people want from me
Shits funny, how impossible
Cream manifest in the games that be comin' with it
Never the less you gotta go for the gusto
But you don't know about the blood sweat and tears
And losin' some of your peers and losin' some of yourself
Music has past gone by
Hopefully you don't manifest for the wrong guy
Egomaniac in the brainiac, don't know how to act
Shits deep, 48 tracks, studio gangsta mack
Sign a deal, Emcees wanna make a mill
But never will till he crosses over still feelin' no hate
But fantasies come wit' these just to sacrifice the taste of makin' cheese
You wanna be a rap superstar in the biz
And take shit from people who don't know what it is
I wish it was all fun and games but the price of fame is high
And some can't pay to play, trapped in what you rappin' about
Tell me what happened when you lost clout
The rout you took started collapsing
No fans, no fame, no respect, no change
No women and everybody shits on your name
So you wanna be a rap superstar and live large
A big house, 5 cars, the rent charged
Comin' up in the world, don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
To be a rap superstar and live large
A big house, 5 cars the rent charged
Comin' up in the world, don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
When you sign to a record label
You don't know you sign your life over
And these white boys don't care about you
'Cuz the minute you fall off they'll find another Noreaga
And they'll find another Capone-N-Noreaga
And they'll find another B-Real
So you need to just keep
Stack your chips up
Do what you gotta do while your hot and motherfuckin' get out the game
Just do for the drug game is even worse because in a drug game
If somebody jerks you, you can shoot 'em and kill 'em
But in this game if somebody jerks you, you gotta be humble
No matter what you just been through, shit has gotta be right
You gotta approach people, you gotta be on the up and up
And everything's gotta be all good
When you see somebody slap hands with 'em
You know what I'm sayin' give 'em a pound or whatever it is
But you always gotta act like it ain't shit
So you wanna be a rap superstar and live large
A big house, 5 cars, the rent charged
Comin' up in the world, don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
To be a rap superstar and live large
A big house, 5 cars, the rent charged
Comin' up in the world, don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
My own son don't know me, I'm chillin' in a hotel room lonely
But I thank God I'm wit' my homies but sometimes
I wish I was back home but only no radio or videos
'Cause they show me no love
The phony gotta hit the road slowly
So the record gets pushed by Sony
I'm in the middle like monie and the press say that
My own people disowned me
And the best way back is to keep your head straight
Never inflate the cranium
Your crew worried about them honeys at the palladium
Who just wanna cling on swing on and so on and go on and fall off
The hoes fall off to the next rap superstar
Wit' no shame give him a year and they'll be right out the game
The same as the last one who came before him
Gained fame started gettin' ignored
I warned him, assured him this ain't easy take it from Weezy
Sleazy people wanna be cheesy, they talkin' evil
So you wanna be a rap superstar and live large
A big house, 5 cars, the rent charged
Comin' up in the world, don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
Assassin
Assassin
To be a rap superstar and live large
A big house, 5 cars, the rent charged
Comin' up in the world, don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
