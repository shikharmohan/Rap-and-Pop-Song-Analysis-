Yeah,
This is ladies night once again it's on
Your man actin up then leave him home
It's the girls the industries call the rap Madonna
More dangerous than a tank full of Piranah's
Corvosier in my left arm glass in my other hand
While I pop that coochie like a rubber band
I'm feelin sexy in my million doller biggie bra
ey yo BeyoncÃÃÂ©, how you feelin ma?
[BeyoncÃÃÂ©]
I'm feelin sexy
I wanna hear ya say my name, boy
If you can reach me
You can feel my burnin' flame
Feelin kinda n-a-s-t-y, 
Boy I just wan' take you home with me
Baby
The minute I feel your energy
The vibe is just takin over
I start feelin so crazy, baby
Lately, I feel a funk comin over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm got me feelin so crazy
Babe

The way your body
Moves across the floor boy
Baby

The rhythm got me feelin so crazy
