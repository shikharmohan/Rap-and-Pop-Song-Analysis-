When you look into the mirror in the morning do you recognize who you see
When I look into the mirror in the morning I don't see anything
What happens when the sun don't rise and the birdies don't wana sing
And even the flowers of the day die and then they stink 
and then they shrink
And even the friend of mine says the shrink might work 
and I was thinking bout clearing my mind but im afraid it might hurt
And just when it seem that I got the hole world at my door
The bell ring and I open up with a bang
Im ready for the world im ready for you girl
Im ready for the world im ready for you girl
Im ready for whatever for now and forever
Im ready for whatever for now and forever
Im ready for the worlld the the the world
Im ready for the worlld the the the world
Way til they gget a load of me
Sicotic my pilot left the air craft
Good weed like im smoking on some tear gas

Pissed off no more like shittin on

Opening

Is you ready 4 5 and the the leather coat and shoot these mother fuckers and whoever cope
Somebody better let em know I ended the banana clip in and in your cantaloupe
Fruity niggers suck a dick fuck the wrodl id rather fuck a bitch
Starin at the walls of the room figurin  out how to get out 
And theres no window to escape your mental drought
You think about the crossroads than the man that's conducting the train 
And then you lift your protected you still cant fuck lil wayne
