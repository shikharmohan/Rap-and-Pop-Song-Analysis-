Get down with the party

I'm the Big Kahuna maneuvers I make 'em
Tight security everywhere I go I take 'em
Party over here me and my peeps
(Rah, rah)
Hittin' the streets groovin' to roughneck beats
I keeps the flow I'm the dawn breaker
I'm reachin' all night, as hot as daylight in Jamaica
A ruckus you want it? Get with the Show stopper
I'll dig ya like the mud number one chief rocker
But knock a blast for your ass like boom
Damn, Salt-N-Pepa stepped in the room
With the La-Di-Da-Di, we like to party
We don't cause trouble, we don't bother nobody
Get down with the party
(Wanna hang)

(Ah)

When it come to scandalous I'm numero uno
Shakin', the record breakin', the title taken
Hot, cool and vicious, delicious, Jamaican
Big Willie, illy-silly rabbit
You need the ha, ha, you gotta have it, a habit
I'll be the good time dealer
The happy go lucky lucker, keepin' it real
Got the whole shebang, champagne is bubbly
Moneymakers lookin' and I like 'em black and ugly
Trust me, we be the life of the jam
Front like you don't know, you know who we am
Get down with the party
(Wanna hang)
I'm the Big Kahuna I got the whole shebang
I got the champagne and the ha, ha
(Ah)
You know who we are

Put 'em up, reach, put 'em up reach
Now where's all the money at? Where you at? Where you at?
Put 'em up, reach, put 'em up reach

Put 'em up, reach, put 'em up reach

Some people say I'm "Lucky" but I don't give a
No stress, blessed, I gets down for mine

Well, it's party time
No line, V.I.P., I'm the one you wanna see

The Cartier got you fiendin', stop scheming
Before the red dots starting beaming
Go, Don Peri one flow, got my playgirls, yo

Shake it with the hearty
Your body look damn good, never did it with a hood
Get down with the party
(Wanna hang)
