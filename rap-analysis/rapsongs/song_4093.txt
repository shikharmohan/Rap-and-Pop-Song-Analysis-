I Wake Up In The Morning Take A Knee And Thank God,
Then Go To The Mirror Look Myself In The Eyes
Today I Didn't Wake Up With A Woman On My Side,
Yesterday, I Didn't Wake Up With A Woman On My Side
Neither The Days Before That Nor Before That
I Just Remembered The Moments, Call Me Kodak
In All That I Do Miss You But its your denial
That I Must Hold Against You
Since You Been Gone I Have Been All Alone
But Alone Is Steriod 'cause It Makes Me Strong.
Girl, Her Gone In The Wind,
You Cheated On Godson Baby Girl That's A Sin
But I Forgive You, But I Can't Give You
Another Chance Ma, You Are In My Rearview
And I Put That Ring On Your Finger, I Was All In
But Now It's Just A Symbol Of What Could Have Been
Goddamn; I Know Am By Myself, But
Damn, She Left Me All By Myself, But
Yo!
I Love My Niggaz, No Homo
I Swear I Hope They All Get Cheese Like D'journo
It's Something About The Hot Boyz That You Don't Know
I Got A Lot Of Love For Them That I Don't Show
And B.G. Been My N**** Since The Front Door
I Hope Choppa City Records Blow.. Fa Sho
And Me And Juve Never Really Got Along
But You Still Would Let Your N***A Come Get On Your Hottest Song
Damn I F**k With You For That
I F**k With You Lil One
And Me And Skip Go Back
And When You See A Really Nigga
You Got Tip Your Hat
And Since Am A Real Nigga
So I Do Just That
I Had My Own Lawyer Workin' On Turk's Case
After I Heard Him Dissin Me On The Mixtape
'cause He's Locked Up And I'm Free
He Got A Lot More To Worry About Than Me
I Aint Tripping
