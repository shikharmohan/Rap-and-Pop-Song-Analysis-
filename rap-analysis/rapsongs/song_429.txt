Nigga thug all day any day
Even when I'm in L.A. I run with the Thugs
Better creep to the city and look for the weed spot
Stop 'cause I gotta get bud
Wanna get a pound of that fool stuff
Some of that smoke and puff
And if you smoke enough
You sure enough get P.O.D.'ed
Cleveland, it's the same thang
They out there puff M. Jane
Inhale, exhale back on the plane
Headed to the city that's sunny all year 'round
That's right Miami, it's like a little planet
Full of sin but we got to have it
And I'm simply tryin' to tell these motherfuckers
That we thug all day, babe we thug always
So come to the party and bring somebody
And bring some weed and a tank of Bacardi
It's gon' get rowdy

Stayin' true to the game 'cause that's all I know
I'm a street nigga, keep the heat nigga
Gettin' street figures, all night long
I gots to go get me some money
'Cause just like that nigga gots to have it
It be greens as spinach or cabbage, whatever you call it
You do your math and work this magic
Get on the grind, in position to be the boss
Niggaz can floss and talk but I know they soft
But a nigga like me stay raw on the D.L.
'Cause what we sell ain't none of nobody's business
Never was and nigga never will be
Thinkin' I'm broke but I'm out here filthy, feelin' me?
Y'all niggaz be killin' me
Braggin' 'bout the money that you claim you makin'
Fuck around, catch you down there sleepin'
Then that money be up for the takin', yeah

Go against us, you ain't goin' nowhere
Bone Thugs-N-Harmony keepin' it real for St. Clair
Anybody that want it, even if it's on my mornings

You know, we like the echo and oh
You know we like to roll the Indo
You know we like the Benz-O with O
He don't even know, he the enemy for sho'
With a .44 out of the holster bust on him
Like real niggaz supposed ta
Sticky-icky blowin' brew in my leather sofa
Little nigga, rollin' spiritual soldier
Like Nat Turner, clap burner, murda mo murda
Murder motherfucker, shit is hot as the kitchen furnace
From smokers to workers, Cleveland to Cali
Ghetto in those suburbias, little Bizzy stay pimpin' alley
And finally the vinyl be vital in washed up and, I already got the title
Besides my vibe is the shit, it's too many styles
