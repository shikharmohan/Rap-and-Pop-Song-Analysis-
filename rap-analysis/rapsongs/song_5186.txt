[Meth] 
Traces of lipstick on my collar 
Baby you got to do some more to get this last dollar 
Hotter than lava when you come believe that I'ma follow 
Lady Medana like the drink-machine I like to swallow 
Rockin' that Prada, Honey stay up in the beauty parlor, 
Girl it would be my honour, make you my babymomma 
Holler she hella proper, fuck with tha dumbin' cousin 
Sucka for lovin'-buggin', shockin' them duckin' buckin' 
Suckin' then finga-fuckin', then let me say you somethin' 
I'm not to stuffin' of that English muffin 
Can't tell me nuthin', uhn uhn 
Pushin' yo' ? in when I'm stuckin' 
All of a sudden, baby gun-duckin', BBC! Oh girl you nasty 
[Redman] 
Yo' I get it on poppin' 
Doc, unlockin' yo' doors, clockin' my drawers 
Suckin' your mouth with a torn stockin' 
Rapped around ? , I'm creepin' when you parkin' 
Shoot out the lights, darkening the erea, then hop in 
Pick up my bigga nigga who helped me figured the plottin' 
Droppin' the tops, splittin' the dough 
Shoppin' in rotten--New York, first flockin' 
Because I'm heavy like Bo stockin' coat 
Watch ya coat from Fo sparkin', they leave the parking 
Niggaz unforgetable can be forgotten 
Doc and Meth ? the top ten! 
Choppin' it raw, lockin' 'n blockin', 
Only raw choppin' his metaphores, so cops can stop watchin' 
I put 'em in and cock 'em, ready to rock 'em stock 'em 
Renevate your appartment, when these two things barkin' 
My Mackamichi knockin', bougie holes be spottin' on they trampers 
I get 'em dripple like Lickey Falses 
[Chorus]: Redman, [Meth] 
Now who a bitch nigga?! 
[Now who a snitch nigga?!] 
Now who the shit nigga?! 
[Now who the sick nigga?!] 
Now who you with nigga?! 
[With who you with nigga?!] 
Who rock shit nigga?! 
[Who pop shit nigga?!] 
[Come on!] Come on! [Come on!] Come on! 
[Come on!] Come on! [Come on!] Come on! 
[Come on!] Come on! [Come on!] Come on! 
[Come on!] Come on! [Come on!] Come on! 
[Redman] 
I figured it out: ya'll niggaz ain't as big as yo' mouth 
My street-value well it ain't won't even fit in yo' couch 
When I bust titties come out 
No matter what city hardcore committee's dumb to fuck out 
Son's ya duck out! Nuthin' to lose, poppin' a two up in ya goose 
Buckle yo shoes, cuffle my boots, fuckin' with you 
Blow my Anaconda like Nirvana 
Marijuana got bitches on they knees in they Gabbanas 
Gettin' 'em dirty dirty with the hersey and the bombin' 
Holla the drama, fire two in ya armor 
Ya pigeon betta call ma, the ice is a honour 
To in help me lift an arm up, lebaba(?) with ya momma 
Even dirty her donna, my dick is heronomic 
Pull out a young Geroni-mo, BBC! Oh girl you nasty 
[Meth] 
Itchin' to start the mission, flippin' so keep yo' distance 
Ain't go no pot to piss in? Ain't got no competition 
Listen, I slip the clippin', trippin' you get me lippin' 
Come mis and catch a whippin', now kids is actin' different 
Ditchin' them double-dippin', chickens that keep forgettin' 
I ain't the one for trickin', or anybody-kickin' 
Rippin' these compesitions, scrippin' them paper-written 
Hold 'em and hit 'n stickin', ballin' like Scottie Pippen 
It's hot in Hell's Kitchen, but still I'm forced bittin' 
Shittin' like 'No he didn't', wipin' my ass and splittin' 
Chattin' like Joe gettin' 
All in the zone settin' it off like Big Daddy 
It ain't no half-steppin'...I keep rappin' 
Staten you keep sweatin', frontin' and ass-bettin' 
Duckin' my Smith & ? , trashin' the Meth and catchin' 
Hell, we leave you restin' in PEACE, BBC! Oh girl you nasty 
[Chorus]
