(Gamin' on ya)
Mmm, he's gamin' on ya, girl
So look out now
(Gamin' on ya)
Ooh, whee, here he comes, here he comes
Once upon a time called now is where it all begins, you see
As the plot thickens and your heartbeat quickens
My sister, my sister, look out, here comes the big-big gabber
And he's badder than the Mad Hatter
Sellin' dreams, climbin' Jacob's ladder
Your life he'll shatter 'cause it don't matter to him
He's out to get some [unverified], can't let him in or you'll get done in
So stop, don't let him run up on ya 'cause all he wants to do is bone ya
He's gamin' on ya, oh yeah, he's gamin' on ya girl
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Gamin' on ya)
Can't ya see? Can't ya see?
He's gamin' on ya, and he's playin' games
He's gamin' on ya, oh, when ya know
Ow, ow, gamin' on ya
Well, first you get dissed and treated like a slut
Treats ya like shit when he won't see the butt
Your boots are juicin', ooh, guess what?
He's gamin' on ya
(Word up, so)
How in the hell do you let yourself go and get played again?
You know he wants the skins or calling you honey
When he needs something
(Word)
It ain't funny
(nope)
Me, I don't trust nothing, see
He's gamin' on ya
(Yeah, yeah)
He's gamin' on ya
(Yeah, yeah)
Gamin' on ya
(Yeah, yeah)
Gamin' on ya
Listen to the big, big, big Pep
(Yeah, yeah)
Young and dumb and tryin' to get over
Swift with the tongue and bubbly like soda
So play like you don't know
And you won't go out like underarm odor
You need to get a grip and think about the shit you're doin'
Or it won't be too long before your reputation's ruined
Look at you now, you're being taken and don't have a clue
There's a sucker born every minute, right? True
So check out how it's goin' down
Slippin' and dippin' you all around
He's gamin' on ya
He's gamin' on ya
Gamin' on ya
(Can't you see?)
Gamin' on ya
He's gamin' on ya
(So how ya know?)
Gamin' on ya
Gamin' on ya
Gamin' on ya
(Baby, baby, baby, please)
Don't let him tell ya off or sell ya off
You're better off without him
Don't give a damn about him
Ain't nothin' dope about him
He's gamin' on ya
(Yeah yeah)
Gamin' on ya
(Yeah yeah)
He's gamin' on ya
(Yeah yeah)
Gamin' on ya
(Yeah yeah)
