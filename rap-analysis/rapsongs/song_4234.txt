I don't know bout you
But umm...
[Chorus: x2]
My girlfriend, got a girlfriend
My girlfriend, got a girl and we do do do do do do do do
What we do do do do do do do do
What we do
[Verse 1:]
You know me, young F hoe
I gets all in her mouth like strep throat
I gets all in her belly like pepto
Straight stompin' in dat pussy like a stepshow
Ghetto bitches keep me with em like lip glow
College bitches keep me with em like cliffnotes
Cold bitches keep me with em like thick coats
Two foreign bitches, now that's a mink show
Pull your skirt up, and let ya hips show
She fell in love with a stripper at the strip show
And now... there's
Two bitches and me [x3]
[Chorus: x3]
[Verse 2:]
I like long hair, I hate make up
Fuck my pillows up, fuck is really up
I like slim chicks, I love big broads
All the bitches love me, I need a dick guard
And if she don't give head, shes a nimrod
Bitch I would never put your number on my sim card
I look at M J G and 8 ball as mentors
And shit... all they ever told me was pimp hard
Pimp harder, I get head and tail like a quarter
Yup, yup, in dat order
Two bitches and me [x2]
[Chorus: x2]
[Verse 3:]
Two bitches and me [x4]
And...
They kissin and huggin [x4]
Hello
I could play with it, I could beat it up
Yup, beat it up, get ya pussy lip bust
Wait
She said she wanna know how pussy taste
She wanna xxxx dick while she get her pussy ate
Ha
Movies, massage, menage, bedroom, bathroom, garage, goodbye
Just leave me be, and it was just us three, two bitches and me
[Chorus: x2]
