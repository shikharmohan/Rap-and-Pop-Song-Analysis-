yeah whats the deal ya'll this missy elliott givin ya'll magazine writer's 
radio cats listers or plain old haters a small piece of my album which is 
titled under construction under consrtuction simply states that im a work in 
progress im working on myself you know uh every since Aaliyah passed i view 
life in a uh more valuable way looking at hate and anger gossip or just plain 
ol bullshit became ignorant to me when you realize in a blink of a eye you 
walking down a church aisle and that was meant for weddings and happiness and 
realize the same church aisle are used to view a loved one for the last time 
from the world trade families the left eye family big pun family you know 
biggie family pac family to the hip hop family we all under construction trying 
to rebuild you know ourselves hip hop done gained respect from you know not 
even respect form but just like rock and roll and it took us a lot of hard work 
to get here so all that hatin and animosity between folks you need to kill it 
with a skillet you don't see bill gates and donald trump arguing wit each other 
'cause both of them got paper and the they got better shit to do get more paper so 
all im sayin is lets take hip hop back to the rope follow me
