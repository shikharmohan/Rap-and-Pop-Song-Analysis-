Out in Jamaica the ladies callin me back. Mark mine from long time dey be callin me dat. I'm good in the Bahamas as a matter of fact I sell that often in my yacht from Miami and back. Man I got folks who be trappin way in Marie and Pupat. Get blow so cheap in Columbia the problem getting it back. Then I got homies in Cuba they be deliverin crack. They bring it to your front door steps jus charge a luxury tax. Never mind the chances they taken no they think nothin of that. They figure either they make it or customers sellin em back. No Ethiopia crooks who don't play by the books. They soft-spoken as they may be no they aint sweet as the look. Man I got folks in Brazil to them it aint nothin to kill. They get locked up "no habla ingles" they say nothin for real. Eses in Mexico City live right outside of the city tell 'em I got up to 50 jus know they comin to getcha.

We live on money like we get the money right. Grip the yae and bang bang and try to maintain that's why we slang that kane. Bass pipes, late night on a hike high beams headlights. Coast to coast. I'm so connected. I'm in the suites on the streets hit records. Brick layers. Construction workers. Pancakes, Ziplocs, hamburgers. Daynen Danes, mustard and mayonnaise. I'm livin the life that n**** that lie that n**** that mayo paste. Translation. A lot of paper. Ya hear my voice daily don't you baby daily.
