I can't, I won't, I can't
I won't let you leave
I don't know what you want
You want more from me
She said to him, "I want you to be a father
He's your little boy and you don't even bother
Like 'Brother' without the R and he's starting to harbor
Cool and food for thought but for you he's a starver"
"Starting to use red markers on his work
His teacher say they know he's much smarter but he's hurt
Used to hand his homework in first
Like he was the classroom starter"
"Burst to tears, let them know she see us
Now he's fighting in class
Got a note last week that say he might not pass
Ask me if his daddy was sick of us
'Cause you ain't never pick him up"
"You see what his problem is
He don't know where his poppa is
No positive male role model
To play football and build railroad models"
"He's making a hole, you've been digging it
'Cause you ain't been kicking it
Since he was old enough to hold bottles
Wasn't supposed to get introduced to that
He don't deserve to get used to that"
"Now I ain't asking you for money or to come back to me
Some days it ain't sunny but it ain't so hard
Just breaks my heart, when I try to provide
And he say, 'Mommy, that ain't your job'"
To be a man, I try to make him understand
That I'm his number one fan
But it's like he born from the stands
You know the world is out to get him
So why don't you give him a chance?"
I can't, I won't, I can't
I won't let you leave
Now, now, I don't know what you want
You want more from me
