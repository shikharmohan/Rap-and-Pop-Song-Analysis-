[Drake] 
My name is drizzy 
and i aint perfect 
but i work hard 
so i deserve it 
and i belong 
right where you see me 
aint on offence about it 
i aint mistah Feeny 
nah, i got a decent set of manners 
and a job that fills up any empty schedule or planner 
and i fall in love with girls caught up in superficial glamor 
who dress like sarah jessica 
and live like princess diana 
so often they have addictions 
and im the one that'll feed it 
but truely you're bad enough that you dont even really need it 
you can show up at the party on dirty public transit 
and i guarantee the cameraman would still be snappin candids 
of you and your posse partying 
drinking watch you get handed 
with your virgin island tans 
all lookin like you just landed 
i dont really understand it 
im not sure im comprehending it 
but these girls are having fun with whoevas money they spendin 
Chorus x2 
I got to be Unstoppable 
I got to be Unstoppable 
Ey ey ey ey 
You don't lie 
Ey ey ey ey 
You don't lie

My name is weezy 
Im almost perfect 
and i work harder than hard workin

and my doormat is always sandy 
and i run louisiana 
but ive never pulled a hammy 
and i got a condo in atlanta 
and i always wear a bandany 
and when it comes down to stuntin

[Santogold] 
I got the talk 
The beats and bass 
Give me one I'll take it 
Make you lose your place, 
Tell me I-I-I can play 
So I speed up the pace 
I break it break it you can't stop me 
In this ra-race 
Chorus x2 
I got to be Unstoppable
