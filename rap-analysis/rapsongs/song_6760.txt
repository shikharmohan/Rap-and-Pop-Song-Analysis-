Mr. Snoop D O double G and he brings to the tank
Money, power, respect, leadership
Street knowledge and wisdom

Pop the Champagne

So pay attention and listen

Welcome to this world that you never thought existed
And you got to be a soldier to be enlisted
Listen, I'm gonna take your mind and your body and your soul
On a whole li'l trip, just don't lose your grip
Wait a second, where is the sack?
You don't have to ask no questions just jump in the back
And leave your strap, 'cuz there ain't none of that
Where we goin'? It ain't nuthin' but 808, beats and flauntin'
Niggas showin' niggas love, hoes suckin' dicks
That's how we do it, 'cuz everything is in the mix
Doggy Land, Doggy World, Snoop World whatever
It don't matter 'cuz we 'bout it and homies down to do whatever
Everything is legit, and the bitches the shit
And niggas they give you love 'cuz dey down for it
Now that's just how it goes and all the hoes on me
And everything is V.I.P and that's on D.P.G.
Now nigga creep in, just like a liquor store
So nigga if you want a hoe, nigga just let me know

Welcome to my world
Wipe your feet before you enter in
Now take a seat and peep dis beat and sip yo' gin
'Cuz ain't no killin', everybody chillin'
Steady stackin' paper from the floor up to the ceilin'
Now in my world, a bitch is a girl
And man's best friend is his ends and his mothafuckin' Benz
But y'll can't get in just 'cuz you all say you chall down wit us
And try to get around wit us and hang around wit us and clown wit us
Hold on, this shit here is for the establishment
Niggas that's havin' shit and if you ain't roll on and stroll on
This is the spot were the bangers at, the slangers at
Where red and blue equals green and we proud to be black
In fact we stack G's for them keys, so when we finished doin' deeds
You all can't believe what we did
Provide an opportunity in the community
Tryin' to spread a li'l unity between you and me
Since I'm the mayor, I think I gotta say a li'l somethin'
Let's keep it jumpin' playa, playa
Ain't too many places that you know about
So everybody in the world, welcome to the muthafuckin' Dogg house
Welcome to my world nigga where it's V.I.P
And the bitches and the Bud for free
Welcome to my world nigga where it's V.I.P
And the bitches and the Bud for free
Ugh, picture me ballin'
3rd world hustler out the ghetto of New Orleans
Some say life is like a fairy tail
Did a song with Snoop Dogg and it turned into a business deal
But it ain't 'bout da ends 'cuz we all got matches and we all got Benz's
It's about riddin' with the homies
Gettin' rid of the fake and lookin' through the phonies
And the haters can't stop this, check Billboards, number one
The only company with a profit
So say, ugh and how you do dat there
It's no limit, D.P.G.
Nigga we don't care
Welcome to my world nigga where it's V.I.P
And the bitches and the Bud for free, come on
