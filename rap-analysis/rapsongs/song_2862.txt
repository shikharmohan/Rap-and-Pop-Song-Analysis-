Her face glow like I was exposed to sunlight
She's happy, her hair, toes and nails is dumb right
The smell of her fragrance, baffled my nostrils
I can see through her eyes, she's feeding on in the possible
She blushes as I kept splashing her compliments
Polite thank yous is all around she crush the mints
Developments, smooth keys from the piano
Changed the mood like we changed the channel
This is art Picasso I got him beat in the flesh
I'm staring at beauty Nefertiti heaven bone in the chest
Yes, everywhere she step went off like a flare gun
Stilettos on parquet floors
Miss thing, she's a fierce one, two and three
Bad little mama she built like Alicia Keys
No facade, her strut is hard, based on books by
Intelligent jail crooks writing to let the time fly
She dropped the bracelet, I kneeled down
Prestigious gentleman, with my right hand I picked it up
I stood up, to the cutest eyelashes as I gave her her jewels back
Miss thing started rubbing her gut
Excuse me are you pregnant? Not to be rude
But if it means anything I can get you some food
Cheese crackers, in the back there's sauteed shrimp
Nah, I never free lumps, I'll be as big as a blimp
See my due date is January my first and it's kinda scary
It's only June, in Christmas I'll be getting married
And I'm happy, excuse me, what's your name?
Tone Starks, peace, I'm Gabby
Well, I gotta go my husband is waiting
But before I go can I give you one last statement
You the most beautifullest queen I ever seen
And I would love to have a thing like you on my team, you take care
Any other day I would of just let you, pass me by
'Cause I see you got situations and I've got mine
But baby it's okay, it's alright, I'm not gonna let you pass me by
'Cause this was love at first sight
'Cause this was love at first sight, it's okay
You can tell he must be on a mission
Because my heart has made it's decision
As soon as you stepped in my peripheral vision
I fell in love, sweet love
And no infatuated 3D glasses to see
That you're the one I need
And the situation don't matter to me
'Cause this is love, it gotta be love, love at first sight
Any other day I would of just let you, pass me by
'Cause I see you got situations and I've got mine
But baby it's okay, it's alright, I'm not gonna let you pass me by
'Cause this was love at first sight
'Cause this was love at first sight, it's okay
Any other day I would of just let you, pass me by
'Cause I see you got situations and I've got mine
But baby it's okay, it's alright, I'm not gonna let you pass me by
'Cause this was love at first sight
'Cause this was love at first sight, it's okay
