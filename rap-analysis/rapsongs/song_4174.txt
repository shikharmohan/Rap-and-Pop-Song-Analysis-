Young money, young, young, young, young money, young mula baby
[Chourus]
And I can smell her looking at I
She recognize real I dont wear no disguise
And I can see it in her eyes
She fucking me wit her eyes
She fucking me wit her eyes
She fucking me wit her eyes
She fucking me wit her eyes, yeah.
[Lil Wayne]
Gazing out the window of somethin foreign
Thinking to myself-self, self
How come getting money neva gets boring
How come getting money neva gets boring
Baby I got a stack now whatcha gon do for it
Can you bring it back like a muthafuckin chorus
Shawty I got a stack now whatcha gone do for it
Can you bring it back like a muthafuckin chorus
Girl I am hotter than poppa bears porridge
Baby can I put ma private parts in ya storage

[Kidd Kidd]
Her chanel frames are like X-rays
She see us out the club and into the bed
She picture me in her head and her givin' head
Handcuffs and whips ima sex slave
No wraps on ma back, rah, whatcha name?
I yell kunta rah kunta kinte
With one foot off i still try to escape but who can I run to like escape
I guess I got some attention to pay
The girl blazin like a doughnut on a early sunday
And I could be the chocolate on top of her sundae
She lookin at me like a fat bitch infront of entree
[Chourus]
[Mack Mane]
You see she wreckless eye baller feelin a nigga swagga
If looks was fuckin no telling how many kids we done had
Got me feelin like Missy, cause she all in my grill
And be face off the peel time to give her that whip a peel
Betcha I can get her home, 4 shots of patron
And then I know its on tell my niggas look im gone
Ma you grown so dont worry bout your girls tryna criticize
One night with Mack & babygirl you'll be dick-notized
Fatten up your hips and thighs
Help that ass bout out
And on the next song tell her give ma dick a shout out
See she could be ma sockee
And I could be her plug
Or she could be ma fiend and I could be her drug
No disguise
[Chorus]
[Nicki Minaj]
All i do is ice grill em
Then he get hard again
He know my pussy stay warmer than a cardigan
Slippery, slimey, excuse me dont mind me
Say its too fat for me to be this tiny
Im sucha mainiac, lemme get some brainiac
You know that special head, like Im in special ed
Got me givin you these nasty looks
Stick me up with the uh, thats the nasty jooks
Now, i get him rocker than a caveman

The Mistress
