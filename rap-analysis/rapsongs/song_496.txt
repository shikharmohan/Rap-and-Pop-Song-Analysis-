YEAA 
Better back up off me/ nigga never no softY/ boy I'll stop your heartbeat
While you out in the street yellin out what you fittin to do to me/ in the middle of your speech ima sweep you off your feet, to sleep 
Fuckin with these thugs/ thinkin ya'll don't bleed blood
Ima make you a believa pop pop, what you receiva/ A mothafuckin bullet from my automatic pistol, hit you him too, and all the rest of them niggas that you got wit ya
I'm collected and quiet/ but surpise nigga i get LIVE
jumpin out of that BUCKET dumpIN/ fittin to show these niggas a little somethin
Reppin shit for bone thugs, nigga don't test mine to the redline/ but like my MO Thug niggas they BOSS show EM THE GUNLINE, GUNLINE
Caught in the line of fire boy if you want to/ and a nigga gon be on your ass like skunk's funk pew
I grab my dick let my nuts swang from my thang/ if you's a anybody killa nigga, let the bullets rain
DONT BE PULLIN MY STRINGS cause if you ain't you don got into some shit/ with the thuggish, ruggish bloody murda click

Undercover man, how you want it man/ Ima fool on the loose with a gun in hand 
I got a sure shot aim for the runnin man/ that'll stop you in the tracks when I'm dumpin man, they did somethin man
Niggas talk real loud words fly out they mouth when you ain't around/ talkin like a nigga stole they style BUT when a nigga show up these niggas bow down
Pound for pound from the shoulders nigga I'm the coldest little soldier/ BIG NIGGAS OR IF ITS A CLIQUE OF you niggas believe i got somethin for ya, in the holsta
In the bushes cocked, up on the porch i got a gauge and glock/ corner to corner this thing on lock yea it's hot on this block
Nigga got everything short a cannons wild n out but i ain't Nick Cannon/ nigga got M-11s SR-15s and i plan to let niggas have it 
Fuck this rappin, if it come down to it nigga disrespectin what's happnin/ my family my money my thugs myself my nigga i'm flat out blastin
Countin out caskets on you bastards smashin if I'm ever forced to bring the action/ ima ride down i'm pistol packin we can definetly get it crackin 
Old fashioned like the wild west Ghetto Cowboy nigga 06/ fake niggas and real niggas in the real world just don't mix 
-chorus- 
-Wish- 
I'm a hundred proof, want a taste?/ take it to the head or the face wrong place you can do it
Never met a sucka nigga runnin with a thugga, not in the game/ nigga runnin with a thuggish ruggish in my range
Better do my damn thing and lift ya mayne/ BET YOU won't leave the same way you came 
We soldiers tight put up your stripes we'll rip them off slash somebody back with a attitude that right/ I'm sick with the money spent on bullet proof nigga fight fight
Handle that, nigga handle that give back to the music fuck that fuck that/ reach back throw back everybody in the car gotta lean back
See now the game was soft so we back/ hit em in the head with a relapse
Younger than most of you niggas so what? you die you die if i decide/ then we ride 
If it's on you rock a bye bye/ thuggstas straight up warned you will, obey mine 
Oh we will ride yes we ride in the nightime/ it really don't matter get high up in the daylight 
Thuggstas no fools we know the rules/ don't get too close with the attitude, do, cause ooo won't like how i give it to ya
