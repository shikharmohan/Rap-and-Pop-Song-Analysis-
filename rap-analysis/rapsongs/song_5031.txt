Look up in the sky
Look up in the sky
Look up in the sky
You thought I was down
You thought I was gone
Thought I wasn't around
That I left you alone
Well, look up in the sky
Just look up in the sky
See that I'm everywhere, everywhere
Shining down on you
Well, well, is that our little author?
Coming back, humming his hymns a little altered
Your attention put back on the flow like the department of water
Taken off of the dough like Little Walter, Chess
Yes, baby I'm Jerry Lawler
Rebel with a cause, outlaw with a lawyer
Judge, jury like Alou, rap name Lupe
But my daddy named me warrior, this is his memorial
You thought I was down
You thought I was gone
Thought I wasn't around
That I left you alone
Well, look up in the sky
Just look up in the sky
See that I'm everywhere, everywhere
Shining down on you
No, I ain't the nigga trying to get a liquor line
When I be scrippin' lines, want this petition sign
It says I'm sick of dyin', sick of this prison time
I really love my people, I'm sick of pimpin' mine
Now, if we Auto-Tune that shit
We can hear the songs from that opera-groomed fat bitch
Tellin' us not to pursue it, just to shoo it like a blacksmith
We're trapped, and movin' round in circles like it's Chapstick
And that's the same encircled way of thinking that we chat with
Well, wrap this around your head like the bandanas
Fabolous used to wrap his hats with, rather be in feds
Instead of National Geographics, well I'm not havin' it, no
You thought I was down
You thought I was gone
Thought I wasn't around
That I left you alone
Well, look up in the sky
Just look up in the sky
See that I'm everywhere, everywhere
Shining down on you
So I say hello and this is for the third time
To everybody out there who ain't never heard mine
And if you have then you know you ain't ever heard lyin'
Lu don't moo, no cowards, you only heard lines
Not a facade cherisher, I'd rather have the scars
I don't idolize America, I'm dancing with the stars
Uh huh, all of them, yeah they are too
You look up and you see us shining down on you
You thought I was down
You thought I was gone
Thought I wasn't around
That I left you alone
Well, look up in the sky
Just look up in the sky
See that I'm everywhere, everywhere
Shining down on you
