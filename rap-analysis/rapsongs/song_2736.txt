Niggaz busting caps on a Sunday
I'm riding through the park with my white six bloody
Thinking to myself, what the fuck is this?
I grab my motherfuckin' shit, load the clip and then I get
The extra hallow points out the box in the backseat
I can't believe these motherfuckers tried to X me
Once again I'm in the middle of some fuck shit
I busted a window, a dead nigger they left me stuck with
I grabbed my cellular phone and called my nigger Face
Had to beep him, 911 he wasn't in his place
The phone rang I picked it up I heard what's up Black?
'"Some hoe ass niggaz bust a cap and shot my nigga Matt
They killed my nigga now them hoes are after me
Just dump the body and meet me over at the draft 'G'
7 o'clock I dumped the body now I'm changing cars
Getting up with Face it's time to take them hoes to war
Called up Billy to meet us on the south west
Bring a bag of Buddha sinse and an extra vest
And to fit the [unverified] VNG to get this shit right
'Cause there's about to be a murder after midnight
Say what?
3 or 4 minutes to twelve o'clock, rolling in an
Undercover hunting 4 an' [unverified] Adrock
Let's hit the spot and find them hoes that tried to cap ya
Were they Killers yeah, or were they tried to jack ya?

We spotted a 'Z' off at Quarter Lane I'm killing the bitch
I don't know the man
Creped up slow dropped the back window
Yeah now what's up hoe?
Let off a couple of shots but he had posse
The nigga came out the door and like just shot me
It didn't hit me 'cause I duck down
We jumped our ass out the car and turned
That bitch into [unverified] Book Town
I bring my gats to a fist fight and bust a cap
In the bitch and it ain't gotta be at midnight
Eleven forty five I pull up on the set
With some down ass niggaz and a van full of gats
Jumped out fired up my Philly had to bust some shots
Had to let them know Bushwick Bill is on the fucking block
Niggaz start hauling as I heard Big Mike calling
Jumped in the van slammed the door and started hauling
Ass around the corner catch the nigga who would ran
Oki jumped out and went to bust him once again, uh
Making niggaz take cover fast 'cause
We was putting something on they motherfuckin' ass
Yeah, nine millimeter shells, twelve gauge pumps and shit
So nigga don't bother running for your trunk and shit

All Bido said is that it happened after midnight
