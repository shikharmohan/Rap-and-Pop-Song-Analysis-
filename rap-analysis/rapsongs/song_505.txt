Ain't it fucked up that when you work real hard
To get some shit and finally make it to the top of shit
That it's a whole gang of muthafuckas that hate
That shit and wanna take that shit
Nigga don't you hate on me, why don't you go and get you some
  (Don't hate on me, don't hate on me)
Don't you hate on me, why don't you go and get you some
  (Go get you some, go get you some)
Nigga don't you hate on me, why don't you go and get you some
  (Don't hate on me, don't hate on me)
Don't you hate on me, why don't you go and get you some
  (Go get you some, go get you some)
Nigga don't you hate on me, why don't you go and get you some
  (Don't hate on me, don't hate on me)

  (Don't hate on me, don't hate on me)
Don't you hate on me, why don't you go and get you some
  (Go get you some, go get you some)
Nigga don't you hate on me muthafucka
Go get you some get off my dick bitch get out my mix
And tell me where the real niggas at put your blunts in the air
Y'all niggas get fried to this tear the roof off the motha
Tell me who the thuggish in this muthafucka
What you niggas really wanna do be ballas flossin'
Niggas wanna be me so they gotta be talkin'
Oh, we been hearin' what they say
And when I'm in they face what you say
Oh, nothin' busta hit him in his shit anyway, hey
That's how we play still thuggin' ain't a thang changed
Still the same name Leather Face
Real, real niggas that's all I gotta say you're fuckin'
With the real you're bound to get dusted
Really the real ain't shit to be fucked with
Protected by the Nina we ain't care for them nigga
The trigger finger itchy fix ya then hit up the whole block
Make a nigga close shop sho' nuff show-stopper
Fuckin' 'em up with these sawed-offs
Pumpin' the shotgun really unnecessary
'Cause all we want is a little respect that's all we want
But nigga you don't feel me, nigga you don't
Krayzie, Krayzie maybe insane and he with JD
Let it rip done slipped a clip into the gat Brat-tat-tat just like that
I ain't fin to be the bitch to procrastinate
If niggas wanna be shippin' me half a cake
Go through whatever drastic measures I have to take
Make a muthafucka masturbate
The hotter I get the more hate
Some of you hoes is overrated with flows
That's outdated take 'em to the rehab and get 'em reinstated
My lyrical content send other bitches to convents
Pray for me to be deleted but that's nonsense
Been the bomb since '74
Aries I can see how ya nigga be lookin' at me
He wanna get in between the sheets
Leave the wallet and the keys for me
I ain't persuade that easily but if you spend the cheese for me
Nigga we can fuck free frequently
You study me but another me could never be so
Broke the mold 6-0-6-4-4
when niggas are hauled off and hit you with the sawed-off
Seen plenty muthafuckas fall off with they drawers off
When I'm finished droppin' 'em all off on the West side of Chi
I'm ridin' high thinkin' of ways to make it through
The maze of the paper chase slidin' by
Keep a Luger in the chamber ready for danger when it's time to die
Nigga don't you hate on me, why don't you go and get you some
  (Don't hate on me, don't hate on me)
Don't you hate on me, why don't you go and get you some
  (Go get you some, go get you some)
Nigga don't you hate on me, why don't you go and get you some
  (Don't hate on me, don't hate on me)
Don't you hate on me, why don't you go and get you some
  (Go get you some, go get you some)
Nigga don't you hate on me, why don't you go and get you some
  (Don't hate on me, don't hate on me)
Don't you hate on me, why don't you go and get you some
  (Go get you some, go get you some)
Nigga don't you hate on me, why don't you go and get you some
  (Don't hate on me, don't hate on me)
Don't you hate on me, why don't you go and get you some
  (Go get you some, go get you some)
See everywhere I go I feel like niggas be tryin' to get me stuck
I'm fly no matter what iced-up and all the hoes wanna fuck
Not to mention that a nigga got KT stacked-up, packed up
Everything I touch gold and platinum, what?
Niggas can't fuck with us like Busta Bust we dangerous
And you know that if I peel I got more y'all peel it's gone
It's why the ice grill on when I wheel on by y'all
Niggas in the corner back and forth
Like, "Fuck that little guy" don't worry
About me you need to worry about your goddamn self
How your shit on the shelf and how you sit around
Wishin' that a nigga was signed to So So Def
I'm a A T L A N T A, nig never been known to play with
Can't none of y'all see so y'all niggas don't really need to say shit, uh-uh
With all your people hatin' people hatin' and your bad looks
What y'all need to do is shut up and take heed
To what my nigga's sayin' in the hook
Nigga don't you hate on me, why don't you go and get you some
  (Don't hate on me, don't hate on me)
Don't you hate on me, why don't you go and get you some
  (Go get you some, go get you some)
