[Damien Marley (Eve)]
Now this one is elementary
We going to end it for the century
Ruff Ryder evolution presentary
Rag-a-muffin play-mentry
Yo (Uh, Come On, yo) Bumba
(Chorus)  (x2)
[Eve - *singing*]
No, No, No
You don't love me and I know now

Cause you left me baby
And I got no place to go now
(Bridge)  (x2)
No, No, No

Cause if you ask me baby
I'll get on my knees and pray boy
Uh huh uh, uh huh (yo) uh huh (yo)
(Bridge #2)  (x2)
[Eve - *singing*]
You say that you love me but how could you lie
You say that you love me but why could you lie
How could you take my heart and leave me with
I don't know why 
(Chorus)  (x2)
[Eve - *rapping*]
Yo, yo, yo
Walk Hennessey-ya, brown skin
Pretty thin, Keep coming at ya like Bumba see you in
Slim nicey round thing, momma say what a disgrace
Who the number 1 killer but lover is a bounty chase
Never my fault then who it is nigga
Most dem love my style even dem say she rude
Mi a lie Mi not lie the truth speak 2g
What you think them lovers give a jack bout me
Ruff Ryder Ryde or Die jack bout we
Ruff Ryder Ryde or Die jack bout we
We, we, we
[Damien Marley]
Mack to wrist to my girl I love the best
But when you left me it's like a bullet to my chest
Now I got to say I got a bullet through vest
Knocked off my feet I pleaded no contest
Sleepless nights without no sleep or rest
This is like a muffin jury you got to mix
Take it no more and had to make her confess
Sometimes I feel I'm in the Wild, Wild West
Lost the love I had now I live to the death
[Stephen Marley (Damien Marley)]
Long as I she caught me lying I get caught for lying
If she sure believe then sure believe is the sign
But listening to promises what a fool am I
Can somebody tell me?  You know all his life
I'm just trying to be friendly, but I'm losing my mind
The news that your moving got me standing outside
Use to be rubber ducky late nights no wine
Mrs. Lovely Vessel body all mine
Girl went to shoot me with the shoot all mind
Sweet like a puppy, is so hard to find
And I know you don't love me, I'm reading the signs
Cause there's no where to go since you left me behind
(Now it's TRUE, TRUE) that I loved you for truth
(TRUE, TRUE) she stick like ankle glue
(TRUE, TRUE)  I make your gray skies blue
(TRUE, TRUE) you want me pers-nal boo
Chilling up on the house our love be that strong
DJ's steady playing on the one's and two's
(Chorus)  (x2)
