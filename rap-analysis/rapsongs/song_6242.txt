(verse 1)
I used to know this woman who had the most beautiful
tattoos on the top sides of both of her hands
she was forty three years old and as far as I know
had never yet been with a man
its not that she wasn't attractive she was beautiful
but its the way that she interacted
she was aggressively passive to the point where she
would of intimidated any myth that ever tried to catch it
on the right hand she had a tattoo of a nude girl
she claimed it is what God resembled
but on the left she had a mirrored image of the same female
and this one she explained looked like the devil
I remember once watching her touch her own breasts
how the tattoos smiled as they stared down her stomach
as if anticipating when they'd be alive and caressed
sweet flower that they both seemed ta hung with (sweet flower)
now maybe I was high but it felt so right
heaven and hell both take till this woman's warm
it didn't make sense how she could-commence
touching herself with me wide awake in the same room
but if I've learned anything in my years (my years)
I learned I no longer believe in surprise (in surprise)
but what happened next damn near stole my tears
the tattoos came alive right in front of my eyes
they both slowly stood up and climbed off her hands
and showed me why she never took some time with a man
they climbed deep inside of this woman's garden
she closed her eyes and she gently bit her bottom lip
I stepped I left and I don't regret leaving
and I'd never forget all the things I saw that evening
a glimpse of religion a piece of coming closer
to understanding more about what intrigues me most
I didn't get turned on I just got turned
I wasn't as aroused as I was concerned
for each one of em I've hurt
and every time I think burned
I've got a lot to teach but even more to learn
so now I keep my eyes open hoping to take in all I can
about women taking in all she can
and for as long as I breath I'd stay reciting my memory
for that woman with the tattooed hands
(chorus: repeat 5x till song fades)
There's good an evil in each individual find
identifies needs and feeds I desire
as long as we keep our spirit inspired
she can bite her bottom lip all she wants
