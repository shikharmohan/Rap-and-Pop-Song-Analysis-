It's like, yo, there ain't too many people I would die for
That I would lay down for, you heard?
It's like my family, my closest friends that's in my circle
You know I mean? My moms and 'em, my babies, man
I keep it on the limit tho', that's what it is
That's right, tho', just some real shit
Yo, I can a die for the prophets and I'll die for the Lord
On the battlefield, wounded badly, holding a sword
With no questions asked, I already know, it's all for the cause
Just lay me facing the East, when I'm under the floor
I might've sinned in the process, from being, in the projects
Eyes swept from all the anger, that could've fucked with my conscience
And more or less, I'm a man of my word
My body is holding a couple scars on it, though I was never a bird
For Martin Luther and my brother Malcolm
(I'll die for you)
And my ancestors picking cotton
(I'll die for you)
My close homies that get it popping
(I'll die for you)
You what time it is, nigga, what?
  (I'd like to)
Aiyo, I'd die for my moms, and I'd die for my kids
If you, really my Queen, then I'd die for my ways
Even my mans, if we that tight
Jump in front of a biscuit, snuff money with all of my might
Or we can brawl it out and take his life by taking his gun, no problem
Just make sure we eating when we on the run
Like slaves that's chained together, who killed master?
The dogs is coming, the pigs is gon' blast ya
I'd die for you, I'd die for my brother
Die for the babies who can't eat with bare feet who need they mother
I put niggaz lights out like Con Ed, my verbal is barn
My bread'll blow you, show you who's real with the arms
Don't you want revenge on that devil, Satan?
(I'll die for you)
We can do it now instead of waiting
(I'll die for you)
We don't have to wait for Revelations
(I'll die for you)
We'll sort this out in other conversations
  (I'd like to)
Yo, I'd never jump out the window, lose my life for a lame ass nigga
That scene is bogus, it's not in the picture
You just can't feed me anything like, "Yo, Tone it's beef"
Expect me to go all out, jump in and bust my heat
First off, drunk, you ain't my peeps
Yeah, I know you, we from the same town and shit
But we ain't that deep, we never stuck nothing
Oxed some, ran together, popped some
I thought ya team was Wolves, cocksucker, stop fronting
You barking like you got the town in a smash
I'd never lay down for you, faggot, nigga, you ass
Wop them niggaz that be yelling that
(I'll die for you)
When they broke you be hearing that
(I'll die for you)
Just stick 'em for they packs, they be crying
(I'll die for you)
And just bitch mothafuckas burn
  (I'd like to, aight)
I'll die for you
