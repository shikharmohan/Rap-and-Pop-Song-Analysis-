Damn, I let my guard down, that's fucked up
I let yo' ass in when I shoulda kept you locked out
But it's all gravy, it happen to all of us, you know?
You get hurt, you hurt back, you reap what you sow
In the beginning when I met you
I didn't mean to be rude but I had to sweat you
'Cause you had me wet, ooh, I couldn't let you get away
'Cause then, when will I see you again another day
Your face was all I needed to see on a daily basis
And my heart in your hands would make it all gravy
But I was mistaken highly, you slid shit right by me
Bein' deceitful and hiding, keepin' secrets
But still keepin' me smilin', invitin' hoes to your party
Lord knows, I don't wanna get started, I'ma hurt somebody
Regardless I'ma love you for what we been through
But keepin' you is somethin' I can't do
If you get somebody, not just anybody
Get somebody who's gon' love you like nobody
Get somebody, don't tell everybody
'Cause somebody gon' try to crash yo' party
If you get somebody, not just anybody
Get somebody who's gon' love you like nobody
Get somebody, don't tell everybody
'Cause somebody gon' try to crash yo' party
As much as I miss ya, I can't get wit' cha
We painted a perfect picture
But I can see clearer now that the rain is gone
But the pains still come on strong
Every so often I get discombobulated
Call in Miss Cleo to see what the tarot cards are sayin'
Hopin' that she know how to help a bitch out or suttin'
Give me your lucky number to come up on motherfuckers
That keep frontin', I'm no fool, you only get one strike here
Blew it, so I won't be right here
The best friend you claimed that you ever had is gone
And it happened because you left me alone
Sing a song for me
If you get somebody, not just anybody
Get somebody who's gon' love you like nobody
Get somebody, don't tell everybody
'Cause somebody gon' try to crash yo' party
If you get somebody, not just anybody
Get somebody who's gon' love you like nobody
Get somebody, don't tell everybody
'Cause somebody gon' try to crash yo' party
An' now that it's over that predicament taught me
To be a soldier an' stay at attention
Fold my collar up an' pop it an' keep hollarin'
At the rich niggaz with deep pockets that keep me goin' shoppin'
I'm better now than ever now
You never found somebody quite like me to stay down
Whatever is meant to be, be that
And whoever is sent to me, be crashed
If you get somebody, not just anybody
Get somebody who's gon' love you like nobody
Get somebody, don't tell everybody
'Cause somebody gon' try to crash yo' party
If you get somebody, not just anybody
Get somebody who's gon' love you like nobody
Get somebody, don't tell everybody
'Cause somebody gon' try to crash yo' party
Check it out, no matter what you do
You cant let 'em crash your party
Get you somebody that's gonna
Lad dee da dee who came to party
If you get somebody, not just anybody
If you get somebody, not just anybody
If you get somebody, not just anybody
Get somebody who's gon' love you like nobody
Get somebody, don't tell everybody
'Cause somebody gon' try to crash yo' party
If you get somebody, not just anybody
Get somebody who's gon' love you like nobody
Get somebody, don't tell everybody
'Cause somebody gon' try to crash yo' party
If you get somebody, not just anybody
Get somebody who's gon' love you like nobody
Get somebody, don't tell everybody
'Cause somebody gon' try to crash yo' party
If you get somebody, not just anybody
Get somebody who's gon' love you like nobody
Get somebody, don't tell everybody
'Cause somebody gon' try to crash yo' party
Get somebody, not just anybody
Get somebody, love you like nobody
Get somebody, don't tell everybody
Get somebody, get you somebody
