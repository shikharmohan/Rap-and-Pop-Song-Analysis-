Yeah we gon' send this one out
To everybody that put mo' into they cars
Than they do they relationship
Let's ride
Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you
Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you
Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you
It's get out put my pedal to the flo and let's roll
Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you
Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you
Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you
It's get out put my pedal to the flo and let's roll
Yes 7 cars, 8 cribs
And ain't a damn thing changed
I'm still pumpin' 10 kickers
Still grippin' the grain
Still candy in the paint
Still ridin' them things
And most my folks would say
I'm happy but I still feel pain
Until I jump in my ride
That's my only escape
Me and my automobile's got these neighbors screamin
"Gimme a break"
It's a pity how we turn our city
Into obstacle courses
Don't be mad 'coz I can't hold my
500 horses
Lamborghinis and Porsches
Ferraris and Vipers
I'm a wipe the seats witcho drool
Then rub the hood with a diaper
Television on the gas tank
The fuel make the ass stank
I mean to be rude
My bass tubes are in a glass tank
Go strap your seatbelts on
Go put your money up
Go put your life on the line
Go put your honey up
Go spread the word
Run and tell all the boys
It's time to play or better yet
It's time to bring out them toys we goin'
Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you
Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you
Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you
It's get out put my pedal to the flo and let's roll
Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you
Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you
Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you
It's get out put my pedal to the flo and let's roll

Yo one of my ways of releasin' tension
While I'm releasin' some steam
Even if I just put a fresh coat of wax on I'm makin' sure
The slippers is clean
The 26's is mean
Shut down the block nigga picture the fiends
My system supreme
You can feel the knock just picture the scene
The chickens just scream
Whole crew ballin' they sick of my team
We gettin' the cream
I'm through hollerin' I'm livin' my dream
I'm black with a scheme
Won't stop until that fat lady sings
And yeah it's actual and factual
What my faculty brings
A car show for whatever we slide
And wherever we glide
You keep your rules and regulations man
'Coz we don't abide
And we lookin' alive Mercedes Benz
6 or the 5
In a Beamer, Lexus or AC we don't know
How to act when we drive
And I fiend for the ride
I lay back and lean to the side
On lookers and turnin' heads
Is all that's seen through his eyes
I'm breezin' on by
And no doubt it's easy to fly
But it's even better when you slow down
Or ease to the side and go
Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you
Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you
Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you
It's get out put my pedal to the flo and let's roll
Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you
Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you
Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you
It's get out put my pedal to the flo and let's roll
I'm ridin' up in, GTO's, and fo-fo two's
Grand Prixs, S.S's 'coz we so so cool
Ridin' Regals or the 'llacs, we in Chevelles and Verts
Skylarks, motorcycles, A.T.V's with the works
Malibus and Camaros, T-Birds and Novas
Escalades, Navigators, Expeditions and Rovers
H2's and Denalis, pickup trucks with the beams
Crown Vics, Monte Carlos, even Cutlass Supremes are goin'
Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you
Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you
Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you
It's get out put my pedal to the flo' and let's roll
Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you
Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you
Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you
It's get out put my pedal to the flo' and let's roll
