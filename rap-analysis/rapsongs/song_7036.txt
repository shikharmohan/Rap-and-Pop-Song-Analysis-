[WYCLEF] 
I woke up this morning 
I was feeling kind of high 
It was me, Jesus Christ and Haile Selassie 
Selassie said greetings in the name of the most high, 
Jah Rhastafari, 
Christ, took a sip of the Amaretto, 
Passed it down the table said today I'll be betrayed by one you 12 
disciples 
Give me a clue who could do this to you? 
The kid on the block who makes less money than you. 
Crooked cops pulled up, they offered him 30 pieces of silver 
All he got to do is deliver the savior 
Right on Bergen St. from bad luck to good luck 
My cup runneth over, pass it down, guzzle up 
The time has arrived, the prophecy will manifest 
I saw death, I got scared, butterflies on my chest 
Father if possible, pass this cup before me, 
But it's too late I chose my destiny in Gethsemane. 
[LAURYN] 
You see I loved hard once, but the love wasn't returned 
I found out the man I'd die for, he wasn't even concerned 
And time it turned, 
He tried to burn me like a perm 
Though my eyes saw the deception, My heart wouldn't let me learn 
From um, some, dumb woman, was I, 
And everytime he'd lie, he would cry and inside I'd die. 
My heart must have died a thousand deaths 
Compared myself to Toni Braxton thought I'd never catch my breath 
Nothing left, he stole the heart beating from my chest 
I tried to call the cops, that type of thief you can't arrest 
Pain suppressed, will lead to cardiac arrest 
Diamonds deserve diamonds, but he convinced me I was worth less 
when my peoples would protest, 
I told them mind their business, cause my s*** was complex 
More than just the sex 
I was blessed, but couldn't feel it like when I was caressed 
I'd spend nights clutching my breasts overwhelmed by God's test 
I was God's best contemplating death with a Gillette 
But no man is ever worth the paradise MANIFEST 
[PRAZ] 
Gun-clap Shell cap, 
Got them crawling on they back 
Come through with the Fu 
They be who the F**k is that 
It's unpredictable, when my tongue performs like Jujitsu 
Cut you with my lyrics, stab you with my pencil 
Lethal injection, witness protection 
Refugee camp's under investigation 
Gunshot bursts in all directions 
For the wack MC's we read your revelations 
Discharge through your pores 
Get raw and kill Boors 
I can Capleton when I'm on a Tour 
Some manifest, with slugs in they chest 
God bless all the Cowboys in the Wild Wild West
