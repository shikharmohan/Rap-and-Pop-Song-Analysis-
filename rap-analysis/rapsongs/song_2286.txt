Yo, Dre, man, I take this bitch out to the movies and shit man
We're kissin' and grindin' and shit, so we hop in the back seat
You know, man, this bitch rubbin' all over my dick and frontin'
Like she's gonna give me the pussy, man and the bitch
Said three words, man, stop, no and don't, I said bitch
You don't have to front on me, dear
So why don't you just give that pussy here?
If you'd be good to me, oh I'll be good to you
And we'll both ride home in my automobile
All that I want is a little puss
All that I want is just a little head
If you'd be good to me, ohh, I'll be good to you
And we'll both ride home in my automobile
You don't have to front on me, bitch, don't be afraid
It's only a dick, give up the pussy soon, all I want is a little
Or get your groopy ass out my hotel room
Or get your groopy ass out my hotel room
All I want is the pussy, all I want is the pussy
All I want is the pussy, all I want is the pussy
If you'd be good to me, oh, I'll be good to you
And we'll both ride home in my automobile
We'll both ride home in my automobile
