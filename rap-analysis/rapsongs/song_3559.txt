Y'all illi I'm iller, I'm from Illinois. Yo Big Shaun why don't you call ya Chi-Town boys. Show me where they at I will destroy you. 'Bout to fuck somethin' up I might as well call the lawyer. Good music run this bitch, yes we do. I know you think that damn I wish shay would bless me too. In the bull fight, in the restroom, it's best you go 'head and kiss the Jesus piece, 'cuz I just blessed you. Uh, in holy water Issac gave Shay a slaughter, ever since the day that I opened up that midnight marauder. Now it's gon be ya problem like a brand new installment from the late great Mr. Christopher Wallace. They call us pompous, can I be honest? Honestly modesty wasn't ever in my policy.
