This one right here goes out to all the fake thugs out there 
Yeah yeah uh huh 
Yo when you say you thuggin it doesn matter 
It goes into my mind as just chit chatter 
You may say I have a ego or just maybe three 
But none of that tough luck I take seriously 
It goes in one ear and right out the other 
Heard that fake thug shit? brotha 
I don't mean to brag, never never hate 
You ain't got the bank that it takes to stop this 
Ha (ha) ha (ha) ha (ha) ha sucker you missed 
I put feelings inside, you know who I am 
P-U-2-F, keys to the U.S. 
And I hate when one, attempts to analyze 
Franchise get your hands tied 
Thrown over a boat, don't know what you was thinking 
That dream is over, your body sinking

You got it ziplocked (that's right) 
Everybody hits the floor when the shit drops 
This shit knocked, bitch stop (bitch, stop) 
We brawl, we pile, we all night long 
We don't stop, niggas thought the heat was gone 
But I'm back to do it again, lead up rhymes 
BAD BOY, we turn into the scene of the crime 
I'm accurate, damn you can have that shit 
I just wanna get a slide with the baddest bitch 
Models and actresses, that swallow 
Bottles, that magnum shit 
Get, nice as fuck, leave when the lights is up 
Tear it down when the mics is up 
Lately they say Diddy's gettin nice as hell 
Shit, if I don't write it I recite it well 
Locked the flow, so tight you got to know 
I'm tight with my glock and my dough 
Motherfuckers

You might catch a flight if you playing me right 
But if you whack there you gettin cab fare 
Yo, I'm more for drama little clap clap there 
I mean I ain't Ghandi of this whole rap gear 
But you see honey what I'm rappin with there? 
All I need is a minute to get back to the lair 
Back where it is let's trap the deal, where 
Cease is with a few of his pieces

And don't you come back no more no more no more
