Me an' my partner in my Impala
Poppin' our collars, tossin' up dollars
A truck on the side of us with hoes that wanna follow
Bet a hundred dollars that they all wanna swallow
Doggy Doggfather
I do it to you real hard, then it gets harder
It's nada thang on mine, I bang on mine
I smoke an ounce an' bounce at the same time
It's off the limbo with Timbo, you motherfuckin' bimbo
So quit knockin' at my window, you nymphomaniac
Bring it back, now shake it up
Put it on the table, now break it up
Give it to me, now put a lighter on the end of it
It really don't matter what you spent on it
As long as you're gettin' what you paid for
That's what it made for, ain't that what you stayed for?
Who's that dippin' in the Cadillac? Snoop Dogg
Smoke 'til your eyes get cataracts, Snoop Dogg
Who got a girl layin' on her back? Snoop Dogg
Who that makin' that paper stack? Snoop Dogg
You play me an' I'll play you
You pay me an' I'll pay you
Hold on, boo, you got the game all wrong
This ain't yo' thang, this my song
Move on, we in the club at the Shark Bar
Valeted my keys an' park my car
No snap shots 'cause I might get popped
As I slide by security, givin' 'em props
First thing I do when I get in
Let me take you back to when I first slid in
Grab my gi-din, get my pid-in
Put my bid in, no bullshittin'
We be sittin' in a corner
With smoke comin' from up under us
Like we sittin' in the sauna
Burnin' up the charts
Break a bitch heart, lil' mama don't you start
Who's that dippin' in the Cadillac? Snoop Dogg
Smoke 'til your eyes get cataracts, Snoop Dogg
Who got a girl layin' on her back? Snoop Dogg
Who that makin' that paper stack? Snoop Dogg

Tick tock, the ice on my watch
Slap me 'cross the face around two o'clock
But the party don't stop 'til we blow up
Now every lil' bitch wanna show up
Manuev'in' to this, groovin' to this
Dippin' to this, flippin' to this, trippin' to this
Ain't no skippin' to this, trust this
Bust this, it's too hot to touch this
He say, she say, I say no way
Don't need foreplay, okay, obey
Everything that I say
An' every day'll be like a holiday
I put you in the front seat of my car
An' roll you 'round town like a superstar
Recline your seat an' turn up the beat
Number one with a bullet
Rollin' down the motherfuckin' backstreets
Who's that dippin' in the Cadillac? Snoop Dogg
Smoke 'til your eyes get cataracts, Snoop Dogg
Who got a girl layin' on her back? Snoop Dogg
Who that makin' that paper stack? Snoop Dogg
