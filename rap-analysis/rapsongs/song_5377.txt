Beware, you're now listening
To the sounds of Mis-Demeanor
Turn everything up, all the levels
All the fuckin' levels
Missy be the name
Missy be the name
Missy be the name
Missy be the name and y'all should already know
I been around long Scarface so cold
Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yo she ya
Let me grab the microphone and I'm gone take it away
Every time I spit I blow one or two speakers
Top model diva but my name not Eva
Yeah, I brang fever rockin' classic Adidas
I'm straight off the heater rippin' needles off the meter
Here I go, flip my flow
Back it up then I drop it low
It's a must 'cause I'm dangerous
I'll be a hassle on the busta call me Angeldust
I talk shit di, didn't stutter
2005 MC's in trouble
You run for cover hide under your covers
'Cause you gone need more protection than a magnum rubber
Uh uh on, uh uh on, uh uh uh uh, uh uh on
And it's uh uh on, uh uh on, uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Uh uh on, uh uh on, uh uh uh uh, uh uh on
And it's uh uh on, uh uh on, uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Missy finna spit this simply raw
Misdemeanor always make MC's feel small
Stick you on the table with a plastic cup
Say grace, then eat ya ass up
Y'all just rookies, virgins, and nookies
Not my competition, you skip or play hookie
Aint nobody here that can tear the track up
And naw I ain't done rappin' so shut the hell up
Keep it simple every time I flow
If you step to me, I shall throw blows
Raise up like I's break nose
I ain't about talkin', I'll lay 'em down slow
And for show y'all know
Mis-Demeanor got 'em by the neck, hit 'em low
Ice cold heart like zero below
If you wanna battle me then playa say so
Uh uh on, uh uh on, uh uh uh uh, uh uh on
And it's uh uh on, uh uh on, uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Let me tell you what I'm all about
About spitting hot rhymes on out
Yeah Pharrell did the beat oh yes
And the way he put it down he make it sound so fresh
I be the best don't second guess
When it comes to other rappers 'bout it boy get flexed
When I say I'm tight as wife beaters
Missy 'bout to teach you how to follow the leader
Hit the club in a blue two seater
Lookin' like I'm finna cock a nine millimeter
Get out with my highhill cuffs
Twisting my ass 'cause I know what guys want
Licking my lips like I'm takin' him home
Teasing and teasing, I'm fakin the funk
Shaking my titties like I wanna bone
Bend over slow then I tell him, I'm gone
Uh uh on, uh uh on, uh uh uh uh, uh uh on
And it's uh uh on, uh uh on, uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Missy be the name and y'all should already know
Missy be the name and y'all should already know
Missy be the name
Missy be the name
Missy be the name
