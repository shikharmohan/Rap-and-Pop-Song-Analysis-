When I done it you know I did it to death
So sit back 'n hold ya breath
I don't know 'bout dem, I really ran these streets
So listen up this shit get deep
You know I'm smokin' the best, I ain't got to brag
The young fly nigga with tha Georgia swag, yeah
The seats swede so is the pipe
And try tell Minisota, show us tha Vikings
Inside so soft can't believe, it's not butter
Snowman bitch did I stu stu studder
Came straight from the hood, right to the big screen
The way da boy ball we'll swear he had hoop dreams
No grants, no scholarships
Had to make my own way, I still stake dem chips
The homie from the block put me down with da knowledge
Straight to tha pros, ya I swerve past college
(What you talkin' bout)
Livin' my life 'n I'ma get it all no matter the price
When I did it you know I done it da best
Sit back and just hold ya breath, just hold ya breath
(What you talkin' bout)
Changin' the game in show you how these rappin' ass niggas is lames
When I did it you know I done it da best
Sit back and just hold ya breath, just hold ya breath
They say da blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the blacker the rims the sweeter the Coupe
The money goes out that sack comes in
I can't even lie I do it all again
I flip the rap game just like the work
And it was snow white just like my shirt
Counted so much paper, seen so many haters
Seen bricks stacked tall as sky scrapers
Goddamn dats high
Done everything I said so I am that fly
Every dude was a troop tell me who came realer
The word on the street is that I'm still that nigga
(What you talkin' bout)
Livin' my life 'n I'ma get it all no matter the price
When I did it you know I done it da best
Sit back and just hold ya breath, just hold ya breath
(What you talkin' bout)
Changin' the game in show you how these rappin' ass niggas is lames
When I did it you know I done it da best
Sit back and just hold ya breath, just hold ya breath
Between love 'n hate there's a thin ass line
I think we all can agree last summer was mine
And if ya don't say my name, den you wastin' ya time
And if I don't rub my watch, then I'm wastin' my shine
Spend a hundred on a homie, den sit tha time
A few mill before the deal and I'm still on da grind
The cridits criditsize me 'cause a nigga talkin' yay
I ain't suga coati'n shit this is who I am
Nigga you been to da A, seen me makin' it rain
Seen it wit ya own eyes you know dis shit ain't a game
So you niggas listen closely to what I'm sayin'
If ya game ain't money den I ain't playin'
(What you talkin' bout)
Livin' my life 'n I'ma get it all no matter the price
When I did it you know I done it da best
Sit back and just hold ya breath, just hold ya breath
(What you talkin' bout)
Changin' the game in show you how these rappin' ass niggas is lames
When I did it you know I done it da best
Sit back and just hold ya breath, just hold ya breath
