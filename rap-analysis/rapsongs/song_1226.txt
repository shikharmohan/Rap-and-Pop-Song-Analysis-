When people stare at the scene like a machine of the team
Looking for theme between cracks searching for cream
Physical image can never be lost, never be cleverly read
Or took on into the search of your own, suckers are looking
For treasures and pleasures endeavors images of plastic
Material whenever your ready your steady rolling with deadly
And friendly territorial glorious story you've heard nothing
But bull for me, coming from ghetto the Guero the heart in the metal
Settle for gas as we passing you fast in the pedal
Head to the floor and the horror is starting to pour
Everything I just threatened your blood you can't take it no more
Why did you try to forget it I said it to fuck off
Now you'll be headed said I'm making you try to do laws
That's what you get for faking it hot and no more
Living I'm sucker I'm pushing the bomb
Do what you want do what you need the hardcore
Breaking the law the new seed yes they want more
Cypress Hill Soul Assassins we smokin' 420 all day
We ain't joking serve it up, oh yes and the hard stuff
Excess of the Zes make it sound right beat it up all you want
It's a damn right, get up in my way I'll cross your ass like dust
This is loaded with snakes serpents who come and they take
Pieces of those who they break bodies are found in the lake
Only the victims it's pass you thought that you gonna last
Pockets all over the cash now that you're actually grass
High kids taking and slipping away look at you tricking
And sipping its clicking the trigger and so is your place
Only the strong will survive hoping to keep 'em alive
I'll never be denied watch on who you can find
People around and they're proud looking for those
Who obey dying like these killas defy so I keep up
The withdrawal, join fucking with the pace your just a waste
In my face hit you in base in your case if all you want is a taste
Even the lemo the rebel bringing the metal in temple
So many rebels incredible time we battle
You looking for action don't judge us avenge us redempt us
Don't give me negligence your all though in time no revenges
Do what you want do what you need the hardcore
Breaking the law the new seed yes they want more
Cypress Hill Soul Assassins we smokin' 420 all day
We ain't joking serve it up, oh yes and the hard stuff
Excess of the Zes make it sound right beat it up all you want
It's a damn right, get up in my way I'll cross your ass like dust
Under the heavens we representing directions of flesh
And feeling the heat the tension now dissin' we stressin'
Life is a battle to the cattle you gonna die, just how that'll
Just suffer your glad you built up your high and go up the
Chain the pages keep turning and burning the rage is concerning
The day is becoming disarming searching for harmony
You wanna be balling me but you never get no where 'cause
I'm killing your whole philosophy, robbing like temperature
I signal your flow when we just clowning just tell me just pass me
Watch me I'm truly tampering y'all must be simple delinquent
To try to get what the sick is so leave the hard is to limp it
And only the thrill will we get it? I'm an assassin of soul out of control
When I roll you better hide in your hole I got your name on my skull
There ain't no running from me assassin of hunees you see
Blastin' at those who obey blasting at last at the weak!
Do what you want do what you need the hardcore
Breaking the law the new seed yes they want more
Cypress Hill Soul Assassins we smokin' 420 all day
We ain't joking serve it up, oh yes and the hard stuff
Excess of the Zes make it sound right beat it up all you want
It's a damn right, get up in my way I'll cross your ass like dust
