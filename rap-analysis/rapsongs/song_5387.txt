{Ya, you have come almost to the close of my album
But before I go
I just wanna thank God
For stayin' with me through my ups and downs
An' through my whole period of doin' this album
I want to thank Timberland
Who came up with the beats
And all the people that appeared on my album make it hot
I am out}
