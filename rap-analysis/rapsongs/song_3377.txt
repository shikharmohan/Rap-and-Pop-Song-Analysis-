i dont want you
but i need you
i love and hate you at the very same time
[ chorus ]

this is an emergency
and she claim she only with me for the currency
you cut me deep bitch

and i was too proud to admit
that it was hurting me
id never do that to you
at least purposely
we breaking up again
we making up again
but we dont love no more
i guess wee fucking then

and you mixed them emotions with tequila
and you mixed that with a little bad advice
on one of them bad nights
yall have a bad fight
and you talking bout her family
her aunts and shit
and she say motherfucker your mommas a bitch

i'd never hit a girl but i'd shake the shit out of you
but imma be the bigger man
big pimpin like jigga man
oh i guess i figga it's
bitter sweet

andmy niggas said i shouldntlet it worry me
and this relationship it even got me back to drinkin
and this hennessey is going to be the death of me
and you and cracked up to what you were supposed to be
you always gone you always be where those hoes will be
cause everytime i tried you would question me
