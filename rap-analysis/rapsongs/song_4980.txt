you aint seen no chicks like mine,
you aint seen no flicks like mine,

tell me that you like it raw,
tell me that my dick is plump,
i might make you famous, and buy you watches by maurice lacroix
tell me if its new or old,
tell me if its hot or cold,
let me know if its black & bold,
say ludacris 6 million sold.
see i aint got no time for games,
and i aint got no times for lames,
how you lovin my southern slang,
ooo eee walla walla bing bang.
so anytime you need me call,
whether summer, spring, or fall,
it doesnt matter come one come all,
either get dropped or drop them draws.
[Chorus X 2]
[Trina]

these rumors, are senseless,
your whispers, are endless.
