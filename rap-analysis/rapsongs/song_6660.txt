Midnight love, midnight love
Midnight love, midnight love, oh
Midnight love, troubles plots on thee mind
Midnight love, leave your back door open
Midnight love, this heaven's ready for me
Midnight love, back door little druggies callin' for you
I'm makin' things cappin' fast, ain't no need to wait around
For what never seems to come along
Face lookin' stupid broke startin' feelin' dumb
I'm young but I'm a grown man takin' thangs into my own hands
I'm tryin' to own here but life a twist ya like a twister
Get twisted with this it seems on but its off
I keep missin' this shit I'm high but I try, to stay focused wide out
Lookin' dead at the chips I blink they dip
It's hard to hang on but I can't let go smokin' on my last breath
Blow out life whats left is death
Now I can go on or I can G or make a right
Whatever way that I turn it's still death after life
It don't discourage me, I ain't got nuthin' to lose
But some punks that probably never turn the money to burn
But I learn 'cuz I see and I earn 'cuz I G
But these problems probably havin' niggaz prayin' to see
At an early age so at an early stage in life
I chose to get my ish tight ya gotta struggle and fight
It cost an arm and a leg just to live on your knees
And I'm tryin' to keep my sanity God help me please
Midnight love, troubles plots on thee mind
Midnight love, leave your back door open
Midnight love, this heaven's ready for me
Midnight love, back door little druggies callin' for you
Mischievous and devious is how my life was
Puttin' the serve down for cabbage just to keep the niggaz buzzed
Some of the money makin' muthafuckaz from the other side
Was thinkin' about a jack move tryin' to whoo-ride
Gettin' jealous 'cuz my music got this rap game sewn up
Them niggaz wanna trip whatever back they get blowed up
Blown up or not you can still get shot
You don't never play those muthafuckaz I'll always not
Rule number one, pay attention to this shit
Don't be fuckin' wit' my niggaz on the midnight shift
Shit shiggy shack, gettin' it on, to the break of dawn
Now he's known for servin' more than an OZ
So he's got a 187 on his muthafuckin' chest
A strap in his lap and a bulletproof vest
He's lookin' for the music from the night before
Trouble 1, he layin' low all in gettin' that dough
Midnight love, troubles plots on thee mind
Midnight love, leave your back door open
Midnight love, this heaven's ready for me
Midnight love, back door little druggies callin' for you
Now it's all about the dollars Impalas that bounce
Havin' cars and bitches on a proper amount
Caught a million chillin' robbin' banks for many muthaz son
Life and darkness we all get it started, cold hearted
All around it my life won't change for the good
As soon as I walk out the door, I'm called by the hood
Daz, would you come and ride for me
Hey yo Daz would you soldier would you would you and die for me
The tradition's got a lot of niggaz killin' for dumb shit
The OGs think they run shit the youngsters control shit
Every midnight I be loaded, high as a kite
Besides with the drama the dog fight street fight
And a lot a mob puttin' on mo
Problems solved but revolved whatever with a fo-fo
But sure I did the record blast five times
254 sentence to jail time
Midnight love, I've been walkin' the street
Midnight love, I put my life on the line
Midnight love, 'cuz I've just gotta be me
Midnight love
Midnight love, troubles plots on thee mind
Midnight love, leave your back door open
Midnight love, this heaven's ready for me
Midnight love, back door little druggies callin' for you
