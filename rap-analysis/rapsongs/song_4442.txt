Slut sucks nuts and all and nothin' small
This dick make 'em hit the floor and touch the wall
Call my hoes to get salami 'cuz they brush the balls
Let Weezy bust they jaws, never have no picks and chooses
'Cuz I hits and lose 'em and go to the hotel and switch for ruggy
Like a hot, spicy, fire, project girl ta duck wit me

Titty bop, drop it like it's hot, make it fall slow
Now walk wit me, shake a leg, catch the wall hoe
Ya gotta back ya ass wit, act a ass wit

At the same time I can fuck you and your best friend
The number 1 stunna, baby, you wit me
Bump in my head never let a bitch play me
Always get the Tec nigga, fuck 'em all
