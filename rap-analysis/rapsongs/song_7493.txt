[Method] Oh yeah, comin through with my Shaolin crew 
Two cent for a case, gimme St. Ide's brew 
In the midst of broken bottles and crushed up cans 
Methtical's in a jam on how dry I am 
[Raekwon] ... with St. Ides in my system 
crack another I'm blitzed, let's go hit the next one 
Hang it over, the object is to stay sober 
Lay on the sofa, better yet, dial my chauffeur 
[Ghostface] Who's the Wallabee kid, stressed out, could never be Son 
Ricochet daily hit the deli for a cold one 
Naturally blessed, yes, my rap is like a laser beam 
that blow between the bushes, St. Ide's and I the king of teams 
[U-God] Crack the bottle of the St. Ide's, sippin to those 
Who don't realize that drinkin ain't only to be drunk 
You can't drive, keep my peoples alive 
And if the saint don't know you from a can of paint 
[RZA] It was hot, on the spot, so I jetted at the block 
And I asked for St. Ide's, I could tell by the dot 
On the back he rebuilt it... not that charcoal filtered 
Ice cold bottle tilted... to my cup he spilt it 
AAAAAAAAAAH!!! ST. IDES! mmmmmmmmmmm...
