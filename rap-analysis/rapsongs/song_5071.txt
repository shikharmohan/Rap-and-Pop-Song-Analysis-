Fresh to def, she is
From her steps to her set, she is
So death might not let me live
Ya dig? Fresh, yes, she is
Had a feelin' that it would be a day like this
The orchestra in my mind don't play like this
Naw but I'm prepared for it, got a little rare for it
Brushed off my Airs, even cut my hair for it
'Cause normally I don't care for it
Don't even be lookin' for light like that
Then there it go, yeah, right over there
So I prepared to pour it, little scared
My stare lowered, mamma said have no fear
Plus I'm already outta my chair
Gathered up my airs on my square from here for it
It's nothing, right? So here go it
Whispered in her ear, it was crowded in here
Would she care to blow it? She said yeah
You're my sunshine, you're my moonlight
You're the starry skies above me
Won't you please come down and hug me?
Think I found love in this club tonight
Never met her before
But I think I like her like a metaphor
It's hard to get in the car, we sit from the intro
She rolled down the window just in case I was a schizo
I compliment on her common sense
I'm calm a little, more confident, uh huh
And then we lose consciousness
She says that, "I've been waitin' for you"
"And I know that you've been chasin' me too
Since they kidnapped me from my castle
I've been thinkin' of you
I told a fire breathin' dragon, he bet not harm me
Or be sorry when he meets my for my one man army"
"And thou has come to rescue me
My knight in shinin' armor, yes, you be"
Woken up by the horn of an S.U.V.
I said, "See too beautiful to let you sleep"
You're my sunshine, you're my moonlight
You're the starry skies above me
Won't you please come down and hug me?
Think I found love in this club tonight
Relationship is just 30 minutes long
It's kinda heavy, maybe a little strong
Goin' take much more than once
Can't trust what each of us say at least for a month
Or two before I bid you adieu, do this one thing for me
Out of the trillions of numbers that's in the world
Just leave me a few, they'll lead to you
Won't be long and I'll see you in the mornin', cool?
You're my sunshine, you're my moonlight
You're the starry skies above me
Won't you please come down and hug me?
Think I found love in this club tonight
You're my sunshine, you're my moonlight
You're the starry skies above me
Won't you please come down and hug me?
Think I found love in this club tonight
