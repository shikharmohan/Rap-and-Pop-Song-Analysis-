[Kanye West]
I love it though
I love it though
[Chorus]
Uh put your hands to the constellations
they way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preaching to the congregation
we love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan
I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting
we aint married but tonight I need some consummation
[Kanye West - Verse 1]
may the Lord forgive us
may the God's be with us
and that magic hour I seen good christians make rash decisions
oh she do it, what happened to Religion?
oh she lose it
she putting on her make up
she casually allure
text message break up, the casualty of tour
how she gone wake up and not love me no more
I thought I was the ass hole, I guess it's rubbing off
hood phenomenom, the Lebron of rhyme
hard to be humble when you stuntin on a jumbotron
I'm looking at her like "this what you really want it, huh?"
what we argue anyway, oh I forgot its summertime
[Chorus]
Uh put your hands to the constellations
they way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preaching to the congregation
we love Jesus but she done learned a lot from Satan (Satan, Satan, Satan)
I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting
we aint married but tonight I need some consummation
[Kanye West - Verse 2]
When the sun go down its the magic hour
the magic hour
and outta all the colours that are still up the skies
you got green on your mind
I can see it in your eyes
why you standing there with your face screwed up
don't leave while your hot that's how Mase screwed up
throwing shit around, the whole place screwed up
maybe I should call Mase so that he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered you jerk, she said "you are what you eat"
you see I always loved your sense of humour
but tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was
the Lyor Cohen or Dior Homme thats Dior Homme not Dior homie
the crib scarface couldn't be more Tony
you love me for me could you be more phoney
[Chorus]
Uh put your hands to the constellations
they way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
haven't said a word, haven't said a word
to me this evening
Cat got your tongue?
