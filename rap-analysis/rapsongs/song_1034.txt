Common: 
Fuck waitin under my skin the situation is scrapin 
Somewhat like the girl X ratin 
It's hard to be patient with no VCR or PlayStation 
Knowing your Rockports somebody may be lacin 
Make me wanna leave the city when I can't take a vacation 
Without somebody breakin in my demonstration 
For some South side information, I search the Nigga-net 
It certain things about this I ain't figure yet 
Dirt, the guy who stayed with me and had a set of keys 
Because his job had been stopped smokin weed 
Thursdays is off days, he usually watch his seed 
For him to have done it, a babysitter and a car he would need 
The stripper broad, my TV and couch, she couldn't carry it 
Unless some nigga helped and that's who she'll get buried with 
She was vegeterian and she wouldn't have cooked chicken 
I confronted her with it, to her story, she was stickin 
The plot thickens, as we drove in search of this hype 
Who I ain't know by name, but I knew by bike 
Chances of him breakin in, chillin and eatin 
Are about as slim as he is 
Though I knew where he lived 
In his house with three kids, one I was cool with 
As we roll, I told the guy, turn on the music 
Just as I thought I closed in on one suspect 
The nigga who did it popped the tape in the deck 
(Excerpt from a movie) 
Just tell me why. Don't lie to me man, just tell me why 
It's the money, alright? 
Just tell me why 
It's the fuckin money, alright? 
(fighting) 
Reynoldo, shoot that piece of shit

Know what I'm sayin. Word up
