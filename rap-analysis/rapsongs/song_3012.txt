It'll be all slippery, slick wid it automatically?
I'm the shit wid it, I'm psyched out, Sic-Wid-It
Like E-40 and The Click wid it
He sucker MC better know about it
I make your girlfriend hoe about it
I make a muh'fucka know about it
Somebody better tell him cock it back, hit a lick wid it
Keep it workin' drop a brick wid it
Off the block, serve a nig wid it, whip a brand new whip wid it
Apartment flow, you ain't know?
Look here lil' girl it come equipped wid it
She freaky deaky lick her lips wid it, she thick thick wid it
Jump, stump, twist wid it
Make 'em, make 'em, make 'em scrap wid it
Tear da club up, champagne campaign wid it
Party people do your thang wid it
I get to it y'all, I get the funds then I split wid it
A natural born money maker nitty-grit wid it ha? I get rich y'all

Ha boy, I done bought D's wid dis
Big 'bout-it Benz car keys wid dis
Condos in the Cancun summer breeze wid dis
And you know, doin' good fo' sho'
I'm gettin' rich too hollerin' out Calhoun know nigga
Nickeled and dimed and did dirt for dis
Do a show and sweat up my good shirt for dis
Snap back to toast I'll have to hurt for dis
So when I get me a lil' bit I'm a wear my shit
And if I lose it, I ain't gon' cry about it
I ain't no dummy God damn it I ain't about to die about it
But fuck wid me though, I'll let a few fly about it
Don't test me boy, because I about it!
So I'm the major money maker, mother fuck these niggaz
Keep yo' eyes on amounts, accounts and some bankers
Get high, get fly, 'til you get it, gettin' by
Don't switch get krunk get drunk get rich
From the bottom to the top now it's hot; keepin' it heated
People about to see they chasin' after cash in the ass
Suckers crash on the blast from the past
Goodie Mo.B. Backbone and OutKast
Whatchu think this was, black?
Take your sorry ass watch me blow, turnin' my lyrics in the flow
This is how it go, and it go, perfect picture paintin'
Million dollar hold in the Cascade, in the shade
Well I see gon' get paid to dis, and find a wife to dis
I'm 'bout to cut, like a knife to dis
And find dat, and find dat, top top, we get rich to dis, yeah!

The Goodie they call me, they wanted a player to bust to this
I'm takin' this thing, slow slow motion just can't rush with this
We all in the family, what have we, I think we done found a freak hoe
People all in my wallet hopin' to frolic we gon' see hoe
Just hold up, you know my pockets swoll up
I'm a let you suck my dick to meet your quota
And you're fine, kinda shorter
But I made this money before you got a Toyota and Explorer
And when I'm off in the mall gettin' fresh, I'm gon' ignore ya
Look at the earrings, the gold chains, the diamonds around my neck piece
The leather suede snake Elizabeth all up on my left B
Hoe look at all these emeralds and these rubies and my gold teeth
Thinkin' a nigga spiritual tryin' to build but you don't know me
See there's more than meets the ear so we can ball that's if we chose to
Move back I'm droppin' the top and yes it's mine and gal it's new too
Sign yo' grill wid dis
Canary yellow bowlin' ball silk drawers wid dis
Crushed velvet diamond cut, y'all get wreck wid dis
Tonight, Gipp get woozy
Might step outside and might catch me a floozie
Some loozy double-stitched hoochie
Y'all chase records while we chase coochie
The realest Down South hot two, in your face like kabuki
Get krunk, don't be no lame brain top bank head
Props, I'm prayin' wid dis
Boys on the ave, flood shots to dis
Girls in the club flirt out to dis
State your name baby and get rich to dis
