[Chorus]
We're having a good day
Let's make it a great night
You know I see you
And .. so tight
My special lady
You're one of a kind
And every time I see you shine
It's like the lights of midnight
On New Year's Eve
And I do believe
On New Year's Eve
We can make it
We can live forever
11:59 and not a second later
She's stayin' in the mix like a crossfader
It's about to go down
No elevator
Live for the moment
Love in the air
She got me feeling like
I don't wanna be your player
Real talk
So I don't wanna be unfair
Now watch the apple drop
And celebrate the year
I see you shinin' away
From over there
And all the other girls
No, they don't compare
I whisper something bond to you
.. in your ear
I infiltrate your mind
And then I penetrate her
I get it crackin' baby
Call me the ... lady
[Chorus]
We're having a good day
Let's make it a great night
You know I see you
And .. so tight
My special lady
You're one of a kind
And every time I see you shine
It's like the lights of midnight
On New Year's Eve
And I do believe
On New Year's Eve
We can make it
We can live forever
Grab a glass
Make a toast to the good life
Recorded line, so what?
It will pass the time
Leather seats in the back of a Phantom ride
You stay on my mind so I had to make you mine
Master .. for a master mind
My special lady
Only one of a kind
I never seen it comin'
I guess love is blind
New Year ... come to life
I must say girl
You're looking right
Your hair, nails, dress
Fitting tight
I think I just might
Says here's the one I like
See we can look forever girl
Let's be .. tonight
[Chorus]
We're having a good day
Let's make it a great night
You know I see you
And .. so tight
My special lady
You're one of a kind
And every time I see you shine
It's like the lights of midnight
On New Year's Eve
And I do believe
On New Year's Eve
We can make it
We can live forever
