Luda!
Yep!
S.G.!
Chris Breezy !
It's me!
Hey!
Uh oh!
U-uh u-uh, uh oh!
U-uh u-uh!
I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls
I know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like
I know what they feel 'cause I'm breathin' on they heels
And it's me they wanna kill 'cause I give 'em what the girls like
I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls
I know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like
I know what they feel 'cause I'm breathin' on they heels
And it's me they wanna kill 'cause I give 'em what the girls like
Relax and take notes while I put you up on game
Get a sweeter connect than if I put you up on cane
But you should grab yourself a seat and a whiskey double
Because the girls of the world ain't nothin' but trouble
They like a little danger, they might not admit it
But they on for the chase and they want us to come and get it
Plus they love a young thug that's overflowin' with swag
And keeps his woman all draped in new Louis Vuitton bags
And Louis Vuitton pumps, look at her walk to 'em
I like open toe straps, but SG talk to 'em!
I got a whole buncha girls I'm tryna bring by the crib tonight
Better wear your cape 'cause they bringin' that kryptonite
I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls
I know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like
I know what they feel 'cause I'm breathin' on they heels
And it's me they wanna kill 'cause I give 'em what the girls like
I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls
I know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like
  (I know what you like baby!)
I know what they feel 'cause I'm breathin' on they heels
And it's me they wanna kill 'cause I give 'em what the girls like
  (Yeah! we gon' take this to verse two)
Now some of 'em want a family, a sense of security
Necklace, bracelets and all other types of jewelry
So shop till you drop or till it makes you psychotic
Here's a Triple Black Card, it ain't trickin' if you got it!
Others will stay content if you just makin' 'em laugh
Send 'em to the spa, get a massage then bubble bath
So later on, they can dance and throw a drink in they hand
And try any and everything they never did with they man, me!
So get loose and slide off your damn garments
Show 'em who's the boss, they take orders from the sergeant
There's places on your body that I'm tryin' to find
So in the sack, talk to me, tell me what's on your mind
And I got plenty more to learn if you's invested in me
They don't love me for who I am but who I'm destined to be
And for that I'll give you everything up under the sun
'Cause in the end all the girls just wanna have fun!
I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls
I know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like
I know what they feel 'cause I'm breathin' on they heels
And it's me they wanna kill 'cause I give 'em what the girls like
  (I know what you feel, yes!)
I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls
I know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like
I know what they feel 'cause I'm breathin' on they heels
And it's me they wanna kill 'cause I give 'em what the girls like
They wanna talk to ya, so shut up and listen!
If you can't take the heat, then get the fuck out the kitchen!
'Cause a ride-or-die man for his ride-or-die chick
Gets that ride-or-die puddin' for that ride-or-die stick
I say they wanna talk to ya, so shut up and listen!
If you can't take the heat, then get the fuck out the kitchen!
'Cause a ride-or-die man for his ride-or-die chick
Gets that ride-or-die puddin' for that ride-or-die stick
I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls
I know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like
I know what they feel 'cause I'm breathin' on they heels
And it's me they wanna kill 'cause I give 'em what the girls like
  (They wanna go on vacation, I know it! Let's go!)
I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls
I know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like
I know what they feel 'cause I'm breathin' on they heels
  (Yes! They want what they can't have, ha ha, yeah!)
And it's me they wanna kill 'cause I give 'em what the girls like
Women, I love y'all, ha ha, there's not enough time, believe that
And if your man don't tell you every day how beautiful you are
I'm lettin' ya know right damn now, you are beautiful baby
I love women so much, I have one! Woo! Ha ha ha
Luda! Chris Breezy! This too easy
SG, what up! Ha ha, woo!
