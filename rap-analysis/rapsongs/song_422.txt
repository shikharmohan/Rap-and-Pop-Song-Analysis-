[Chorus: Krayzie Bone] (X2)
You need some reefer we smokin' the Bombay,
You need some liquor we pourin' it all day,
Lookin' for drama my niggas be wildin',
Hey, fuck, hey, fuck, hey, fuck, hey, fuck hey.
[Verse One: Krayzie Bone]
Guess who just stepped in the club,
Them niggas that don't give a thuggish ruggish mothafuck,
We come to party; some of my partners come to fuck it up,
Stuff em, turn the fuckin' music up,
Get it crunk, nigga what,
Fill up on my niggas cup,
Watch out for security, cause we bout to blaze the doob up,
Let's smoke and burn, choke the herb,
So come on ride the train, you should ride it,
Make sure you bring your Mary Jane, and personal lighter,
We keep that fire, fire; baby, baby,
Krayzie, faded, we blaze shit all day,
When we rumble, (uh oh)
We just like animals out the jungle,
Make em fall, collapse, stumble, and fumble, just like drunk hoes.
[Chorus] (X2)
[Verse Two: Layzie Bone:]
Biz got the extra green and nicotine and Krayzie off that sin,
Me and Wish just got to the club and man they better let us in,
Cause we got cheese to spend and I know they really don't want no trouble,
My heat get double double or we got get on a hustle,
And it ain't no party like a Bone Thug party, cause a Bone Thug party get wild,
Get foul in the crowd like do that what? Do that shit right now,
We the same damn niggas, sellin yayo, sippin 40s,
Wearin khakis with the timbs' on, mothafuckas know the story,
We can't leave rap alone, the game need us,
Think you can handle us or beat us, come on, Cleatus!
Mess up that drank you drankin,
Puff on that weed you smokin,
My niggas ain't never jokin,
And I came to get you open off this weed, weed, weed, weed...
[Chorus] (X2)
[Verse Three: Bizzy Bone/Wish Bone]
[Bizzy]
Coke & Henny and I'm feelin irie,
Wanna try me, pussy nigga die, we
Slide up in the club, ready, collide
Wanna get wild, hey, highly
Intoxicated, Fucked up that firy,
Dirty rotten,
Glock in the block, and please believe it,
Watchin you niggas, Oh Jesus!
What is the secret, what is the reason,
Clutchin my metal trinkets,
Wish bring the pain for these niggas,
Please believe itÃ¢Â¦
[Wish]
I'm a drink, I'm a smoke,
When I hit the club I'm in the back door,
We 'dem no problems,
But if you want em we can dance, ho,
Higher, higher, put a little Henn in that Cris,
It'll make you righter nicer,
Drunk as fuck but don't get it twisted,
I will light cha, fight cha,
In the middle of the party,
With a hundred thugs right by me,
And you don't wanna try me!
What I got to lose?
And I'm mad as fuck Imma run 'em out they shoes, move
Bring your own smoke,
And your own drink, that's Thug's rules, foo!
[Chorus] (X4)
