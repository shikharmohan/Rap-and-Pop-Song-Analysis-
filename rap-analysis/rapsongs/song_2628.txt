Ill nana
Yeah, whoa whoa
Black king, whoa
B.k, whoa whoa
1, 2, 3, 4
I'm good, buckle up
Cause you know we about to go
Take a trip to a place
Somewhere like outer space
Don't be scared
I'm the captain anything can happen to ya boy
But I won't hurt cha boy.
[VERSE 1:]
My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard
Do the fuckin thing like a porno star
Me and my girls real hard in the Bentley Arnage
In a whife line skirt and chinchilla fur
My bitch Tiff keep a bottle of Cris
In a glass top six and that's my bitch
F double O. X. B. double O. G. I. E
My na na na tastes like Jamaican kiki
Ain't a bitch freaky like me 
When the lights go out I'mma show you what I'm 'bout
Matter fact playboy open you mouth (come here)
Lemme take you on a tour down south.
[CHORUS:]
Baby when the lights go out, I want cha to show me what you're all about.
Baby when the lights go out I'm gonna light up your life
Take you for a ride on this rollercoaster
Theme park, thrill ride, Main attraction let's ride (lets fly)
Baby when the lights go out 
I'm gonna light up your life 
Take you for a ride on this rollercoaster
[VERSE 2:]
I only met one nigga that deserved it
And he a gangsta so he worth it 
I make them pretty boys nervous
Ya'll already know who this is
The bitch that will throw it back vicious
I like it rough
I ain't them other rap bitches
I throw it up in mad positions
From the bathroom to the kitchen
On the table fuck the dishes
They fall to the floor 
While I give you the business
See I'm so flexible, I'll stretch and pull that ass up real properly 
Can't with the ill na na
Can't with the ill na na 
Can't with the ill na na 
1, 2, 3, 4 
[CHORUS:]
Baby when the lights go out, I want cha to show me what you're all all about
Baby when the lights go out I'm gonna light up your life
Take you for a ride on this rollercoaster
Theme park, thrill ride, Main attraction let's ride (lets fly)
Baby when the lights go out 
I'm gonna light up your life 
Take you for a ride on the rollercoaster
[VERSE 2:]
The boy can't handle the na na 
Let him put one hand on the na na
Then I'll let him get a sniff of the na na
The boy came too quick for the na na
Then I'll let him get a lick of the na na
Blood Claat boy get stiff for the na na
See my pun-pun print through the pallets
Something like the black medallion bein worth it.
[BRIDGE:]
Boy relax your mind it will be alright
Just hold and open your eyes
'Til Lights go out cause imma light up your life
So what you gonna do.
[CHORUS:]
Baby when the lights go out 
I want cha (I want cha) to show me (to show me) what you're all about
Baby when the lights go out I'm gonna light up your life
Take you for a ride on this rollercoaster
Theme park, thrill ride, main attraction let's ride (lets fly)
Baby when the lights go out 
I'm gonna light up your life 
Take you for a ride on the rollercoaster
