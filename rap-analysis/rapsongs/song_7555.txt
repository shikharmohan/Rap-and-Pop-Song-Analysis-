[Shawty Redd]
Lady's and gentlemen.
Homies and Homets.
I would like to introduce you to a young man we all grown to love, and that motivates the thugs.
He just put a little CD out right now.
If you a real N***** you'll ride to it
Yo Young you ready? I'm about to put you on blast.
[Young Jeezy]
Verse 1:
So you know it don't stop, so you know it don't quit.
Better get your money cause these hoes ain't  ****.
Gotta run me at the mall, yea you know how it get.
F*** around spend ya lease on the whole outfit.
Might see me out cause you know I like to party.
Self made N***** I don't want nobody.
See my name Young Jizzle, I don't want nobody
Got something in my safe, I ain't showing nobody.
Sucka's still hating but you know I don't care.
Real N***** with me put your hands in the air.
Better show respect when your f***ing with a player.
Now you riding around the city like your f***ing with the mayor.
[Chorus]
So you know it don't stop. [You know it don't stop]
So you know it don't quit. [You know it don't quit]

If the music keeps you rocking, and the bottles keep on popping girl don't worry bout the time, girl you fine.
We got champagne on the rocks and all my ladies looking at you, know the party just wont  stop til we say. [Oh, Oh, Oh]

Verse 2:
She wants to buy new shoes and a new bag.
She can call her home girls up, straight brag.
And If you got it like that then you go girl.
Keep doing what your doing s*** its your world.
Not me, you know I'm on to the next girl.
You know how people balled up like an S-Curl.
Put some miles on that thing like an S-Type.
When I'm going off the goose lay the best pipe.
Had the Lexus back then baby white pearl.
All that yea thanks to that white girl. 
Said white pearl, s*** I meant pearl white.
All you n***** talking slick know its on sight.
Meanwhile see Jizzle off the shed trails. 
With a bad red ball bitch like Chanel.
Got so many gotta name it by the bag whole.
Bet you one thing about it, ???? bad dough.
[Chorus]
