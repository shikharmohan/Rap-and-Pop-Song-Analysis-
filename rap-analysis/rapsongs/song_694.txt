Musty fusty yet so crystal clear
The non-commercial set is now here
Brought to you by the will of positve people
K-r-s plus one equals
Slammin' lyrics and beats unquestionable
The peofessional while I guess that you'll
Grab the album that rocks most on the market
Strong hearted with a target
--bloo-- and the target is hit
I shot the lyric then reload the clip
--bloo-- another shell hits the ground
Along with the shell my opponents weak crown
--bloo bloo-- the title comes after
What a disaster listen to the laughter
Your heart I capture
Cause every lecture has tecture
If you're wack I say next sir
Who's next cause I've got no time for weakness
Only the teacher speaks this
Dialect, which gains nuff resect
Which money can't buy you yet
I don't care cause boogie down productions has both
The most worldwide coast to coast
We didn't do it with the soft commercial sound
Try the ghetto cause I refuse to let go
You see you don't understand I knew it
You got a copy I read from the blueprint
Keepin' it on track
And never wack
Please step back
If you speak the weak rap
Cause I alone can dis your whole pack or posse
Stupid sit there and watch me
You can't stop the original with a copy
Sloppy very sloppy you slouch
Every time I bite you yell ouch
Breakout get lost your throat is hoarse
You lost cause I'm dope of course
--one and two and three and four--
But that comes from years of practice
Anti-slackness anti-wackness
Throw on the glasses and teach the masses
Very simple the question I ask is
How many mcs must get stomped
Before somebody says kris has no calm
Thousands both here and overseas
If you're soft I say please leave
Here's the door here's your hat coat and mitt
Cause here we read from the blueprint
