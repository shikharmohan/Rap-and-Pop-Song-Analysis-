Get numbers, get names, thick dames
Headhunters get brains, big thangs
Give niggas shit stains, the shit, man
And don't you forget, man
We be the best of CG
Greedy, abduct the PD
See me, nigga, not in 3D
Be me, hah, it's not easy
I'm breezy and off the Heezy
Me and my woman's like George and Wheezy
Movin' on up, niggas used to tease me
See me on top, it makes you queasy
Sick with it, bitch, I'm Bruce Lee
Seduce me, you're nice and juicy
In the parking lot, I gots to get mine
Why the fuck we goin' in when there's bitches in line?
I spend my time watchin' bitches' behind
Thinkin' bad shit in the back of my mind
I bump and grind with nothing less than a dime
Making movie money, you still investin' in rhymes
And I'm in this bitch
With a hundred dollar bill, ya'll
About to spend this bitch
I'm in this bitch
I got a hundred dollar bill, ya'll
About to spend this bitch
I'm in this bitch
Who got a hundred dollar bill, ya'll?
About to spend this bitch
I'm in this bitch
I got a hundred dollar bill, ya'll
About to spend this bitch
I'm in here, got all you freaks lookin'
When we walk by, pussy start cookin'
Rookies start tookin'
Get your ass up, V.I.P. section's gettin' tooken
Might dance, might not, might spend enough
Cool as hell but still pipin' hot
Soon as I find a spot, all my people gather 'round
The nigga with the shiny, watch me
Ice Cube, motherfucker
Next to me, you a test tube motherfucker
We kinda rude, motherfucker
Get too close and bucka, bucka, bucka
Don't want no problems, ya'll
Fuck around, I'll pull out the problem solved
And watch E pills dissolve
Nine times out of ten, you hoes involved
And I'm in this bitch
With a hundred dollar bill, ya'll
About to spend this bitch
I'm in this bitch
I got a hundred dollar bill, ya'll
About to spend this bitch
I'm in this bitch
Who got a hundred dollar bill, ya'll?
About to spend this bitch
I'm in this bitch
I got a hundred dollar bill, ya'll
About to spend this bitch
Get numbers, get names, thick dames
Headhunters get brains, big thangs
Give niggas shit stains, the shit, man
And don't you forget, man
Security pat downs, I'm a star, motherfucker
I been put' the gat down, I been put the mack down
But check the people that I'm with
'Cause they'll lay you flat down
And they'll do it right now
Yeah, you scared of the phone numbers that a nigga might dial
Club-hop, car shows, picnics
Big cars, big jewels, big dicks
Rush doors or gotta hop the fence
Blow this door, gotta blow my rent
Gotta show my ass, then go repent
Gotta call in sick and tell 'em where I went
And I'm in this bitch
With a hundred dollar bill, ya'll
About to spend this bitch
I'm in this bitch
I got a hundred dollar bill, ya'll
About to spend this bitch
I'm in this bitch
Who got a hundred dollar bill, ya'll?
About to spend this bitch
I'm in this bitch
I got a hundred dollar bill, ya'll
About to spend this bitch
You know, you know
You know, you know
I got a hundred dollar bill, ya'll
