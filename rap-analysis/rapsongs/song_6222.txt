I'm like row, row, like I have cerebral palsy
My flows bes wet loke all you girls draws be
Crack the dils, spread the buddah in the hid douse
Roll it up and diddas, who tipped in for the 10 bag
Etcetera, I roll my blunts with two textures
Pick up 50 bags and then I smoke all the extras
It's the truth, like funk 180 proof
Don't drop your draws, I'll fuck through your daisy dukes
(True)
Put your fingers up in the air if your high
I walk by, so f-in' dry
I swing up in it 'bout an average as half as
Good as Reggie Jackson's, that's why you talk backwards
And toch bills and bogard shit like Humphrey
You couldn't beat me if you ran with 21 jump street
Or 90210, fuck it yo
In the movies, I'm the nigga puffin' buddah in the back row
I can't wait to get it on, I can't wait to get it on
I can't wait to get it on, I can't wait to get it on
I can't wait to get it on, I can't wait to get it on
I can't wait to get it on, I can't wait to get it on
I'm just a smoky boy, I'm from the land of the lost
You can't see me like Charlie Angel's boss
I'm often coolin' round the bliddocks
I rock 'round the cliddocks
Mmy gliddock cocked from here to 16 for liddocks
I tried to tomas if I'm gettin' scopic
I was built like two tits but now I'm butter like blue bonnet
Now, who got the funk, we got the funk
Ayo, I got the weed, we got the blunt
I never spliff, I used to puff buddahs in the jail
Back in 88 when it was 20 cidic grand
(Rizzam)
You couldn't read me in braild, hell
I write my names on walls in smole spots when I'm buyin'
I, the fly guy with force like luke sky
Down for 8 ball see twa bitch if you fly
The funkadelic been rockin' mics since the fourth grade
I terminate like X and I terminate like Schwartzanage
Dum, ti, dum rock like Buju Banton
Soup like won ton, fuck by the ton, ja bumps
Please, my whole crew's wakin G's
Tonight's the night baby so suck up on these and it's on
I said, I catch the a train to the luv, smoke the junk
I set shit off like bobofet
Big up to all my niggas in the housing projects
I'm runnin' up in your contingents and split your guts, round and round
If you get scared of my lines when I rock well
Got whits like purnell, shits the bomb like akenelle
Rikity, rockit, mindy best to knock this
Waste niggas like toxic, wet like galoshes
Can I handle my biz? Yes, you can
I cause kaos and bring a lot of def to jams
Yes, I can, now ask to get out
Pop the trunk cla clunk and give me your babump, babump
Ooh, cool, smooth like two blue suede shoes
Y'all faggots stepped on my huffman and koos
Word to dan, tan, pillow, and cool b
Switchin' speeds like Bruce Lee ridin' up Fuji in a movie
I drop on the one, fuck the two, three
Funky like a box of coochies on looseleaf
Yo, yo, did you hear that? Yo, I be sayin' some shit
Switchin' up speeds like Bruce Lee, ridin' up Fuji, in a movie
Now, if you didn't get it lock down
And figure that shit out when you get home
