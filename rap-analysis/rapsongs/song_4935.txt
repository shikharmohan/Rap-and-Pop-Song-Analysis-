Yea-uh, here we go, here we go, here we go
Talk about that word of Mouf baby
Yeuh, yeuh yeuh yeuh yeuh! Here we go, here we go
Ludacris, 4-Ize, D E what you want now now now now
Check it
You see I live a life filled with chicken and Malt Liquor
And women that are real life scratch 'n' sniff stickers
I shoot videos and get knobs slobbed in trailers
Then hit stage and break a leg like Lawrence Taylor
You pricks is all talk, and it's bad for ya health
See I ain't gotta say shit, the money speaks for itself
With all models I make I'm great like five lakes
You got rims on ya truck? Man I got rims in my skates
You rollin' on dubs, I roll right into clubs
Dirtiest home with more rings than ya tub
You think it's all practical jokes and big bloopers
But I smack bitches with no titties that work at Hooters
Just get a couple of girls that shakin' they thangs
Then I, put 'em on camera and cut two frames
With some gasoline drawers I'll be goin' to Hell
Ludacris, fuck like a nigga fresh out of jail
I got junkyard dawgs, I'm rowdier than Rod Piper
And my baby's assed out, 'cause I rub my cars with her diapers
So you can pray for now if you sinned in the past
"Word of Mouf" time to wipe that silly grin off yo' ass
These rap cats is soft like R 'n' B singers
It's 4-Ize, I've worked for wings and chicken fingers
I reps mo' parts so Chi-town could get seen
I'm a dirty bird now but I keep shit clean
I rip meanface niggaz one by one
Or two by two, I'll take 'em however they come
Instead of a gun, I'll pull out a stick from woodworkin'
The black hacksaw Jim Duggin stay lurkin'
Creepin', I'm in the shadows, the nightshade
You want the tail in the back or, a light fade?
'Cause Tony Scissorhands is the barber, the butcher
I kill ya smoke a blunt and forget where I put ya
I'm soopafly like Snuka, I smack hoes
The black rose with the dozen attack flows
I rock Shaq's clothes when I alter beast
Power up, get big, it's disturbin' the peace
