Ice Cube, Ice Cube
That's Don Mega to you, you cocksucker
I am the angel of death
And your name is on my list
Sheeyit
Come with me
I ain't goin' nowhere wit yo' ass
And if you put your hands on me
We gettin' down right here
Don Mega, Don Mega
Join the party, I can provide the army
Join the party, I can provide the army
Join the party, I can provide the army
Join the party, I can provide the army
Come and hear the voice of the man they call the Trojan Horse
Ride on the outside with inner force
Throw you off course, of course, you missed the runway
We mash, like the first kickoff on a Sunday
Collisions, divisions of niggaz, down to listen
And when we on the mission, call your mortician
Join the party, I can provide the army
First we flank 'em then we spank 'em, I outrank 'em
You can call me Citizen Kane for my reign
Ten years great, one of the ten great
Mr. Media, look inside your encyclopedia
2002, see Ice Cube
Fuck a five-star, I'm a live star
What you got to die for?
Who you wanna ride for?
Fuck dying, fuck dying
Don Mega, Don Mega
It's the suspect king of the roughnecks, bonafide
Worldwide, your highness, the finest
Big as China, nigga rhymer, chart climber
Quick to send a first-timer back to his aunt Jemimah
Physical, nigga roll with the winners
After these dinners, go out and represent us
We got antennas, scanners and satellites
To see if you battle right, we got to bite
Hold on tight, shake and pump venom
Some haters don't learn till you leave lead in 'em
See the dead in 'em, rigarmortis spread in 'em
Keep your mouth shut, motherfuckin' mouth slug
See these crossed legs, quick to cross Feds
Foe to mighty one, it's the mighty son
Fuck dying
Don Mega, Don Mega, Don Mega
Join the party, I can provide the army
Join the party, I can provide the army
Join the party, I can provide the army
Join the party, I can provide the army
Fuck dying, I can provide the army
Fuck dying, I can provide the army
Fuck dying, I can provide the army
Fuck dying, I can provide the army
In the ghetto, in the ghetto
In the city, the suburbs, penitentiary
In the county
Fuck dying, fuck dying
Join the party, I can provide the army
Join the party, I can provide the army
Join the party, I can provide the army
Join the party, I can provide the army
I can provide the army
I can provide the army
I can provide the army
I can provide the army
Eternal life, baby
Eternal life, eternal life
Hear ye, hear ye
All connect gang members and powers
Are to meet at the west wing
To be led into battle by the one and only
