L-Y-R to the I-C-S
Niggaz still fussin' bout who be the best
When diggy-dawg bounce too I put all that to rest
Anyone try test I put two in they chest
Quest or no Quest I leave venues a mess
Don't ask me to collab me and you don't mess(mix?)
I stay fresh from the fresh never front nor 'fess
In the name of J. Christ all mic's'll get blessed
P: power possess flavor, style, finesse
Microphone honeys two things I caress
To all you fake Jiggy-niggaz, STILL not impressed
Queens: I rep it to the fully, you'll think I own the Mets
