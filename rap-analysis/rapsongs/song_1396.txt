Uh, any chance I get I'm on a plane
I book advance tickets and pay the fees with no complaints
In the summer it's off the hook, no time to waste
Just lie at the lake and I'm shoulder dry to the taste
Even though some niggas I grew up with, hate
I keep a few good homies to try to stay outta jail
Tonio tell me what the bail is, it'll be there
And when you get out my coke tail here
The crack head deals in my daddy
And all he seem to dream about is bad ass habits
The gun shots scream loud
So I soak the radio from upstairs to outside the house
With the extension to cord no night is ever boring
On the front porch even if its pouring
In the summer, winter, fall, or spring
I love it when my bitches and my ballers sing
Chi town, Chi town the city where I'm from
As a kid to who I become live to get what I want
Chi town, the city with the best skyline
Born there that's home there in my lifetime
Chicago show them how we do
The best place some hate but they still come through
Chi town, the city with the best skyline
Born there that's home there in my lifetime
The liquor store on every corner packed
The bus run twenty-fo and my stop Jackson
Fire hydrant busted time for action
Niggas come out like its the beach in Miami
The cops chase thief's all through the alley and don't stop
These niggas kill for rocks
If you can't stand up for your spot, don't squat
Shop for a vacant lot or get shot
'Cuz Chicago niggas don't play them games
When it comes to slanging them thangs for the money mane
Fuck around and get short for the playas ball
And call Don Juan to flash green on you all
The pimps got the hoes pinned up on the wall
Just pass me the blunt and I puff it all
In the summer, winter, fall, or spring
I love it when my bitches and my ballers sing
Chi town, Chi town the city where I'm from
As a kid to who I become live to get what I want
Chi town, the city with the best skyline
Born there that's home there in my lifetime
Chicago show them how we do
The best place some hate but they still come through
Chi town, the city with the best skyline
Born there that's home there in my lifetime
Don't worry about what I do for my city
Some of y'all run your mouth too much and what a pity
If you outside looking in, shit seem pretty
But its a lot of shit to do with bitch, I did it
I'm cold in the winter my mink track the flow
With the hat to match, Cadillacs in the snow
If its a block party, the whole hood know
Niggas from 3 and 1st streets overcome the smoke
It's K-Town times 22 next to shine
Who label he on mine Westside nigga right
To my Southside niggas and my Eastside niggas
And my Northside niggas, get high
We really don't give a fuck what side you from
Just keep on hollering out Chi!
In the summer, winter, fall, or spring
I love it when my bitches and my ballers sing
Chi town, Chi town the city where I'm from
As a kid to who I become live to get what I want
Chi town, the city with the best skyline
Born there that's home there in my lifetime
Chicago show them how we do
The best place some hate but they still come through
Chi town, the city with the best skyline
Born there that's home there in my lifetime
Chi town, Chi town the city where I'm from
As a kid to who I become live to get what I want
Chi town, the city with the best skyline
Born there that's home there in my lifetime
Chicago show them how we do
The best place some hate but they still come through
Chi town, the city with the best skyline
Born there that's home there in my lifetime
