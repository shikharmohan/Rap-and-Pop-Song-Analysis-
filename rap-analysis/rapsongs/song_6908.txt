Last night!
[a-plus]
Was incredible, unforgetable
Seen some ass mc's
Had to let'em know
Last night!
[tajai]
Had put my thang down
Got my thang on
Did my thug thang
It wasn't a thang wrong
Last night!
[opio]
I thought it was just my mic level
I can't hear myself & plus turn up the echo
Last night!
[phesto dee]
I took a five hour plane flight
Spittin' at my homegirl via satellite
Last night!
[a-plus]
Idea was top the secret
And you wouldn't belive it unless you peeped it
She was off the chain, all-terrain
All insane alcohol stalled her brain
Last night I caught the right weed
Had my body slow-mo but thoughts at light speed (last night!)
Was a long one I was on one, a strong one
Smoke it 'til it's all done
Last night!
[opio]
We out we out we out
Forty miles over the speed limit
On target like a bullet to the knees
From the swat team when i'm
Shootin' these in 'em
Trigger kamikaze but two shots are hidden then
Step into the station (pass a-plea the venom)
So we can take a sip and let the poison get in 'em
Ink off the mic like a vortex without a bitch or a lex
I get more affection
Payin' no attention cause I learned my lesson
Cold hearted bitterness so I never sweat them (last night!)
Starstruck the hollywood hoes in action
Master your high watch out they backstabbin'
Last night!
[phesto dee]
Chillin' where the city lights flash bright
Burning rubber in a riddle livin' in the fast life
That's right
I saw the last of my id's
One too many a dem long island ice teas
Act right
You thought you was the life of the party
Feelin' light hearted off the lime and bacardi (last night!)
I seen your girl at a red light
Too conditioned for your highness but we did it all night
Last night!
[tajai]
Last night I spend my whole night out
Met some hoes outta fest for low riders
Mind hunters, lip gloss shine & hypnotizin' minor men
And like a fool I invite 'em into my ride
When we was already high but with tequila sunrises
Jack & mai tais
It was all over
Wished I stayed sober cause I don't know what
Happened and niggas keep on laughing (last night!)
Oh that's right
You was poppin' at the cutie with the big backside
Last night!
[a-plus]
Yeah I was watchin' movies on my sofa
Knowin' susie'd soon be comin' over
Last night!
[phesto dee]
I cracked a cold one
Then I smoked some but lost a whole bunch
Last night!
[opio]
We lit up the premium blend
Hit it again and again and make the world spin
Last night!
[phesto dee]
I rolled across the golden gate bridge
Headed for the o with pep and jay-biz
Last night!
[opio]
I got paid before and laid after
(up in? ) the mic and broke bread at the tabernacle
Last night!
[a-plus]
I'm sleepin' from drinkin' too early in the evenin'
And hennessy had me hurlin' and heavin'
Last night!
[tajai]
Last night I broke on through to that side
Party til my body capsized
Last night!
[phesto dee]
I saw the (locs plus it's off the tushes? )
Lookin' voluptuous in capri's and petal pushers
Hair brushes had us watchin' for the black and whites
Evadin' the sobriety checks and spotlights
Last night!
[a-plus]
I smoked a bomb sack facial
Then I got a call from this girl I hate bro (what? )
She said I'm comin' by don't think that I'm a h-o
I'm thinkin' how you know I was on the eighth floor? 
Last night!
[tajai]
Last night was scorchin', blazin'
An overload of endorphins
This motorola is just torchin'
Act like I be actin' brazen
A'k the ladies
I may push it but don't force it
Last night!
[opio]
This way configurate when we skate in a caravan
Kickin' up dust and disappear in a sand storm
Mash on the gas aim direct and escape
To the next experience we do it heavyweight
Lat night!
[a-plus]
Got pulled over by the po-pers
Wasn't sober they let me go but they took all of my dosia
Last night!
[phesto dee]
We was compact deep in the backseat
Goin' tone deaf from distorted fifteens
Last night!
[opio]
Check it out they was movin' too slow
I was in the fast lane with the cruise control
Last night!
[tajai]
If you missed us catch us next time we ride
'cause you know we do it right
Last night!
