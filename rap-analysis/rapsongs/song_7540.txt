This one for the hood right here
Song dedicated anybody out there that got some dreams
Don't give up on your dreams real talk
Ready kids, let's go
Dreamin', yeah, dreamin', yeah
Dreamin', dreamin', yeah
Dreamin', yeah, dreamin', yeah
Born September 28, my life far from great
No food on the table, so we far from steak
But I'm so close to jail, it feels like I'm so close to hell
Mom's smoking ***, same s*** I'm selling
So who's wrong, her or me
She addicted to the high, I'm addicted to the cash
I almost put my hands on her when I caught her in my stash
How could I do her like that, Lord knows I'm wrong
Why would I do her like that, Lord know she's strong
I know it's been hard but we made it baby
Ten years clean, so she's still my lady, I must be dreamin'
Dreamin', I must think about it
Man I must be dreamin'
I must think about it, dreamin'
Dreamin', I must think about it
Man I must be dreamin'
I must think about it, dreamin', dreamin'
One thing about it, I got love for you hommie
Two things about it, I'll take a slug for you hommie
Look at you now your a business man
I'm proud of you dog, handle your business man
You like tha brother, I never ever had
You try your best and I still get mad
We risked it all together, been through it all together
Caught cases and we're still together
Headed OG, I sleep while you drive
Me and my dog  yeah, we're chippin' on fire
Remember back when we shared our clothes
Look at us now *** we sell out shows, I must be dreamin'
Dreamin', I must think about it
Man I must be dreamin'
I must think about it, dreamin'
Dreamin', I must think about it
Man I must be dreamin'
I must think about it, dreamin'
I was young and dumb wit a pocket full of cash
Posted on tha block wit a pocket full of glass
Full speed, still runnin' from my past
But it's starting to catch up, yeah, it's gaining on my a**
There's two types of *** predator and prey
I'm a predator, I pray 3 times a day
Mat Lue once said one day you'll have kids
And how you gon' explain all that *** you did
I'm a soul survivor far from a crook
She always said I was a lot smarter than I look
So I took my dreams and made it some thousands
Then I took my life and made it an album, I must be dreamin'
Dreamin', I must think about it
Man I must be dreamin'
I must think about it, dreamin'
Dreamin', I must think about it
Man I must be dreamin'
I must think about it, dreamin'
Dreamin', I must think about it
Man I must be dreamin'
I must think about it, dreamin'
Dreamin', I must think about it
Man I must be dreamin'
I must think about it, dreamin'
Dreamin', I must think about it
Man I must be dreamin'
I must think about it, dreamin'
Dreamin', I must think about it
Man I must be dreamin'
