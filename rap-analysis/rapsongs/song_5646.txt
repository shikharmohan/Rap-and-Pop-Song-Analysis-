[Prodigy talking]
Don't stop, ya heard (Mobb Niggaz...)
Fuck that nigga's story...
Everday, all day, all night (it's goin down, right now)
all mornin (Mobb Niggaz...) all afternoon
We here nigga (right now, we tired of waitin)
Yo fuck the face, bitch-ass nigga (Mobb Niggaz...)
Tell you niggaz somethin (get up on that nigga son)
The fuck you niggaz wanna do? (Mobb Niggaz...)
[Chorus: Prodigy]
They call me the P nigga, we Infamous Mobb nigga
We could only get bigger (Mobb Niggaz...)
We the number one team, we the ghetto all streets
And we prey on the weak (Mobb Niggaz...)
Y'all can't come close at all, our clips is tall
Enough shots to kill all y'all (Mobb Niggaz...)
We that M-O-B-B, don't move nigga freeze
You get kill't with ease (Mobb Niggaz...)
[Gambino]
I can do what I wanna do, take what I wanna take
Get who I gotta get, it's nothing
'cause my guns is bustin, kid you gotta respect the game
I talk "Reality Rap" so you know I keep that thang
That make ya ears ring - so watch ya step, or wear a vest
'cause Infamous'll cave in ya chest, demand the respect
Vexed sweatin, loadin the tec
Thinkin about all the foul shit you brought to the set
I'm hit you and ya man, whoever is next
'cause right now the grimy one ain't gettin no checks
How you think that make me feel when I got two kids
Plus takin care of my brother 'cause my dunn ain't here
I'm tired of the tears, drippin down my moms face
I'm tired of tellin my dawgs, we gon' make it one day
It's now or never, and I ain't got no patience to wait
'cause it's too much drug money to get outta state
[Chorus: Prodigy]
They call him Gambino nigga, we Infamous Mobb nigga
We could only get bigger (Mobb Niggaz...)
We the number one team, we the ghetto all streets
And we prey on the weak (Mobb Niggaz...)
Y'all can't come close at all, our clips is tall
Enough shots to kill all y'all (Mobb Niggaz...)
We that M-O-B-B, don't move nigga freeze
You get kill't with ease (uh-huh)
[Ty nitty]
Aiyyo in God we trust, united we stand, together we fall
We Mobb Niggaz and we here to brawl, and rob niggaz
and see who heart is bigger - mines our yours
Who think quicker? Thems or us
We can't be contained, aiyyo y'all young'ns maintain
Y'all the underdogs, aiyyo we headline every show
We Mobb Niggaz, throw liquor on bitches
Take pictures with the fans, and send kites to my niggaz
We that shit, we that click, aiyyo we can't be missed
Can't be dissed, smoke pounds of that good shit
Feel my click or feel this clip
Aiyyo I'm all about my figgaz, 'cause we some straight (Mobb Niggaz...)
[Chorus: Prodigy]
They call him Ty Knitty nigga, we Infamous Mobb nigga
We could only get bigger (Mobb Niggaz...)
We the number one team, we the ghetto all streets
And we prey on the weak (Mobb Niggaz...)
Y'all can't come close at all, our clips is tall
Enough shots to kill all y'all (Mobb Niggaz...)
We that M-O-B-B, don't move nigga freeze
You get kill't with ease (Mobb Niggaz...)
[Godfather]
We that M-O-B-B nigga, IM3, Infamous to the 3rd power
Gun showers to clap ya crib up crazy
My moms and the streets raised me - you owe nigga pay me
It's either or rock-a-bye baby
The guns that I got explode like M-80's
And ain't nan nigga in this rap shit can phase me
From QB to Beasley I rep Queens faithfully
The feds can't trace me, impossible to do
I'm like a high-speed pursuit, I'm ready to shoot
Gimme the loot, the cash, all the cream, and the cake
The way we shake and bake could never be fake
Y'all niggaz is flakes, the pain and the ache I feel
I'ma always be for real, until the day I'm killed
All the blood that's spilt
For every death that came before my eyes - we will survive
[Chorus: Prodigy]
And that's Godfather nigga, we Infamous Mobb nigga
We could only get bigger (Mobb Niggaz...)
We the number one team, we the ghetto all streets
And we prey on the weak (Mobb Niggaz...)
Y'all can't come close at all, our clips is tall
Enough shots to kill all y'all (Mobb Niggaz...)
We that M-O-B-B, don't move nigga freeze
You get kill't with ease (Mobb Niggaz...)
