You niggas want word play but I'm 'bout bird play
First of the month, yeah we call that bird day
Just look at 'em fly, just look at 'em fly
You niggas want word play but I'm 'bout bird play
Third the month, yeah we call that bird day
Just look at 'em fly, just look at 'em fly
I'm way too intelligent to play with my intelligence
What you tryna tell me, what I'm saying is not irrelevant?
Still represent 'cause I'ma represent
Three bands for a nine piece chicken dinner
Young bounce right back like a rubber band
Bought a whip, look y'all, no hands
Topless, stop this, where's your roof?
All this nonsense, there's no you
Married to the game, yeah we just got a load
Depending on the shipment, we might need a boat
I'm talking big money, anybody own a bank
Had to switch up the style, they was on to the tank
You niggas want word play but I'm 'bout bird play
First of the month, yeah we call that bird day
Just look at 'em fly, just look at 'em fly
You niggas want word play but I'm 'bout bird play
Third the month, yeah we call that bird day
Just look at 'em fly, just look at 'em fly
Used to bet on all hip hop, Young killed hip hop
Don't you know this dumb nigga still talking crack rocks
Got everybody following him, does that make him a leader?
Does that mean he needs to get indicted just to make you a believer
If that's the case then I really do apologize
That I memorize, that I fantasized
That I visualized, that I strategize
One false move will get your ass penalized
You can't be serious, what if Pac was hearing this?
You bull shitting me, I'm sure Biggie would agree
If he had to pass the torch then that bitch would go to me
Now wouldn't you agree it doesn't matter how he said it?
You niggas want word play but I'm 'bout bird play
First of the month, yeah we call that bird day
Just look at 'em fly, just look at 'em fly
You niggas want word play but I'm 'bout bird play
Third the month, yeah we call that bird day
Just look at 'em fly, just look at 'em fly
You ever seen a blue Rolls caught in the black grass?
Nigga, go broke and invest in a black mask
Entrepreneur, he found him a new craft
A round of applause, congratulate that nigga
'Cause when he get rich you gon' hate that nigga
I bet the haters try they best try to break that nigga
How fly? How fly?
How fly? How fly? How fly?
You niggas want word play but I'm 'bout bird play
First of the month, yeah we call that bird day
Just look at 'em fly, just look at 'em fly
You niggas want word play but I'm 'bout bird play
