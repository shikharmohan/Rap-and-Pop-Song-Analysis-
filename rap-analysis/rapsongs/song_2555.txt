It's dark in here
So follow me
I'm so scared
Your hand's so cold
No, it can't be - I'd never leave you standing there
No, it can't be - I want you here with me
And I'll be waiting
Remember me?
I'm still the same
You seem so real
You haven't changed
No, it can't be - I'm dizzy from the twist of fate
No, it can't be - I want you here with me
No, it can't be - I'd never leave you standing there
No, it can't be - I want you here with me
And I'm shaking
No, it can't be - I'd never leave you standing there
No, it can't be - I want you here
No, it can't be - I'd never, never leave you there
No, no - I'd never leave you standing there
And I'll be waiting
