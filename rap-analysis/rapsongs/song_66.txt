Ohh!
The top feel so much better than the bottom
So much better
Man you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Man you's a window shopper
In the jewelry store lookin' at **it you can't buy
Man you's a window shopper
In the dealership tryna get a test drive
Man you's a window shopper
Mad as **** when you see me ride by
Summertime, white Porsche Carrera is milky
I'm on the grind, let my paper stack but I'm filthy
It's funny how n***** get to screw facin' at me
Anyhow they ain't got the heart to get at me
I'll get down, Southside's the hood that I come from
So I don't cruise through nobody 'hood without my gun
They know the kid ain't gon' for all that bull****
Try and stick me, I'ma let off a **** ****
It ain't my fault you done f***** up your re-up
At the dice game who told you put a G up?
Everybody mad when they paper don't stack right
But when I come around y'all n***** better act right
When we got the tops down you can hear the systems thump
When we rollin', rollin', rollin'
Shut ya block down, quick to put a hole in a chump
When we rollin', rollin', rollin'
Man you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Man you's a window shopper
In the jewelry store lookin' at sh** you can't buy
Man you's a window shopper
In the dealership tryna get a test drive
Man you's a window shopper
Mad as f*** when you see me ride by
Love me in L.A. as soon as I pop in
They come to scoop me up at L.A.X. and I hop in
Now when it comes to bad ****** you know I got them
Some from Long Beach, some from Watts and from Compton
You know a n***a wanna see how Cali girls freak off
After that five hour flight from New York
I start spittin' G at a b**** like a pimp mayne
Tell her, "Meet me at the Mondrian so we can do our thang"
She can bring the lingerie with her, I suppose
Then we can go from fully dressed to just having no clothes
Then she can run and tell her best friend 'bout my sex game
Then her best friend could potentially be next, mayne
Listen mayne, **** changed, I came up I'm doin' my thang
Homey I'm holdin', holdin', holdin'
Oh sh** mayne, the store owner watchin' you
Before somethin' get stolen, stolen, stolen
Man you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Man you's a window shopper
In the jewelry store lookin' at sh** you can't buy
Man you's a window shopper
In the dealership tryna get a test drive
Man you's a window shopper
Mad as f*** when you see me ride by
