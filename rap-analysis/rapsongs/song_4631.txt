Here in 2002, we present the fabulous love joint remix
Here we have two MC's, both of which in physical form
And a producer in producarial essence
And we are coming through first with Phonte
Yo, yo, eh yo I love waking up with a supreme purpose
After a night of playin' dream merchant
Righteous way, this is a matter of extreme urgence
I love rap 'cause it seems earnest
Love this joint 'cause we reworked it
Love cell phones with free service
So I can call a broad, at E's house
And you and see, downloaded all my freestyles
On desktop, hard drop, MP3 files
Screamin' at the top of her lungs, she lovin' me now
Eh yo, Donny sang the best love ballads
A song for you and yours, make your mic fist pump valid
Late nights is a habit, drinkin' Parme, makin' matic
Jakes leave, flicks gotta have it
I love Macho Man Randy Savage
Screamin', "Elizabeth come and take a ride on my Slim Jim"
I love Barry Heter, but it tells
Just like I love Pac and Above The Rim
'Cause this ain't a fable like the Brothers Grimm
Love my niggaz Milk, Grant, Kurt, Dub, and them
Reppin' NC, we keep it bubblin', punishin'
Hate the players
I love ill doers and nay sayers
Freak broads, I'll holla later
Eh yo, we ain't tryin' to be willies or thugs in it
We just wanna spread love in it
We spread love y'all, all across the globe
We spread love all across the globe
And from the north to the south to the east to the west
Steady keepin' it locked with no stress
We spread love ya'll all across the globe
We spread love all across the globe
And now what we want to do is get down with you
Whether you're drug free or smoke a quarter pound or two
At the bar ordering another round or two
We know you like the way it sound to you
It's Big Pooh from the leather state
I love Philly's and cheese steaks
I love records when the beat breaks
I love school when the heat breaks
Fire hydrants makin' street lakes
I love 22 it feels great
Mike Tyson and his outtakes
Steppin' out with the fly date
So fans get ready for the outbreak
'Cause we gon' do it with or without papes
Even if I rhyme until my mouth aches
For all the people that I bond wit
Playin' for big stakes, on some Angus Bond shit
And if you want this, get right
That's why I love wack niggaz
Thanks for makin' my shit sound so tight
Because we got to get down tonight
With no beef, no clones, no biters or sound alikes
It ain't no ice, grills, or frowns tonight
I put my love in this, I swear to never put down the mic
This one is for the ladies and gents
That's partyin' and payin' the rent, when life just gets too intense
'Cause it ain't all about tryin' to ball
Get yo' hands up now 'cause we still got love for y'all
Eh yo, we ain't tryin' to be willies or thugs in it
We just wanna spread love in it
We spread love y'all, all across the globe
We spread love all across the globe
And from the west to the east to the north to the south
Keep rockin' and turn the party out
We spread love ya'll all across the globe
We spread love all across the globe
And to my man 9th Wonder, you don't stop
And to my man Big Pooh, you don't stop
And to my man Casar, you don't stop
Justus League, got to lead the sure shock
And to my man Vibrant, you don't stop
And to that cat Nicolade, you don't stop
And to my cats round the way, you don't stop
Keep on it, we gots to be the sure shock
And to my man Big Fingers, you don't stop
And to my man, uh yo, you don't stop
And to uh yo uh my man, you don't stop
My other man, you don't stop
