But never knew you would murder me What did I do? 
Knew you was right for me 
Knew I was right for you

Verse 2: 
Other people telling me I fell off 
Other people telling me I felt ya'll 
Momma telling me I should at least call

Felt like I was at the bottom of the sea-saw 
Felt like I was at the bottom of the sea-shore 
But 'cha gotta let a B ball 
And when you open up your eyes I hope u see more 
And when I see you I see detour

Verse 3: 
Uh 5 carrots on the finger got her hands smitten 
But everybody get a ring even Scotty Pippin 
Everybody got a thing but I guess mine isn't 
What my vision 
Soo I just sit in my Lamborghini let my top vibe wit me 
Kick back and get high wit me 
And if she still get me 
I hope my wife know she got a playa 4 life and that's no bullshitin 
I push love to its full limits 
Do a hundred-ninety in the lane called memory 
And I know you in that lane wit me 
But when the light change 
You didn't change wit it 
And now im honkin my horn 
gotta get that dead grass off of my lawn 
As I mow'z on, the chanpagne's never Froze-on 
As it pourz on the floor 
Chorus:
Lets make a toast 
To yooou and me 
Lets make a toast to honor the waaay you supposed to be 
Oh, oh, oh oooh
