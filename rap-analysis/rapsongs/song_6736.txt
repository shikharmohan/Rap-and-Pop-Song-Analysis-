Keep it shakin', Cali, keep it quakin'
'Cause the Ryders got me bringin' home the bacon
Show me love an' it wasn't no mistakin'
That I would dedicate this melody, fuck the hatin'
I had to tell my girl to pack her shit
'Cause she slipped an' dipped inside
I need a girl that's ready 2 ryde
To keep the heater right by her side
Aiyyo, so what the deal, Dogg? tell me, keep it real, Dogg
Niggaz seem stressed to the brain, how you feel, dogg?
Nigga, I'ma ride, set it up, let it spill, Dogg
Anythin' you want, I can flip, got the skill, Dogg
Baby girl, you so sophisticated
Finance related, you graduated
To the next level in the game, wearin' my name
Bad little brick house, go an' do that thang
Yo, niggaz surprised when they open they eyes
Thick in the thighs, wasn't part of they plan
Not just his bitch, I'm like his main man
Act shifty, your resistance gone swiftly
Bitches mad at a nigga, askin' why he kicked me
Stop whinin', just to cry an' get the mackin', daddy
I don't like it when the angry chick is actin' crabby
That's why he bagged me, ghetto jewel, never loud an' trashy
No stressin' over chicks,problem? Bet I solve it fastly
I had to tell my girl to pack her shit
'Cause she slipped an' dipped inside
I need a girl that's ready 2 ryde
To keep the heater right by her side
I had to tell my girl to pack her shit
'Cause she slipped an' dipped inside
I need a girl that's ready 2 ryde
To keep the heater right by her side
We gangbang on these niggaz like we 'posed to do
An' I'll be damned if I let a bitch get close to you
We posted, boo, you my one an' only
Quick to dump before the homies
Remember when that phony nigga ran up on me at the club?
You filled him up with slugs, that's what I call love
All that pushin' an' shovin', kissin' an' huggin'
Thuggin', dig it, dug in
I'm lovin' every minute of it, boo
The way you stay true an' always kept your cool
You kept the heater right by your thigh
An' when the shit got hectic, you was ready 2 ryde
You didn't run out when I pulled the gun out
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout, no doubt
Ruff Rydin', Eastsidin', to the realest y'know
D O double Gizze, you know how we get busy
Aiyyo, how could I leave a real nigga? A real nigga's all I need
Fake bitches try to take my place, fall to they knees
Don't violate, see my man, he don't like no scrapes
An' if I heard you was frontin', I hope on the case
Wild one? Maybe, but I'ma protect my baby
Test me fool an' by the end you gon' think I'm crazy
That's how I do for my Dogg, keep my nigga strong
Both sides relied on the shit, nigga, sing the song
I had to tell my girl to pack her shit
'Cause she slipped an' dipped inside
I need a girl that's ready 2 ryde
To keep the heater right by her side
I had to tell my girl to pack her shit
'Cause she slipped an' dipped inside
I need a girl that's ready 2 ryde
To keep the heater right by her side
Yeah, E V E, D O double Gizze, y'know
Ruff Rydin', Eastsidin' for life, yeah
An' you thought it'd never happen
Fuck the haters, bow wow
Beotch, it's official now, yeah
