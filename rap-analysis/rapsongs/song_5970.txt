Uncle Puffy can you read us a bedtime story? 
Please huh please? 
[Puff Daddy] 
Alright check this out right here... 
Woke up smoked up broked up 
What I had left and rolled up lit it 
Had a shorty that I brought home hit it 
Sent her on her way I got no time today 
With all this work I got no time to play 
Cash come and go and I want mine to stay 
Alot of these fake cats won't mind the day 
I get an unfair play then the stairway 
That's why I'm like TWA, the airway 
Niggas wantin to believe what they heard through hear say 
Hopin I'll forget it 
Check the mail it's a letter from jail from Hobokken 
I opened and I read it it said: 
What da deal son? 
It's ya nigga Teals in the field in this beel son 
I'ma have to feel one 
On the run with a gun, can't walk with it down and can't conceal one 
What to do? 
I dont' know if ya knew 
A kid, true, up in 1-2-2 he plottin to get you 
Now here's due 
You just do what need doin 
Let's not forget these niggas be bleedin' too , one 
OK good 
Those cats don't keep it real as they should 
Heard they don't pay good 
Standing around all day wishin they could 
But this green fufills they dreams 
They ain't a team 
Answering machine on screen 
Phone rings, it was Alene from Queens 
Head was mean 
Had a head for skeems 
Told her she could head the scene 
But she played her hand proper now you can't stop her 
Hey yo what up Playboy? 
I'm out in Saint Croix 
Whats up cats say they real, but they toys 
I heard ya doin' it though 
And you and ya flow 
Some niggas wanna ruin ya show? 
What up yo? 
Whathca wanna rip shop up on his block? 
Or I could leave him dead in his bed with his dick robbed 
[Puff Daddy] 
Na Boo, I'ma show you how I do 
Just hit me when you get up top 
Or come one through 
Now I'm doin inventory 
Guns, clips, vest, bullets 
So when I pull it it's the end of story 
Leavin my men in glory 
Then get shorty to hold a pound for me 
I know she down for me 
Yeah, sneak up on em like a car theif 
These niggas mad cause it's my party 
And my Benz is wide-bodied 
Despise me, like the feds despise Godi 
I kill for a hobby and latenly lobby 
So try me, go 'head and take a bite 
Might as well say good night 
Try to put me in the dark, I don't take it light 
Now if it's wrong make it right 
Not tommarow, tonight 
They barkin I know the bite 
Jumped in the B-N-Z 
Niggas gonna see the E-N-D 
Fuckin with me 
See I knew he was a snake out the ground 
Make me wanna call my man rock and break out the hounds 
Take it to the pier where you can't make out the sounds 
Thoughts in my head goin 'round 
It's goin down 
Pull up to his block, I'ma put it to his knock 
But, I don't see him, wouldn't wanna be him 
Damn, ride around for a minute 
Thinkin bout the pain that Hell brings 
Interupted by a cell ring 
Yeah yeah... 
(Hey Boo come and get me I'm here) 
(Where?) 
(Titaburough) 
Give me a few 
It was like I flew 
Felt kinda strange it was like I knew 
Pulled up around 2, late like I do 
With the urge to bug, she gave me a nervous hug 
And when I heard the slugs 
What I saw on the blur was thugs 
Tryin to soak my fur with blood 
Dropped to the curb and ducked 
Pulled out the fifth up behind the car like 
"How I'm gon' get out this shit?" 
These niggas don't know what they about to get 
A one way ticket to Hell my gun dealt 
Bust my gun at three and one fell 
The other two, waitin' to see what I'ma do 
[Men's Voice In Backround] 
[Puff Daddy] 
Peeped around the car slowly 
Then I let 'em have the whole week 
Man there's six million ways to die 
And you chose me 
But I'm an OG 
And in the distance is police 
I'm still bustin tryin to kill something 
And I can't hide the fact that I feel something 
I feel this thing, like in a minute, I won't feel a thing 
The two cats jumped in the blue AT 
I fired one shot, they fired two back 
They murked off in the night 
I get them fools back, man they ain't seen the last of me 
But I'm bleeding rapidly 
Shot up in the stomach and that wasn't how it had to be 
Heartbeat failin, car alarm wailin 
Couldn't walk straight then the firearm fell 
Now I'm thinkin how this bitch played me 
Then I faded 
(Sigh)
