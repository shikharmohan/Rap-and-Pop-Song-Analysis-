I am not a human being, pussy for lunch
Pop all the balloons and spit in the punch, yeah
Kush in the blunts
I ride through your block, see a foot in the trunk
I don't know why they keep playin', they better replay 'em
I'm givin' them the blues, Bobby "Blue" Bland
Together we stand and fall on y'all
Ballin' with my bloods, call it b-ball
These days ain't shit, Young Money is
I got Mars Bars, Three Musketeers
Come through coupe same color as veneers
And you know I'm ridin' with the toast, cheers
Yeah, now I'm back on my griz
And y'all's a bunch a squares like a motherfuckin' grid
Shit, fuck with me and get hit
I finger fuck the Nina, make the bitch have kids
Just do it my nigga, I just did
Name a motherfucker deeper than me, bitch dead
Ya dig, this here is big biz
And I scream fuck it, whoever it is
I am the rhymin' oasis
I got a cup of ya time, I won't waste it
I got my foot on the line, I'm not racin'
I thank God that I am not basic
I am not basic, I am not a human being
Uh, rock star, baby
Now come to my suite and get lockjaw, baby
Rich nigga lookin' at the cops all crazy
It's that mob shit nigga, Martin Scorsese
Heater close range 'cause people are strange
But I bet that AK .47 keep you ordained
You can't see Weezy nor Wayne, I'm in the far lane
I'm runnin' this shit, hundred yard gain
Uh, swag on infinity
I'm killin' 'em, see the white flag from the enemy
Shoot you in yo' head and leave your dash full of memories
Father, forgive me for my brash delivery
I will try you, I wouldn't lie, dude
I must be sticky 'cause them bitches got they eyes glued
Young Money, baby, we the shit like fly food
Y'all can't see us, like the bride shoes
I stand tall like a motherfuckin' 9'2"
I scream motherfuck you and whoever designed you
And if you think you hot, then obviously you were lied to
And we don't die, we multiply and then we come divide you
I am the rhymin' oasis
I got a cup of ya time, I won't waste it
I got my foot on the line, I'm not racin'
I thank God that I am not basic
I am not basic, I am not basic
I thank God that I am not basic, I am not a human being
Reportin' from another world
Magazine full of bullets, you can be my cover girl
Ness got the weed, rollin' thicker than a southern girl
Strong arm rap like a nigga did a hundred curls
Rock star beeotch, check out how we rock
And if this ain't hip hop, it must be me hop
I'm higher than a tree top, she lick my lollipop
I still get my candy from your girlfriend's sweet shop
Spittin' that heat rock, I'm smooth, not Pete Rock
And my, and my money on et cetera, three dots
Still get a stomach ache every time I see cops
You better run motherfucker 'cause we not
You better run 'til your feet stop
You ain't even on a fuckin' alphabet in my tea pot
Colder than a ski shop, holdin' on to the top
And even if I let go I still won't G-rock
I am the rhymin' oasis
I got a cup of ya time, I won't waste it
I got my foot on the line, I'm not racin'
I thank God that I am not basic
I am not, I am not a human being
