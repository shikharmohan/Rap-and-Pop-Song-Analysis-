Ecstatic, ecstatic, ecstatic
Classic flow
Super magic black origin freshly out of dopeness
Definitely out of dopeness, sketch another opus
Knock off your set, Brooklyn we keep 'em open
The heavens expand, the stars advance, feel the boogieman
Mojo hand healing power like bang
Snap, I rebuke these snitches
We know the truth, you can't confuse me bitches
Great name, greater than all your riches
Yeah, Dante Flaco Bey that's the business
Repeat, I rebuke these snitches
We know the truth, you can't confuse me bitches
Strong magic that bust all your wishes
Cherokee Chief rock upon cha rock it don't stop and let's get
Yes, you're now rockin' with the Def
It's like heartbeat, you make me feel so real
Super magic black origin freshly out of dopeness
Definitely out of dopeness, sketch another opus
Knock off your set, Brooklyn we keep 'em open
Again, again
Super magic black origin freshly out of dopeness
Definitely out of dopeness, sketch another opus
Knock off your set, come close and get 'em open
Get it here, let it go
Ecstasy
The heavens expand, the stars advance, feel the boogieman
