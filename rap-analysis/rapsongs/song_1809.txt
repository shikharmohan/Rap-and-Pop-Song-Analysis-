Ask me if I cry
I'll tell you why I can, come on
I'm gonna go hard whether I'm right or wrong
'Til the dead and gone, it's on
What y'all really want? Bring it on
I'ma let life be my song
I'm gonna go hard whether I'm right or wrong
'Til the dead and gone, it's on
What y'all really want? Bring it on
I'ma let life be my song
How I live is simple, walk through the streets
Talk to the beats, New York, I'ma eat
I ain't never had a problem with survivin'
No problems with gettin' down, bustin' my *** or Ruff Rydin'
Cats talk slick but I talk slicker
My *** for real 'cause I'm that ***
Reason that you hurtin' is you gotta take your problems
Straight to the Lord, no one, only He can solve 'em
See what I see but look through my eyes
The Devil is a liar, the truth never lies
We all got issues, s*** that we go through
S*** that we been through, s*** that we won't do
The pain that we bring upon ourself
For no reason, is the worst
That's why I say I'm blessed with the curse
The Lord gave it all to me and in the process
I lost my soul, damn, Devil got a hold
In my mind, I'm like a little boy lost in crime
Like the healthy *** that the Devil forced into dyin'
Lord knows I'm tryin' but at the same time
You hit a *** with the weight of the world
Why you gave it to Earl?
I'm gonna go hard whether I'm right or wrong
'Til the dead and gone, it's on
What y'all really want? Bring it on
I'ma let life be my song
I'm gonna go hard whether I'm right or wrong
'Til the dead and gone, it's on
What y'all really want? Bring it on
I'ma let life be my song
To live is to suffer and I'm livin' it up
Face everyday chin up, I ain't givin' it up
If I ain't givin' a ***, then who will?
So I hope for the best, knowin' that it's all uphill
Sometimes I wonder what life's about
Sometimes I wonder why I take the wrong route
Then turn around and go out and no doubt
The fate is mine is blind
So whatever, *** it, I'ma roll out
We all go through the motions
We get different notions
We each have our own ocean
That we can either drown in or float
Like the vessels that we are
Vessels that would carry many far
You don't know what to say when you talkin'
We don't know who you gon' see when you walkin'
If you don't know how much of what you do is dirt
3 things you don't know could get you hurt
I'm gonna go hard whether I'm right or wrong
'Til the dead and gone, it's on
What y'all really want? Bring it on
I'ma let life be my song
I'm gonna go hard whether I'm right or wrong
'Til the dead and gone, it's on
What y'all really want? Bring it on
I'ma let life be my song
I'm gonna go hard whether I'm right or wrong
'Til the dead and gone, it's on
What y'all really want? Bring it on
I'ma let life be my song
I'm gonna go hard whether I'm right or wrong
'Til the dead and gone, it's on
What y'all really want? Bring it on
I'ma let life be my song
I'm gonna go hard whether I'm right or wrong
'Til the dead and gone, it's on
What y'all really want? Bring it on
I'ma let life be my song
I'm gonna go hard whether I'm right or wrong
'Til the dead and gone, it's on
What y'all really want? Bring it on
I'ma let life be my song
I'm gonna go hard whether I'm right or wrong
'Til the dead and gone, it's on
What y'all really want? Bring it on
I'ma let life be my song
I'm gonna go hard whether I'm right or wrong
'Til the dead and gone, it's on
What y'all really want? Bring it on
I'ma let life be my song
