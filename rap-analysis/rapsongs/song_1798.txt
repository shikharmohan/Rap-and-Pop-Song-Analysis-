There we go, okay, okay
Don't do me greasy, okay
Uh, aye, yo, you know what a dog needs?
Do you really know what a dog needs?
Uh, a dog needs a, grr
(What? What?)
A dog needs a, grr
(Come on)
Not just any uh, but a real, uh
That's gonna hold that dog down
Arf, arf
Baby, I am what I am, I'm gon' be who I be
Everything from chasing a cat to pissin' on a tree
Let me see what I gotta see, do what I gotta do
Dog for life but keep it true
Every once in a while I'll break out the backyard to roam
And get reckless but I still know that home is home
And when I get there I'ma sit there, take a shit there, put my dick there
Do I handle my business? Shit, yeah
I'ma run 'til I bust my gun and empty the clip
Never come home, I gotta go just gimme the whip
I ain't got time for the lip, just open the fence
Let me go, I'll come back, I ain't got time to convince
Ever since I was a pup, I've been stuck with the street shit
Keep the heat, shit, fuck it, nigga, gotta eat
I past on the weak shit, if it's out there I want it all at one time
So when it's my time, I've done it
I know you kill for me, you'll die for me
I know you like to rip and run the streets
But I get nervous sometimes, baby, I can't help to think
You might not make it home to eat, I barely sleep
Could you pick up the phone and call me at home?
And let me know you ain't in some heat
And don't go crying, you're grown, you know I'm lookin' out for you
'Cause you be lookin out for me, me, me
(Yo, you can go with your dogs)
If you make this promise to me, you make it back in one piece
(So, you can go head and ball)
If you make this promise to me, you make it back in one piece
('Fore you go bettin' it all)
If you make this promise to me, you make it back in one piece
(I know you up in it all)
If you make this promise to me, you make it back in one piece
Piece, piece
And oh boy, I know you go to do what you do
You're makin' moves, I'm makin' moves yo, we coo
(What? What? What?)
Lay on your paws I got your back if you fall
Nothin's too big, nothin's too small just go ball
Uh, dog tags around my neck, the streets are mine
I might leave the heat behind 'cause in the streets I'm fine
That's why niggas sleep till nine, out by ten back by ten
Sleep til' nine, do it again
If you love somethin', let it go, if it comes back to you, it's yours
If it doesn't fuck it, you'll never know
You got me I got you, dog with a dog, ride till we die
If it's on, then it's on
(Yo, you can go with your dogs)
If you make this promise to me, you make it back in one piece
(So, you can go head and ball)
If you make this promise to me, you make it back in one piece
('Fore you go bettin' it all)
If you make this promise to me, you make it back in one piece
(I know you up in it all)
If you make this promise to me, you make it back in one piece
Piece, piece
(Yo, you can go with your dogs)
If you make this promise to me, you make it back in one piece
(So, you can go head and ball)
If you make this promise to me, you make it back in one piece
('Fore you go bettin' it all)
If you make this promise to me, you make it back in one piece
(I know you up in it all)
If you make this promise to me, you make it back in one piece
Piece, piece
(Yo, you can go with your dogs)
If you make this promise to me, you make it back in one piece
(So, you can go head and ball)
If you make this promise to me, you make it back in one piece
('Fore you go bettin' it all)
If you make this promise to me, you make it back in one piece
(I know you up in it all)
If you make this promise to me, you make it back in one piece
Piece, piece
(Yo, you can go with your dogs)
If you make this promise to me, you make it back in one piece
(So, you can go head and ball)
If you make this promise to me, you make it back in one piece
('Fore you go bettin' it all)
