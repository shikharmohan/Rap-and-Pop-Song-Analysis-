So they ask me,"Young Boy
What you gonna do the second time around?
How you gon' comeback?"
I tried told em' I come back like 32
I jump back like 33, uhh, hit me
That's nothin', dis here's tha Carter II people
Dis here's tha Carter II people
Hey, they call me Mr. Carter, I kiss the daughter
Of the dead's forehead, I killed the father
Spilled the heart of a mildew hater
I will put dem body on chill like glaciers, gracias
I'm crazy, yes, it's obvious, goin' against me is atheist
I got my angels on my shoulda and a quarter of dat angel dust
I ain't sniffin', I'm just pitchin' ya honor, I ain't snitchin' ya honor
Hate bitch niggas, bitches with power
Vacate when dat kitchen get hotta, I just sit on da counter
Open da cabinet, close the cupboard
Put dat jar in da skillet, drop a 4 in the bubbles
I rememba bein' young, tryna hustle my dough
Tryna tell da old junkies dat my crack ain't soap
Tryna tell ya fo' ya jump dat my mack ain't broke
You ain't trynna see how far that black back lane go, no
Call me Pacman, you ghosts is blue
I got my red river rubies and my ocean blue
Jewelry, usually I'm a hooligan for da money
Yeah, I'm eatin' but I gotta tapeworm in my tummy, oh
Make harm and I bomb you in public
Hit you wit' da straight arm, no warnin', nothin'
Look it's mornin', no yawnin' or nothin'
I ain't sleepin', I'm up tryna take a nigga lunch
You gon' make a nigga break a nigga fronts
Then shake a nigga shorts, then we takin' what we want
I'm so 5 0 4, you gotta kill me here
If you eva lookin' for me, bitch I will be here
Cash Money is a Army, Navy Seal me here
Lotta niggas ran from it, but I still be here
No chrome on da Continental, I'm so fundamental
Crack da fill, crack da roof, and roll up da windows
And my hood love me, they tell me bring it home
That's why I holla Hollygrove on each and every song
You leapin' at a dog
A dog wit' no bark, just a bite like a old shark
And all you rich niggas know Pa
I'm talkin' 'bout stunna
He like, keep ya dough, he got ya hoe
When da sunshines on da king and sets on the prince
I met The Birdman and I been shinin' eva since like that
