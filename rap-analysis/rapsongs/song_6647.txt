You remind me of a model on the runway
You remind me of that girl in my dreams
Please don't mind me if I tell you that I want you
Just imagine all the things we'd do
In the bedroom (x2)
In the club (x2)
In the car
I don't care
All the thangs we'd do
On the island (x2)
On vacation (x2)
On a plane
I don't care
All the thangs we'd do
Tell me where you never been or where you wanna go
So I can get it together, you know
Jet skis, green trees
I even got money n honey for bees
I need that so we can just do that
Take a little dip where the pool at
Got that pop that knock that
In the bedroom, lady said stop that
Whyyyyy
I'm fly people know a GY
Private plane in the sky
20,000 feet high
With a club inside
We can do whatever we like until we die?
In London, Miami
Me and you can go there
Chicago, Toronto
Me and you can go there
Atlanta, New York City
Me and you can go there
Las Vegas, big paper
All the thangs we'd do
You remind me of a model on the runway
You remind me of that girl in my dreams
Please don't mind me if I tell you that I want you
Just imagine all the things we'd do
In the bedroom (x2)
In the club (x2)
In the car
I don't care
All the thangs we'd do
On the island (x2)
On vacation (x2)
On a plane
I don't care
All the thangs we'd do
You remind me of a runway model
Run away Lamborghini full throttle
Fine, yeh, one of a kind
Call you a spade, shaped like a bottle
Girl of the grey goose, baby don't mind
If i see it then i mean it, i ain't spittin no lie
Make it clear like a south beach water
Lie a few millies like my neighborhood carter
Bahamas, Jamaica,
Me and u can go there,
California to Euston
Me and you can go there
Paris back to dallas
Me and you can go there
Porto rico, big paper
All the thangs we'd do
You remind me of a model on the runway
You remind me of that girl in my dreams
Please don't mind me if I tell you that I want you
Just imagine all the things we'd do
I used to dream about a girl like you,
Like styles like this, i cant believe its true
Im used to them girls that are full of drama
You the type of girl, you bring home your mama
Forget about the stress, no trouble of the day
We could see the whole world in a couple of days
Out this world, we can get there sooner
From Beijing catch that flight to the moon
You remind me of a model on the runway
You remind me of that girl in my dreams
Please don't mind me if I tell you that I want you
Just imagine all the things we'd do
In the bedroom (x2)
In the club (x2)
In the car
I don't care
All the thangs we'd do
On the island (x2)
On vacation (x2)
On a plane
I don't care
All the thangs we'd do
You remind me of a model on the runway
You remind me of that girl in my dreams
Please don't mind me if I tell you that I want you
Just imagine all the things we'd do
