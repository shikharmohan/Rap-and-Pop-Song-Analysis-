This is a ghetto public announcement (weed smokers)
Roll your blunts tight
And light your joints
Inhale...slowly exhale
And that's how you get high.
(clip from Friday)
I know you don't smoke weed... I know this
But I'm gonna get you high today
Cause it's Friday, you ain't got no job, and you ain't got shit to do
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my Hennessy {*repeat 8X*}
(Inhale....exhale) Eyes selling red, got my dank from the Bahamas
Went to see my girl smoke some green with her mama
Jumped in my Cutlass on the way to the liquor store
Picked up some blunts, got ten on the 2-0
Fix these palm trees wit some green leaves
Got a nigga's head spinning like the seven seas
Puff, puff, pass, nigga that's what Simon say
Fools that hog the green or da weed gonna get carried away
Fingernails burnt, lookin like a tweeker
Ears steadily poppin, but not from the speakers
Green got me hungry, fiendin for them munchies
cause real smokers don't blow no fuckin green on empty stomachs
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my Hennessy {*repeat 4X*}
Green trees pack wood, make cabbage
I like to get high but it ain't a bad habit
Speed up with that weed smoke comin out my 'llac
Got a hottie in the front and one in the back
Blowin shotguns to me and my homie
I feel like this weed make a young nigga horny
I stopped the fuckin lac at Holiday Inn
I ain't even trippin, told the girls to come in
Laid her down steady cause she know I'm ready
Choppin up weed like motherfuckin spaghetti
Hoes down south must know voodoo
cause every time I hit the weed I'm lookin for Isuzus
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my Hennessy {*repeat 5X*}
Y'all high yet?
Pass me da green, I need some weed with my Hennessy {*repeat 3X*}
Damn nigga y'all chokin, get the fuck out of here nigga
Pass me da green I need some weed with my Hennessy
Nigga I said are y'all high yet?
Pass me da green I need some weed with my Hennessy {*repeat 3X*}
Oh, you think you trippin now huh?
You thinkin you hearing voices nigga?
Well, if you is then you high nigga, but if you ain't
