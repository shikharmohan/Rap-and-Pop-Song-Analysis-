Follow me, upon a Black Star Line
Off for the rest and for Brand Nubian
Now go to Africa again, watch dis!
Black Star Line, it's the Black Star Line
Everybody come aboard, and free your mind
Black Star Line, it's the Black Star Line
Everybody come aboard, and free your mind
Black Star Line, it's the Black Star Line
Everybody come aboard, and free your mind
Black Star Line, it's the Black Star Line
Everybody come aboard, and free your mind
It's the Black Star Line that's leavin' at nine
Here's a paid ticket so you can free your mind
Playgrounds is filled with visions of steel
Grab the black babies, it's time to build
See we got a mental ship somethin' like Noah's Ark
Spark your brain cell, now let's set sail
With no avail, we flowin' on a positive trip
All Nubians is welcome, male and female
I, wouldn't resort, to askin' for a passport
Love vibes rule so your black face is cool
Cool, but not frozen, a trip for the chosen few
Form a line-ah, upon the Black Star Liner
Goin' to Africa, one more time
Goin' to Africa, one more time
Goin' to Africa, one more time
Form a line-ah, upon the Black Star Liner
Goin' to Africa, one more time, true
Let me tell you bout Marcus Garvey
Born in Jamaica, God left him in country
He go to America to make black people free
He walk around low and just try make money
Him buy up some ship and just start for we
America or Africa and live irie
We have some man where wan gonna be
Young nasty and just licky licky
Some love Marcus Garvey, the place of peace
Or peace around it, and dem sparkle up him say
I just light up, make the first hungry
Writer no block it but just run follow me
Form a line-ah, upon the Black Star Liner
Goin' to Africa, one more time
Form a line-ah, upon the Black Star Liner
Brand Nubian, tell dem one more time
As we look to the stars, they take ours
Yeah, we got fly cars but you can live in four wheels?
We need new approaches, old style is null and void
Makes me paranoid, to think
That we own the whole ocean yet we can't even drink
You couldn't swim the nine thousand so we got you a means
Of transportation, for the Nubian nation
Marcus Garvey had the idea back in the days
Doin' for self, keepin' the wealth
I gotta add on and create
Though the devil thinks
It's not the latest fashion
Navigatin' lost, somethin' like a ship's captain
Black Star Line, it's the Black Star Line
Everybody come aboard, and free your mind
Black Star Line, it's the Black Star Line
Everybody come aboard, and free your mind
Black Star Line, it's the Black Star Line
Everybody come aboard, and free your mind
Black Star Line, it's the Black Star Line
Everybody come aboard, and free your mind
When I'm ova, arms will be raised for the tom-toms

Push up ya arm they call ya proud to be black
