Hello darkness, hello sunshine
Hello not at all, hello all the time
Hello nowhere, hello oblivion
Hello goodbye
Hello darkness, hello sunshine
Hello not at all, hello all the time
Hello nowhere, hello oblivion
Hello goodbye
Hello darkness
You, you, you, you, you
All in together, the weather is better than ever
I hope it never ends I hope it lasts forever
But when it does, we can all pretend
That it's better than it's ever been
Lie to ourselves like the sky to rebel
And it's well and it's fine and it's fine if it fell
And you couldn't find the story line
If you survive to retell, we are targets
Hello darkness, hello sunshine
Hello not at all, hello all the time
Hello nowhere, hello oblivion
Hello goodbye
Said everything is going to be fine
Said everything is gonna be okay
Said just don't breathe the air
He just sits and waits for them to kick in the door
He once was a hero they don't love him no more
There's a blast, every time a foot hits the floor
His gift for not fighting another man's war
And if they can get their hands on the mask that he wore
On his face, they can put somebody else in his place and restore
The state, the illusion that it's safe
The faith, that being a slave is so great
As gas fills the room and rockets destroy
Everything around him he stands to find himself surround
By thousands of soldiers that his once trained
To never miss their targets, heartless
Hello darkness, hello sunshine
Hello not at all, hello all the time
Hello nowhere, hello oblivion
Hello goodbye
Hello darkness
Please to make your acquaintance
Salutations, Kanechiwa
Hello end of the world
How are you? I do fine
Hello darkness, hello sunshine
Hello not at all, hello all the time
Hello nowhere, hello oblivion
Hello goodbye
Hey there darkness, hey there sunshine
Hello not at all, hello all the time
Hello nowhere, hello oblivion
Hello goodbye
Hello darkness, hello sunshine
Definite, uncool
