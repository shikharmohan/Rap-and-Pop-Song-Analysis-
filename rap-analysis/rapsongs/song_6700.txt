Uh.
Yea.
(don't let go)
Life, life
(don't let go)
I'm the coldest of the coldest, the dopest of the dopest
The smoothest of the smoothest and locest of the locest
The whole world on point for this new joint that I just put together
So kindly, and you can find on the coast with the most lambs
High post, plain coast with a bunch thug niggas, drug dealers
Project fools, c-murder past dem tools
Shit I'm bout to make these motherfuckers get up
I draw the line between yours and mine
And make sure you don't get lit up
Hit ha on the motha fickin set when dip
Dogg pound mutha fuckin gangsta crew
Split wigs for a livin everydays thanksgiving
Mutha fuck y'all rides, we slides we dippin
Nigga the tanks, driven by the colonel mr. master p
Lil silkky, mystikal, c and me and fiend
Nigga don't be trippin, you got my lil homie in the cut
That soulja slim nigga , he known for dippin
Wassup
(don't let go)
If you love ta bang bang
And the rap game is just like the dope game
The minute you forget it, forget it you finished
Them niggas know when you ain't with it
Thats when they get ignent
(don't let go)
Like a twista, like a twista, get twisted with this
It seems it's on, but it's off, I keep missin this shit
I'm high but I try to stay focused wide eye
Lookin dead at the chips, I blink, they dip
(don't let go)
Like a twista like a twista get twisted with this
It seems it's on but it's off I keep missing this shit
I'm high but I try to stay focused wide eye
Lookin dead at the chips, I blink, they dip
(don't let go)
It's worth to hang on for life
For life (don't let go)
Its worth the hang on (don't let go)
Yea
