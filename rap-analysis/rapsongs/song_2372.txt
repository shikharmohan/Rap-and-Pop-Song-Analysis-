[Intro]
What we have to do is deal with it when these idividuals are young enough. If you wish to be saved, not in a religious sense but not to constitute what this country at times calls if or which over. We seem to be approaching an age of the gross. We all have this idea that we should move up from our parents station and each generation should do a little bit better.
[Verse 1- Eminem] 
Come on, let's cut the bullshit enough 
Let's get it started, let's start addressing this issue and open it up 
Let's take this shit back to bassment 
And we can disscuss statements thats made on this tape 
And its whole origin of the music that we all know and love 
The music that we all enjoy the music you all accuse me of tryna destroy 
Let's rewind it to 89 when I was a boy on the east side of Detroit 
Crossin 8 Mile in the warnin and hit territory 
I'd like to share a story, this is my story and cant no body tell it for me 
You will well inform me, I am well aware that I don't belong here
You've made that perfectly clear, I get my ass kicked damn near everywhere
From Bel-Air shopping center just for stopping in there
From the black side all the way to the white side
Okay there's a bright side a day that I might slide
You may call it a past I call it haulin' my ass
Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks
Oh them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks
Them good old notorious oh well known tracks
[Chorus x2]
Come on lets go back
Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
I once used to call home sweet home
[Verse 2- Eminem] 
I'd roam the streets so much they call me a drifter 
Sometimes I stick up a thumb just to hitch hike 
Just to get picked up to get me a lift to 8 mile and van dike 
And steal a god damn bike from somebody's backyard 
And drop it off at the park that was the half way mark 
To meet Kim had to walk back to her mama's on Schaumers after dark 
To sneak me in the house when I'm kicked out my mom's 
That's about the time I first met Proof with Goofy Gary on the steps 
where I's born handin out some flyers, he was doin some talent shows 
At Center Line High, I told him to stop by and check us out sometime 
He looked at me like I'm out my mind, shook his head like white boys dont know how to rhyme
I spit out a line and rhymed birthday with first place
And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike
We was on the same shit that Big Daddy Kane shit with compound syllables sound combined
From that day we was down to ride somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line
[Chorus x2]
Come on lets go back
Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
I once used to call home sweet home
[Verse 3- Eminem] 
My first year in 9th grade, can't forget that day at school 
It was cool till your man MC Shan came through 
And said that Puma was the brand 'cause the clan makes Troops 
It was rumors but man god damned they flew 
Musta been true because man we done banned they shoes 
I had the new ones the Cool J, Ice land swayed too
And we just threw them in the trash like they yesterday's news
Guess who came through next, X Clan debut
Professor X and glorious exists in a state of red, black, and green
With a key sissies now with this bein a new trend
We don't fit in crackas is out with Cactus albums
Blackness is in, African symbols and medallions
Represents black power and we ain't know what it meant
Me and my man Howard and Butter would go to the mall with 'em
All over our necks like we're showin 'em off not knowin at all
We was bein laughed at you ain't even half black
You ain't supposed to have that homie let me grab that
And that Flavor Flav clock we gon' have to snatch that
All I remember is meetin back at Manix's basement
Sayin how we hate this, how racist but dope the X Clan tape is
Which reminds me back in 89 me and Kim broke up for the first time
She was tryna two time me and there was this black girl
At our school who thought I was cool 'cause I rapped so she was kinda eyein me
And oh the irony guess what her name was ain't even gon' say it plus
The same color hair as hers was and blue contacts and a pair of jugs
The bombest god damn girl in our whole school if I could pull it
Not only would I become more popular but I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time
But it backfired I was supposed to dump her but she dumped me for this black guy
And thats the last I ever seen or heard or spoke to the oh foolish pride girl
But I've heard people say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad
But it was I singled out a whole race and for that apologize
I was wrong 'cause no matter what color a girl is she still a [whore?]
[Chorus x2]
Come on lets go back
Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
I once used to call home sweet home
