(Who, alright, who, uh, alright, who)
I see uhh, y'all don't understand, huh
(Alright)
But, let me see if I can, uhh
(Who)
Make it a lil mo clearer for y'all
Can't walk on water or jump over buildings or nothing
But I was the first to get ya hurt and get the fuck out rapper
So pay attention to what I put on the chalkboard
I'm the start of the concrete, the lyrical lawnmower
You can say this the house I built, off'a shit bitch fuck dat filt
Non filt ba'dat-tat-tat, boom boom boom
Your Louisiana number one Zorro of the two boom
Get caught, roll thru, hold back, come short, go gold, fall off, fuck dat
I told ya I was coming back harder and I meant that shit
Yeah, I mad a couple million dollars last year but I spent that bitch
Like Martin Luther king ya'll project jealous and ya want me killed
Like the white man from town, got me on the scope
But I won't stand still, 'cause I put the haaa-o in da hot sauce
And the jaguar with the top off, see I started it

Big Trunk
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright

And I do not like to promote violence
Or diss other artists or nothin'
But I'm faithful to gumbo and it's killed to be killed
The game, jack knife, cutthroat, let it rip
Don't hold back shit, nigga say what ya feel, Fa eva
It's graphic and explicit, but I be rappin' up in dis bitch
That's how I do it when I kick it and who-eva it is that complain
Only reason you got somethin' to say if I'm late
'Cause I'm the only reason you came
This is for the grown folks and if you don't like what I'm doin'
You can suck my daddy long stroke
Been crunk, been trunk tight
Those was the school days, Gamma Phi Kappa Si
If ya stumble, they don't see ya nigga, play it off
But if they disrespect you, front ya, take they head off
So this is what it's come to, don't give a fuck
Nigga what, nigga who
Who, who, who, who, who, who
Mystikal
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
See I started it
Who, who, who, who, who, who

And you ain't got nothin' out
So nigga fuck where you come from
Nigga fuck what you talkin' 'bout
Heads rolled, less bread, I'm talkin' my way
Some'o bitch ass nigga with somethin' to say
I'll think ya'll know how serious I be
And how real I be getting' when I be up in here kickin' dis shit
I guess I'mma have to show you, take a picture, no sympathy
See my face and remember me
