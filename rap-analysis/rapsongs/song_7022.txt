Aiyyo somethin' funny somethin' got you caught up in digs
It's me why you wanna pimp with today
Two made from the boy yeah
Now helpless he's tryin' 'cause he full of giggles
You gonna need more than an iron
To stretch out ya wrinkles
You startin' so ordinary and me map me out for sprinkler
You got the fever for the flavor for the giggles
Who got the giggles is the jam of December, hey
I remember we release specifically
Back in grammar school days it's me the E's M T
Totally and directly wonder more than too fresh and nuttin' really else today
It was my accent and where I came from that ya really hate
The 'N' wear Levi's, Pumas, struggle Adidas
Some say I'm with the losers 'cause I didn't have the ladies
No R E F P's, the T as we can't get no punanny definitely hittin' them daily
No I roll with the squad that's so hard and makes
You wanna catch an erection, relax man
I don't allow you to put out actin' on if the one's direction
So it's Pete prop yo what's up man, hah
So if ya were thankful then I see 'cause the paper
Gettin' murderin' like the a lovin' now the news Rodney King is
Now with the double list comin' through your speakers
Remember durin' steebers why don't you get your speakers teetered
Who got the giggles?
You got the giggles, they got the giggles
Everybody got the giggles
Who got the giggles?
You got the giggles, they got the giggles
Everybody got the giggles
Now ya wanna be down you come around
Touch gun of the town you gotta dig my sound
It seems like everybody's jumpin' on the bandwagon
Her money grabbin' a chick is a suburban dragon
I wasn't all of that rappin'  but this is now
What's the matter? Ya milkin' like a freakin' cow
Cat guns yo' Tennessee, here kitty, kitty, kitty
Here pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy cat
You start to smell like one all you really are was the head
I wanna give a shout out to those who try and curse
My fave for balackin' gat you were funny though shall, shall,
Leave the play down these are the things we can do without, huh
So what's this all about man?
Just when I thought I was chillin' with my Lee's
And my fellas seeds and my pro kicks
My style was so deaf 'Thuggin' won't even make it fresh' he said
So now I need my tracks that 'Bite neck' Fred
It's that ya mess with it's just stitches that I thread
Loadin' the clip for go twenty four carat lead
Her double days puttin' 'G' at her head  rapow, you're dead
Who got the giggles?
You got the giggles, they got the giggles
Everybody got the giggles

Everybody got the giggles
You ever havin' the giggles to the huh
The hiccups the kinda hiccups
That makes ya wanna come up
In your face and throw up you're totally smuck
You feelin' dirty and quitter you neither or either a home or hitter
Much more like Peter but couldn't beat her pick
Caught in the middle with the rhythm, you're feelin'
Wish she trippin', you'll be livin' with the aha, the giggles
Who got the giggles?
You got the giggles, they got the giggles
Everybody got the giggles
Who got the giggles?
You got the giggles, they got the giggles
Everybody got the giggles

Who got the giggles man? Everybody got the giggles
