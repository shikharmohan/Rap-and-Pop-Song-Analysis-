Access to her cove, lovestruck was my mode
Took a look, dropped my textbook, Jenifa, oh
Breakfast, broke it fast, she was in my English class
Asked for notes, rocked my boat, Jenifa, oh
Jenny lost her favorite penny, so I gave her a dollar
She kissed me and I hollered
In a flash the school bell rang, Jenny grabbed onto my hand
Took me home and said, "Trugoy, just swing it, swing it, swing"
The Downstairs where we met, I'd brought records, she'd cassettes
Lost a break, found her shake, Jenifa, oh, Jenny
Transcripts showed more than flirt, 'I love daisies' read her shirt
Grabbed my jeans, Jimmy screamed, Jenifa, oh, Jenny
Morals shaped like the floss, no-one could live their life for Pos
Found her house, aroused my joust, Jenifa, oh, Jenny
Her clothes I did shuck, just like Dan I strictly stuck
To the punt, she cried, "Kick it", Posdnous was in
Jenny only thought about Jimmy but asked was I a virgin
Like some kid named Derwin?
She said, "Let's try it in the bathroom" but the 'nous is way above sinks
So to the kitchen she did Dan and came back wrapped in Saran
Now wait a minute
Little Derwin got somethin' to show us
That Jenny could never do, listen
Hey, look at little Derwin
Look at him go, look at him go
Aww, baby
Positions, muscles flexed, Dove was lost in a Ghana hex
Passed her test, felt her teddy, Jenifa, oh, Jenny
Notions soothed the mood, Dove was lost in De La Heaven
Scream Plug 2, did the do, Jenifa, oh, Jenny
Jenny teased my homeboy Granny
In fact she teased so many
She was known as a garden tool
No more I dispatch, was it Jimmy, had met his match?
Or could it be the realization all girls owned a Jenny?
For normal health I have fought, a valuable lesson she had taught
Don't flaunt that, the candy is good unless you came with plenty
