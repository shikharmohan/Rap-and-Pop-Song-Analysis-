Cats slide to the hood
But I walk through it
Holdin' my fuckin' dick
And that's all to it
This ain't no new shit
Told ya when I metcha
Show some fuckin' respect
Knock before ya enter
Betcha, if it's me that's comin' to getcha
It's gonna be a back down an'let's betcha
For real, y'all niggas don't know pain
'Cuz y'all niggas don't know me
And that's my name
Ain't a fuckin' thing changed, still tha same
Y'all got dope but rob niggas
So be mob, niggas
Why you be hard niggas?
Through the street I rep that
Beat and scar niggas
Respect that an' step back
Come at me sideways
And get laid down where ya stand
With the cannons so stop
All the dirty fuckin looks
'Cause y'all niggas ain't fuckin crooks
Fuck around and get took
Give 'em what they want
(C'mon)
Give 'em what they want

They all can't get it
Give 'em what they want

I make moves, I break rules
Pistol whip niggas if they got fake jewels
I take tools
(Get money wid 'em)
I make rules
(Get bloody in 'em)
Fuckin' with that nigga Earl Simmons
Will have you in the middle a da ocean swimmin'
Up to creek with no paddle
Y'all niggas fuck
Right when you sholda bucked
Y'all niggas ducked
Stuck 'em down
That's your mutherfuckin' luck
(What?)
Clown, what now?
Keep fuckin' playin'
I'm gonna keep a nigga 6 feet deep layin'
Shit keeps sprayin'
Watch y'all sayin'?
Don't want nuthin'
(C'mon)
Y'all niggas known for frontin'
