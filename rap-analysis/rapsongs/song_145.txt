This is a Missy Elliot one time exclusive
(Come on)
Is it worth it, let me work it
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
I put my thing down, flip and reverse it
I put my thing down, flip and reverse it
If you got a big elephant, let me search ya
To find out how hard I gotta work ya
I put my thing down, flip and reverse it
I put my thing down, flip and reverse it
Unh, yeah
Now, Missy, she too much for me
(I'm freaky)
She took me to to the crib man, she told me, eat me
Now my baby mama I told her ass not to beat me
Her broke ass wanna fight, Missy know how to treat me
She sitting on cash, she got money out the ass
Gave her them back shots and got money out her ass
Now you can see me in the coupe like what
Next time I'll hit her in that G5 truck
I've got the magic stick, I can go for hours
From the bed to the floor, to the sink to the shower
With her back to the bed and her legs to the sky
I can go hard, know why, big girls don't cry
I had visions of Missy with her money by the tub
Ching, ching, jackpot, I think I'm in love
I'm looking for Missy now so I can get my back rubbed
This the shit she hollered in my ear before we left the club
I'd like to get to know ya, so I can show ya
Put the herb on ya, like I told ya
Gimme all your numbers so I can phone ya
Your girl acting stank than call me ovah
Not on the bed, lay me on your sofa
Call before you come, I need to shave my chocha
You do or you don't or you will or you won't cha
Go downtown and eat it like a vulcha
See my hips and my tips don'tcha
See my ass and my lips don'tcha
Lost a few pounds in my whiffs for ya
This the kinda beat that go, wa ta ta
Ra ta ta ta, ta ta ta ta ta
Sex me so good I say blah blah blah
Work it, I need a glass of wat ah
Boy, oh, boy, it's good to know ya
Is it worth it, let me work it
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
I put my thing down, flip and reverse it
I put my thing down, flip and reverse it
If you got a big elephant, let me search ya
To find out how hard I gotta work ya
I put my thing down, flip and reverse it
I put my thing down, flip and reverse it
If you're a fly gyal, get your nails done
Get a pedicure, get your hair did
Boy lift it up, let's make a toast ah
Lets get drunk, its gon' bring us close ah
Don't I look like a Halle Berry post ah?
See dem Belvedere playin' tricks on ya
Girlfriend wanna be like me nevah
You won't find a bitch that's even bettah
I make it hot as Las Vegas weath ah
Listen up close while I take you backwards
Watch the way Missy like to take it backwards
I'm not a prostitute but I can give you whatchu want
I love your braids and your mouth full of funk
Love the way my ass ba-bump ba-bump bump
Keep your eyes on my ba-bump ba-bump bump
And think you can handle this ga-donk ga-donk donk
Take my thong off and my ass go boom
Cut the lights off so you see what I can do
Is it worth it, let me work it
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
I put my thing down, flip and reverse it
I put my thing down, flip and reverse it
If you got a big elephant, let me search ya
To find out how hard I gotta work ya

Boys, boys, all type of boys
Black, white, Puerto Rican, Chinese boys
Thanga thang, thanga thang
Girls, girls, get that cash
If it's nine to five or shakin' ya ass
Ain't no shame ladies, do your thang
Just make sure you ahead of tha game
Just 'cause I got a lot of fame supah
Prince couldn't get me change my name papa
Kunta Kinte, enslave a game, no sir
Picture black sayin', "Oh yessuh massa"
Picture Lil' Kim dating a pastor
Minute man, big men can outlast ya
Who is the best? I don't have to ask ya
When I come out, you won't even mattah
Why you act dumb like ugh, duh
So you act dumb like ughh, duh
And the drummer boy go pa-rum pa-pum pum
