[Verse 1 - Gudda Gudda]
Okay I'm sippin' on the syrup
Got a nigga movin' slow
I'm all about the money
What the fuck you think I do it fo'?
Bitch don't act like you don't know
I'm killin' all these rap niggas
Custom made casket for yo' muthafuckin' funeral
Keep the women with me
Shit I gotta keep like two or mo'
Party everyday like we won the fuckin' Superbowl
Chillin' wit' my nigga Mack, he keep bitches handy
White girl on the table love them sniff the nose candy
When I'm walkin' by the women say "Who is that nigga?"
I replied "Hi, I am Gudda Gudda that nigga."
I was raised in the home of da cap splitters
Whip on 24?s watch it crawl like a caterpillar
I come wit' a toy, boy like a Happy Meal
And you's a muthafuckin' duck, Daffy Dill
I'm from the school of hard knocks, where we scrap and kill
Pick the knife or gunner, you can get the package deal
I'm hot nigga, burnin' everything around me
I was lost for a minute took a while but I found me
The streets say I'm king but the game will never crown me
Realist nigga doin' it just ask the niggas 'round me
So you can't size me up or try to clown, a
Shark in the water jump in and I'ma drown ya
New Orleans nigga, gun out, I'ma down ya
Put niggas to sleep like a muthafuckin' downer
I'm a great white, you's a flounder
Fish and a bitch I tuna eveything around ya
U-Haul Gudda, movin' everything around ya
It's Young Money bitch
At the top is where they found us
[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]
Uhh, goons on deck
Marley don't shoot 'em
Silence on the gun
Watch a nigga mute 'em
The coach in the booth
Call me Jon Gruden
School these niggas, they all my students
All jokes aside, I ain't playin' wit'cha
The weed broke down, like a transmission
The choppa spin him 'round, like a ballerina
Bitch I'm still spittin' like I ate a jalape
