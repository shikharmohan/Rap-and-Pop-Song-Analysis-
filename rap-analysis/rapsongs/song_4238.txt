[Lil Wayne]
Uhhh, they wanna lock me up and throw away the key
I wanna pop em up and throw away the heat
I dont play and when I do I play for keeps
Im from the jungle where the lion eat the sheep
yeah bubba just came home from the penitentiary
when I see him Imma put him in a Bentley
Young Carter what it is, what it isnÃÂ¢€t
D Porter my sign say gone fishing
Imma wizard, pooof! my top missing
let the sky in and tell the b-tch kiss it
sip pink Mo, I drink pimp C
never put the cup down (never put the cup down)
b-tch Im from uptown
I say uptown
my lifes a nasty b-tch ask bus down
ask what now
and an ass never differs
Lil Weezy is ÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ dat nigga
[Chorus]
