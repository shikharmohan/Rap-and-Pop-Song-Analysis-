Hey! Look up baby, they write my name in the sky bitch. Don't forget the baby is what I tell the pilot. Don't forget the liquor store is what I tell the driver, Twenty dutchmasters and straight level vodka. I can pedal backwards and still move forward. Look under the mattress, ya might find four of 'em. I can go though the atlas without tourin, I can fuck an actress and never been in movies, chea. I'm a cutie, An offspring of mamas beauty. I did overtime, I took papas duty. I'm a man in every sense, I got cents, Since I got rich I got tints on every Bent
Since I know tension come out them like vents. I vent, and show no relent, money well spent. I'm a hell raiser, Blaze a L Right in front of the laws. I'm tougher than yall. Never really had a pop, so I never had to check in. But I get enough checks, I fuck around and check him. Look, check him out, these is Evisus, America ain't even let them out (ha ha)
I'm feeling great, I'm steppin out
Take ten out, Brrraatt, chest is out. And I don't leave paraplegics
I squeeze it, Until I see ya spirit rise with my own eyes nigga.
I'm on mine nigga,I got this like a bitch got time nigga. And I'm the dime type. And I'm walkin in the lime light, still like lime.
They talkin in hindsight, I'm right now.I pull up on ya shawty like SKKRRR. Tryna hop up in this Maybach, I walk way back girl
Come up out that gear asap girl.
Whisper in ya ear this Wayne pussy, say it back girl. Now she in the whip with homes, He listenin to the same songs I fucked her on. yea. I lay back, I'm comfortable, yea. Weezy baby boy, lazy boy, yea. I did my service in the Navy, now I'm just a veteran, they forever pay me.
Dig me like a shovel, Mama I'm a rebel. I come from under that rock and turned into a pebble. Baby I'm trouble, so turn up the treble.
Ya say it's clever, I call it whateva.
