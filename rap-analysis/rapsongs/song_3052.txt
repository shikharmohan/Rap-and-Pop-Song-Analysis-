Tha world is mine nigga get back
Don't fuck with my stack the gage is racked
About to drop the bomb I'm they motherfuckin' don
Big fish in a small pond
Now tha feds wanna throw their book at the crook
But I shook they worm and they hook
Guppies hold they breath, they wanna miss me when I'm tipsey
Runnin' everything, Westside of the Mississippi
It's the unseen pullin' strings wit my pinky ring
We got your woman, pucker up
FO we fuck her up
Bow down before I make a phone call
Got 25 niggaz runnin' up on y'all
Fo the cheese we want them keys
Everybody freeze on ya knees, butt naked please
Before any of you guppies get heart
Nigga rewind my part bo' and
  (Bow down)
When I come to yo' town
  (Bow down)
When I'm westward bound
  (Bow down)
'Cuz I ain't no hater like you, bow down
To a nigga that's greater than you
I take ten steps and I draw
Now who's dissin' the mad ass Inglewood addition
I bust like a pimple, my mind is illmental
The Westside connects with me and South Central
And a drag from tha zig zag, can't fuck with the
Philly's holdin' down tha wild west like a kid they call Billy
Once again it's Mack 10, the gold crown holda
Strong as a Coca-Cola, with a crome pistola
Now who wanna fuss so I can buss when I cuss
My look bring you fear with gear deom the Surplus
Since a teen I chased tha green, the crack scene King
Lolos Cornishes and Bagguetts on my pieces
So recognize these real G's, take the cheese
The Westside connection, keep it rollin' like gold D's
Three Wheelin' and Dealin' is like tha California style
But in tha mean while in my town you got to bow
  (Bow down)
When you come to my town
  (Bow down)
When I'm westward bound
  (Bow down)
Because I ain't no hater like you, bow down
To a nigga that's greater than you
Well it's that chuck wearin', still sportin' a Beanie
The shadiest nigga when the click, who want to see me
Guess I slide my locs on let
My khakis hang Westside Connect gang, Connect gang
Bing bing bang, run away, run away or get yo punk ass
Sprayed by this h double O to D to the S.T.A.
Fuck hidin' it I am gang related simple and plain
Which means I could give a fuck about you niggas in this rap game
Flashy niggas get stuck up, beat the fuck up when you come around
Keep the chain tucked from this zero zero's affiliated fucka
Like a studio lyricist, I'm real with this, talk the talk walk the walk
Dis me on Wax and I am tryin' to saw your whole fuckin' head off nigga
I'm platium bond so bitch shut up and nigga punk y'all yahh
Could kiss my converse like sh'o nuff
  (Bow down)
When I come to yo' town
  (Bow down)
When I'm westward bound
  (Bow down)
'Cuz I ain't no hater like you, bow down
To a nigga that's greater than you
  (Bow down)
When you come to our town
  (Bow down)
When we westward bound
  (Bow down)
'Cuz we ain't no haters like you, bow down
To some niggas that's greater than you
Yea, tell you sumthin'
Gangstas make the world go round
So you ain't got tha clown
But if you livin' on tha west side of yo' town
Make them other fool's bow down
Westside connects, the world belongs to us
Bow down, bow down
Bow down
 (Bow down)
When you come to our town
  (Bow down)
When we westward bound
  (Bow down)
'Cuz we ain't no haters like you, bow down
To some niggas that's greater than you
