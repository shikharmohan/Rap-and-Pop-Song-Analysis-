It's time for me
I never rhyme for free
at least pay attention
you know, let your mind be free
I think by now everyone knows
my funk flows will ease the pain
because MCs we brain
make 'em nervous
here for your service
infer this
clear to any rapper that is wacka
I'll slap ya
I talk shit that's amazin'
the days spent
inside my crib producin' had me boostin' my confidence
now I will stomp some sense
into those numbskulls
I leave 'em dumb-dull
I thank you the listener
cause if it was up to me
if yall was girls
I'd be kissin' ya
and the brothers get phat pounds
and goin' round is phat pounds of indo
no brown
I puff sess at the rest
unless they have the bomb beta
and now my mom made a turnaround
she wasn't concerned & clowned
mostly,
now I get ends & my job is not pretend,
[CHORUS:]
"It doesn't phaze, I amaze wit my phrases, play this in your Jeep, so
your neighbors lose some sleep (I wanna thank you)..."
I wanna thank you
cause my dank grew & flourished
nourished ny hunger
sure, it's me indulgin'
never will I bullshit some other finna frame
if you're a beginner here's my name
DeL! myster, ya shyster
I'll heist your jewels & tolls & leave ya fooled
Moot,
I never get soot
my ends that I got last year will probably still get resooped
I know yall're sick'n tired of these weakassniggas makin' records
so just check what I delivers
I send shivers down ya spine
I'm incline to bind and put together clever conversation
cause I'm dope without the leather
whether or not, my spot is never taken
or forever breakin' on new rhymers
they flock around, wanna be down & two timers
I will design a flow that will remind ya
dumbasshoes and a path go
go to a spot where I know that the grass's sold,
[CHORUS:]
"I love to roll a fat stogie, if you're out there you can roll one too,
& listen only ( I wanna thank you, peace)...
