Alright boy, ah man
Give you your rights, here we go again
You have the right to remain silent
Hey Ish what's goin' on? Chill, chill it's cool
Give up the right to remain silent
Anything you say can and will be used against you
Whatever man, whatever
Do you understand each of these rights I've explained to you?
Oh, like I ever had rights, kid
Do you wish to give up the right to remain silent?
Hell yeah
So now let's let into in my pocket pack
Pummel and I epic black ethic lack, I walk again
You were shade gray ,come display
Mazes in black fire in the west
Shit is shakin' it's fly
I'm in lookies when I pushin' vinyl time
Up the forts, where I'm caught
And my thought to shakin' up a few loose
Now I let my cause shoo KRS one
'Cause we fade in and out, are you swingin' or coming?
I'm solid on this thought, this ain't livin'
It's heavy every set back, even when I was a shorty
Now we cross you and your foe, thrice
Check me in another place space enjoy
Nothing you could server could ever ace me, boy
Fat laces I'm out fat and no maybe's
That's right, baby
That's right, show you right, alright
That's right, show you right, alright
That's right, show you right, alright
I got Harlem on my mind, Darren on my back
Brooklyn in my blood and butters on the track
I got insect thoughts, catch the cool ways
Clouds of purple haze keep me in a daze
The jazz, the jive, the poetry
The style, the lingo, the bags of equality
Many different things tryin' to get to me
But in a world of hard rock, I keep my humility
The funkanaut from the kingdom of not
With galactic sure shot, they can't, won't, don't stop
Flock to the rhythm I bring
Sing songs call survival on the Mingus revival
Scored the bass hit with my bugged out clique
It's doodlebugm give me love for a visual script
Sip the groove juice, it's kinda rough
Sevens never bluff, I had enough, eleven
That's right, show you right, alright
That's right, show you right, alright
That's right, show you right, alright
In the east I rose, froze in the pose
Of a land diseased, flows that coolest summer breeze
Nikki did Kevin braids, we got four in the 'Lac
As we swoop at Warp Seven, holler don't crowd cats
'Cause look corpie is the color and butter he do it low
All you hear is poppers and rubber I'm sayin', oh
Man we keep it poppin' on hot day shit
I got the fish eggs droppin' any block you dip
And I dazzle that mood with the cool out fool
Easin' semi-swerve to the curb like the do
I'm fro, blow, you got that right
Groove with soul and I'm still spinnin'
Cross 110 and indicate 'em somethin' else
Blackest space, deepest sea
My shit's on natural high
The man can't put no thing on me
So dig me when my mind stretch out, it's astro black
Time reachin' end to end, nappy afro blue
We'd swoop and fight in, out the corners
Do my thang like you be with a nigga
That's right, show you right, alright
That's right, show you right, alright
That's right, show you right, alright
That's right, show you right, alright
That's right, show you right, alright
That's right, show you right, alright
That's right, show you right, alright
That's right, show you right, alright
That's right, show you right, alright
