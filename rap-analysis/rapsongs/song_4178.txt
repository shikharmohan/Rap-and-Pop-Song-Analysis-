Young Mullah Baby

You diss me everytime.

Im in love with you
But I cant be with you
Tomorrow Ill be back up on the first flight
right up out of town
young mullah baby
Hop back in my Spaceship
Girl I gotta drop your ass off
(oh oh eh eh)
Last night
ya we were spaced girl,
you love it
Girl I gotta take off
(oh oh eh eh)
Cause imma be here next week
So call your company
& take off
oh oh oeh oh oh eh
Cause she say "Wayne Wayne"
So she got me all impatient
Cry me a river
I can hear my conscious
while I say aloud
Boy you got a problem
and you aint foolin no one
but yourself
Your like a hot revolver
(hot revolver)
But you aint killin no one
but yourself
and so shes gone to party town
on her own
And you go by yourself
so all alone
I told her I can be with her
But I cant be with her
As much as she like me to
She like me too much
Thats the problem
"Oh my god" then
Shorty be whillin
and when I say I got to leave
You wouldn't believe
all of the things
that she'll do
and all of the things
that she'll say to make me stay
and I be like
"daaaaaammmmnnnnnn"
i am not going for foreverrr
I'll be back someday
But she wanna go with me to outer space
So we made love in the Milky Way
& then I send her on her way
Boy you got a problem
and you aint foolin no one
but yourself
Your like a hot revolver
But you aint killin no one
but yourself
And so shes gone to party town
on her own
And you go by yourself
so all alone
