Life is a roll like the dice and you know?
Life is a roll like the dice and you know?
Life is a roll like the dice and you know?
Do you wanna play? Now if you, base out and ace out
Ace is an ass out also an ass whip
You catch quick those who catch it most don't last it
Down on Doogan they rollin' two deep
So they ain't too sleep and crews creep
But they hard to beat bustin' out two jeeps
There's Tracy, tricky and trickin' chokin' nuff chicken
She's burnin' and when that chick is broke that bitch is
Stickin' up the block is for the hoe no another pro hoe
She pick pockets when she rocks it
It ain't no loot out on that hoe stroll on block five
Ya catch a fever and get no breather either beat it
Or break it to break it down through it I need it
Look for trips, yeah the triplets 'cause that's the hit click
And on down is a pick up 'cause it's a stick up on the freak tip
Just when you think things were looking messy
She lives six houses on the leafy her name is sexy
Hooked up by Becky true to the dice not new to the dice
Sexy dropped me off 456 Ci Lo Blvd right after she blew on the dice
123rd the block will splatter ya cap's catch ya they batter ya niggas
Stretch even scavengers breaking fool like Attica stolen glock
And he know holding spots from below promos for them G notes
Rolling rocks in kilos Ci-lo is the set up poppy's rockin'
And poppin' ya 123rd kids fuck up bank jacking like Joshua
Snake what wakeup or bake up pay up or break up
You're on the block rocked needin' three bitches ta shake up
Pimpin' ain't easy but if ya mac you'll be the largest
So if he asses out he got no hoes just three new charges ass
And face up in the cut look who dodges wait the case is open
And shut fuck garages and everyone on the strip is more than
One time offenders and they trusting the roll like they trustin' public
Defenders you see 'em don't want to be 'em hope Ci-lo free 'em
I'm schemin' a fuckin' demon after per diem I'm leaving
Sometimes this evening, yeah in the p.m.
Not even wit' attitude rude cause fool I'm geein' a crafter after a billing
Not asking on ya the master mackin' a million tax-free from this corner
