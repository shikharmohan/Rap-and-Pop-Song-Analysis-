Yo, I just don't understand
Lately, it seems like, I don't know
It just seems like, it seems like
Everybody wants
My style, my life, my blood
My shoes, my clothes, my gear
My watch, my rings, my chain
My cars, my money, my home
My body, my sweat, my tears
My power, my fame, my strength
My shit, my this, my that
Bitches, please
If you don't stop, someone's gonna find your ass dead
(This is a warning)
Someone's gonna poison your food
(This is a warning)
Someone's puttin' tags on your toes
(This is a warning)
Someone better pray for you
(This is a warning)
Someone's gonna get your keys
(This is a warning)
Someone's gonna open your door
(This is a warning)
Someone's gonna creep in your house
(This is a warning)
And put the straight in your mouth
This is a woman's threat
(This is a woman's)
Have you ever heard the story
About the mafia tip?
See Big Poppa was shot
A long, long, long, long time ago
And when he was killed
He left me with the throne
And now it seems like
Everyone wants my blood
If you don't stop, someone's gonna find your ass dead
(This is a warning)
Someone's gonna poison your food
(This is a warning)
Someone's puttin' tags on your toes
(This is a warning)
Someone better pray for you
(This is a warning)
Someone's gonna get your keys
(This is a warning)
Someone's gonna open your door
(This is a warning)
Someone's gonna creep in your house
(This is a warning)
And put the straight in your mouth
Don't stop, no no
You'll be sorry
Keep doin' it, you'll see
You'll be cryin'
I know, whatchu doin'
'Cause I'm watchin'
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
