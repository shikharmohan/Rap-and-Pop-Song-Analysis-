I need you, I got to have you
Yeah, whatever
I was sitting at the bar
When this real horny guy came over
He said, "Won't you let me take you
On a ride in my Range Rover?"
I said, "You can't be serious
My Bentley's right outside
And plus your breath smells
Like shit anyway"
Oh, I need you, oh
I gotta have you, oh
Just wanna touch you, oh
I need your love, yeah
Right now
Everybody's on the dance floor
And this fool is still behind me
I am dipping through the crowd now
Hoping that he doesn't find me
He said, "Baby, where you going?
Lil' Kim, I love you"
Then he grabbed me by the hand
And dipped my body to the ground
And said
ÃÂ­
I need you, oh
Gotta have you, oh
Just wanna touch you, oh
I need your love
Right now
See the party, don't stop till the casket drop
Like a six double O with the plastic top
Damn, is that all you've got?
Baby, give it one more shot
Got a body like what, what, what
Watch me shake my butt, butt, butt
Like it when you sing that song, oh
I know you wanna see my thong
I need you, oh
I want you, oh
Just wanna touch you, oh
I need your love, yeah
Right now
Right now, right now
I need your love, baby
I need your love
I want your love
