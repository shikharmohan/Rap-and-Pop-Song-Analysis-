Are you ready?
Yo light one, ignite one, draw me like the Buddha
You say I'm the joint, but you can call me hooda
Computer, wizard, the butcher of scissors
Cut me up and spark and roll me up, like a blizzard
Dwellin' your cells up, lungs start to swell up
Your pipe's gettin' crowded, yo just forget about it
Me, is potent, so bring an opponent
You could suck on it, shit I know you wanted to
Feel the effects of the high
I know you feel the effects of the high
Wanna feel the effects of the high, brother?
B-Real, light another
I'm smoked out, not on a menthol cigarette
How could you figure, or even, consider that
I'm, a weak seed, no, I'm the humble weed
[Incomprehensible], hash spliff this tweed
Actin' type of stylin', how do you spell it?
Take a hit from outta New York into Phillie
Hit some Visine, so the smoke can let out
Now do you really think you can take the red out and
Feel the effects of the high
I know you feel the effects of the high
Wanna feel the effects of the high, brother?
B-Real, light another
Spliff, aiyya, get on by ya, why ya
Why ya, want to, turn off the fire?
You can't get higher, when you turn me off and
Aiyyo, pussy stop coughin'
You're wastin the lingo, soon all the sack's gone
He'll take this bounty rhyme for you to stack on
Anyway you have it, you love me like Mary Jane
Or a 40 to the head, like my brother Kenny Wayne
You need to inhale, musical paraphen'
Yes musical, Muggs fixed the trend ah, just like a head
Brain cells get lit, but I'm the joint you can't grip
Through, your finger, I'll start to sting ya
So just hear my words linger and
Feel the effects of the high
I know you feel the effects of the high
Wanna feel the effects of the high, brother?
Yo Muggs, light another
Put me in the bamboo, with just a tape deck
And the white brother, rewinds the cassette
Was it, because it's funky that ya loves it?
Here's another lyric, go puff it
Don't choke off, the hype or croak off
When you blow the smoke off, hold until I get off
Or turn off the fat joint, wanna hit that joint
Here is the flat point, I rob it at gun point
I'm, the High Times, you get through my rhymes
Suck on the pipeline, sit back and recline
You gotta suck on, the fattie so come on and
Feel the effects of the high
I know you feel the effects of the high
Wanna feel the effects of the high, brother?
I'll just, light another
Feel the effects of the high
I know you feel the effects of the high
Wanna feel the effects of the high, brother?
Yo, light another
You wanna feel the effects of the high?
You wanna feel the effects of the high?
Wanna feel the effects of the high, brother?
Aiyyo, light another
Feel the effects of the high?
Can you feel the effects of the high? Can you feel it?
I feel the effects of the high yo can you feel it?
Yo light that motherfucker up man
I know you feel it
