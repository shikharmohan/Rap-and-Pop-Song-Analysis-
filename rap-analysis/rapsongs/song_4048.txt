Like i got 'er.
Gunz it's yo turn, and you are the driver.
And whateva' ya lost.
All you do is follow.
The roadsigns lead you to a gold mind.
How do I know?
It cause I just moved.
Gotta new crib on Goldmind Avenue.
So that's why I got this rich boy attitude.
You probly see me in the Caddy, with some D's
on that bitch.
Riding down Goldmind Avenue.
In the lane like l'm goin' get a Allie Oupe.
Oops, that was a coupe.
Pass yo' ass like lightning's flash.
Cut the light down now and turn me to a darkchild.
My thoughts fall, my eyelids are scattered.
And we are Young Money, but age doesn't matter.
