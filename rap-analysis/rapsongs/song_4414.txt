Verse 1
shawty baddder than a three and oh
keep playin and imma eat her like a peta roll
im just sayin with my love i can feed her soul
two day get a way and we aint need our clothes
we at the pool and she lookin like a centerfold
two tatoos and and she sayin she gettin plenty more
she got indian in her family seminole
me and shawty go together like chemicals
and she get mad when i call other women hoes
you send her rolls i pick some flowers and send her those
tall glass of merlow get her in the mold 
two tall galsses of merlow get her out her robe
i whisper in here ear then lick around her lobe 
and when she check her watch it's never time to go
and with her brain she said she make the honor roll
and when i came she called me like the common cold
Chorus
da damn you the shit 
and i'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
and i don't really know how to handle this shit
but tonight its moonlight and candles and shit
