oh. oh. oh. 
i been on my grind for a while now 
time to attack now
lean in the low in the background 
can't stop my hustle it's for life 
gotta get that money 
i won't let no one put me in a box i'm gon fight my way to top
things ain't goin right you need a lil' kim in ya life 
[chorus] 
i'm that light when you can't see 
i'm that air when you can't breathe
i'm that, im that one that you cant leave
i'm ya voice when you can't speak 
i'm ya your respirator
i'm ya high when you feel low 
i'm that strength when you feel weak 
i'm the truth when you don't believe 
i'm the blood that your heart beats 
i'm ya your respirator
if you feel me go oh-la-he-ho 
if you hear me go oh-ho-no-ma-ha-lo-eh 
people sweated on lil' kim 
but i'm not what they think i am 
instead of hatin on what you see 
come get to know me
i'm done with playin by the same ol rules 
ya girl over here makin major moves 
sick & tired of the same ol dudes 
i smell new money
i know i like to dance sleezy 
no but that don't mean that i'm easy 
first he gotta know how to please me & i'll be there if he needs me 
but i won't let no man put me in a box
i'm gon fight my way to the top 
things ain't goin right
he need a lil' kim in his life 
[chorus] 
i'm that light when you can't see 
i'm that air when you can't breathe 
i'm that, im that one that you cant leave 
i'm ya voice when you can't speak 
i'm ya your respirator 
i'm ya high when you feel low 
i'm ya strength when you feel weak 
i'm the truth when you don't believe 
i'm the blood that your heart beats 
i'm ya your respirator 
[verse 3] 
if you feel me go oh-la-he-ho 
if you hear me go oh-ho-no-ma-ha-lo-eh 
if you feel me go oh-la-he-ho 
to all my people across the world who need the life support 
then i'm ya girl it's a jungle in these streets 
don't let em get you cuz i been through the same ol things 
i know it's hard to get out the game dealin wit the hurt & pain 
i'm ridin wit you i know everyday is a struggle tryna get by 
don't want the trouble but if you touch a piece of my puzzle 
you gon get a piece of my muzzle cuz i don't let no one put me in a box
i'm gon fight my way to the top 
things ain't goin right 
you need a lil' kim in ya life 
[chorus] 
i'm that light when you can't see 
i'm that air when you can't breathe 
i'm that, im that one that you cant leave
i'm ya voice when you can't speak
i'm ya your respirator
i'm ya high when you feel low
i'm ya strength when you feel weak 
i'm the truth when you don't believe 
i'm the blood that your heart beats
i'm ya your respirator
