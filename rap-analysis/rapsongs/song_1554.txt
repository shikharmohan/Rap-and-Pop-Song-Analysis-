Check this out
All right its goin' down like this right here
You push you pay
Know what I'm sayin'? Everythin' counts, the trips you pay double
Keep your back straight and count them out loud
Come on, come on
Fifty in the clip get big get big
Fifty in the clip get big get big
Fifty in the clip get big get big
On the palms
On the fingertips
On the wrists
On the fists
Fifty in the clip get big get big
Fifty in the clip get big get big
Fifty in the clip get big get big
On the palms
On the fingertips
On the wood
On the bricks
Jumpin ropes, doin' gigs, basic drills with the stick
Fifty push-ups in the clip on the fists and the wrists
Gettin' swollen on the block, liftin' weights at the gym
Take the kids to the park do some techniques with them
Throw that hood, work that cross, stick your moves, tap that jaw
Tiger claw, lion paw, iron pawn can't be solved
Life is hard on the block, put your heart on the spot
You gon' ride or your not?
Brawn first, get the drop
Pay me
That's head crack boy
That fever got nottin' on that
Stay away from the corners
'N trace your burner, you heard me?
Gettin' big with the click, keep it tight like a fist
Everybody hit the deck nigga four, five, six
Add it up, hit the block, no search add it up
Skinny niggas gettin' guts, sisters too, get the needs of fight no girl Push-ups R.B.G's fifty-fifty let me see what you got
Nigga don't just watch me do it with me
You can do it through your breath from your gut not your chest
Push 'em out make them count go all-out count them out nigga
Four, five, six, look at that boy
Go together just like red black and green boy
You lookin' at Fred, Huey, and George right there
Word up, time to pay up
Put your muscle where your mouth is, get big count them out
