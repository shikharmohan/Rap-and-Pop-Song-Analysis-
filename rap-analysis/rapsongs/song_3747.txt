Up in the Bronx where the people are fresh
There was one DJ who had to pass the test
And now he's down by law and he's ready to play
That's right y'all his name is AJ
Never gets nervous when he cuts the beat
He gives top notch service in the clutch on the street
A complete elite treat that can't be beat
'Cause AJ never knew the agony of defeat, sing
AJ, I wanna see you
AJ, I wanna see you
AJ, I wanna see you
AJ

And now he's down with the king and we could never be whack
So just kick off you shoes and relax your feet
And just rock to the rhythms of the Kurtis Blow beat
