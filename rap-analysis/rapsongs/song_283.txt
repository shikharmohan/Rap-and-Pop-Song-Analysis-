Since the last time,  since the last time
It's been two years since we rock stages together
We covered bases together and whether we all agreed or not
20/20 vision is hindsight and now we got that so we done got back
Some of our soldiers have fallen, so many years of toiling
Touring, tears falling, naw pouring jaded from the industries
Jabs a lil' slower like Muhammad Ali but still we able to last
So we go in the studio, it felt new but yet in a good way
It felt old routines, we did came back so lucid, we was boosted
We juiced it and came up with some tracks that's stupid
And people responded to 'em, heads on the blocks
With locks and baggie jeans, the whole scene was fond to 'em
And how we got the labels kissing our hind parts
We desired art and never sold out for the high chart positions
I have been a thousand places
Seen a million faces since the last time
(Since the last time)
I have been a thousand places
Seen a million faces since the last time
(Since the last time)
Many rap groups attempt to latch to the popular cultures statutes
And thus they detach their roots from the soil that kept them loose
And made what they delivered so true
There's a desert waste land of past artists that's so cruel
Feeling thrown out like woody in toy story two
And yo we felt that but let me tell you Satan, he dealt that
I think it's time to give him his deck back, c'mon now
I have been a thousand places
Seen a million faces since the last time
(Since the last time)
I have been a thousand places
Seen a million faces since the last time
(Since the last time)
Since the last time
