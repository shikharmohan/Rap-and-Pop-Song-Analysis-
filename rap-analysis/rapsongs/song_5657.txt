Yo yeah, yo yeah, yo yeah
Yo, yo, yeah, yeah
Black is, black is something to laugh about
Black is something to cry about
Black is serious, black is a feeling
Black is us the beautiful people
Yo yeah, yo yeah, yo yeah
That was when some of them bad niggas
Made beauty moving juju changes, the drum musics hum
Mojo vibrated and high jons screamed through the bloods
To no more hears the blood sounds, no more folk intercourses
And all the niggas listening acted visionaries
To dig my people, they acted
The ryhtms pulling their minds was one
And moved, moved, moved
Universe earth spirits firing the soil to destroy the evil unimage
Cleanse the waste from the cold lands
Until the cosmos was whole again
And the worlds had become nude
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yo yo, yeah
3:30 in the morning with not a sole in sight
We set for deep at a traffic light
Talking about how dumb and brainwashed
Some of our brothers and sisters are
While we wait for a green light to tell us when to go
