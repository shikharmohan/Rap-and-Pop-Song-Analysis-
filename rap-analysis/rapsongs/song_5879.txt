You 'bout to feel the chronicles of a bionical lyric
Lyrically splittin', dismissin'
I'm on a mission of just hittin'
Now it's written and kitten hittin' wit mittens
I'm missin', wishin' man listen
I glisten like sun and water while fishin'
Bust the move and then swerve
Serve words with nerve embedded I said it word
Damn, you nerd man, you heard
Comin' from the town of Illy and alleys are
Full of Phillies and Rallys suckers get
Silly as Sally and then found in alleys I'm rowdy, really
So here we go now
Holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me, flow
Never mixin' with trickin' brothers bitchin'
Over fixins that ain't fittin' to be hittin'
For nothin' splittin' things that's bitten'
And gettin' written' off
You're like a fatter bad bladder boy ya pissin' me off
Before you even started so what, so long
See you fly by my try, how else could I say it
When you play it try boom, bye, bye, bye, bye
Here we go now
Holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me, flow
Here we go now
Holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me, flow
The flow pro poetical with skills only
A vet'll know better know where's
The wetter flow that's on point like
Decimals manhandlin' new crews
Partyin' with the Zoo crew
Lookin' for the pink in poo poo
I thought you knew too stone style is of stamina
Jammin' ta while we plannin' ta jam
We bust plus we're the party
Amateur damager managin' damagin' mics
Men and even mannequins
You're a fan again now I wanna know whose the man again?
Naughty's back like vertebrates word to hey-a-ho
The way I show you pray I flow
Steady breakin' to the boogie so bang time
To slang bang and watch all the poo tang tangs hangs
Here we go now
Holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me, flow
Here we go now
Holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me, flow
Play and Kay'll break the body of a beat
The beat the break into boogie
Firm and fully chase bass lines like bullies
All we wanna know is if your body wanna party
It's nuff poo tang tang for everybody
So hip up and split up, get up
Get up your wit up souped up put your dukes up
No guts set up for sit ups, flip up, watch us rip up
Shakes shows until they fizz up
Rizz up like your with us if not zip up
You lip up, whip up
Hits with ransom's foul styles get and ones
We come back 'cause we heard
Hip hop needed another anthem
Black like Noah, in fact and for ya
If we was back in the days with the Drifters
We would've been known as the Flowers'
Bevin' these since the seventies
Find me so we went crazy in the eighties
So we won't kiss heinies in the nineties
Oops, the Naughty's troops
In sections of forties
So clap your hands and hold your shorty
I'm Naughty
Here we go now
Holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me, flow
Here we go now
Holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me, flow
Here we go now
Holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me, flow
Here we go now
Holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me, flow
