Ready
All praise due we comin' through real hard
Niggaz raisin' they right hand salutin' da God
Yo like a burnin' sensation of Henny on the first sip
Hot shit my nigga let me spit a verse quick
Work shit inward until my niggaz hurt shit
And plot elaborate schemes for monies niggaz worship
Beautiful like the pleasure of when I burst my first clip
At a nigga who sold me a brick that wasn't worth shit
Yo we bomb shit fire alarm shit
With my bitches who take packages under they armpit
Now we remain the imperial live niggaz
Who consistantly blackout and rep for them wild niggaz
Yo you incompatible snatch yo' collateral
Gun blunt you and rep for every thug capital
Diagonal vision niggaz seein shit on slant
Plant beatings on niggaz and celebrate a war chant
Diabolic how we manifest raw logic
Chronological time we bring niggaz the raw project
Hold fort and represent as the grand wizard
Street chronicle illustrate the bakin' of a bad blizzard
I got a spot for ya
With live niggaz who murder sloppier
Than all of the trenchcoat mafia yo
'Cause when you hear the sweet music playin'
It's like theme music for murder scenes
Like the Colorado slayin 'cause I don't give a fuck
Speedin like we racin' on the aqueduct
Black tinted out government truck
Curbside on niggaz leanin' just a little bit
Trunk trapp'd with smoke my bitch'll take a little hit
Fake niggaz could be the best actors
My bullets whiz so fast you feel the windshield factors
In the wrong place you get your wig peeled backwards
Get an ounce of the 'dro and steam a pack of Blackwoods
Ready for Busta Rhymes
He's the one we've all been waiting for forever
(Yeah, yeah, just feel what I feel niggaz)
Ready for Flipmode Squad
(Yeah, just reach up and just touch the sky niggaz)
They're the ones we've all, been waiting for, forever
(Now, hah, yeah, I try so hard)
(To just share that shit that I'm feelin')
Ready for Busta Rhymes
(All my niggaz just talk to me)
He's the one we've all, been waiting for, forever
(So powerful flipmode squad now)
Ready for Flipmode squad
(Yeah, new rulership)
All my niggaz just walk in line)
They're the ones we've all, been waiting for, forever
(Walk in line with me, talk to me now)
Welcome
We are now in the current state of the anarchy
We fight to survive niggaz
We fight to rule our own government
We livin' in a current state of no fuckin' government
Niggaz don't even know how to follow they own spirit
Lost niggaz
Unsure niggaz, insecure niggaz
Fuck that
Salute all our motherfuckers
All my niggaz ready to hold it down on the front line
We survived it niggaz, 2000
Time for the new bloodline to run shit
Enjoy the album
