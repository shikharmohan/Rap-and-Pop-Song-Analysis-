Aight, uhh, alright y'all slow down I'm trying
Aight, yo I I only took a little bit of Spanish you gotta
I, I hear what you're saying but yo, aight okay
Alright okay, alright okay okay, alright okay, I'm feeling you, okay
Alright okay, alright okay okay, alright okay, I'm feeling you yo
All my people in Brooklyn and you know we're hot, I say
We don't stop, the body rock
All my people in Queens and the land in between say we
Don't stop, the body rock
Shaolin and LI say you know we're fly, say we
Don't stop, the body rock
From the east to the west son we take it to the chest say we
Don't stop, the body rock
I'm in the lab with ab, I got the band they're fat
My man T A S H take it to your breastplate
It's the mighty Mos Def, complete the trilogy
Just shot myself a dime, see are you feeling me?
Son I'm wicked and nice when I'm on facility
Let me take a sec to review what I wrote
Mos Def and I sound par fresh, okay it's dope
Let's record this they gonna want this
And all area crew is gonna flaunt this
And when we step to the plate Pah it's flawless
My man T A S H with styles glory great
Great, great great, great great
Up next we got CaTash with that west coast rhyming
Bombing niggaz with the style as dangerous as mountain climbing
'Cause the Alkie words I'm spitting be twisting while you listening
Plus I'm in this motherfucker with the Likwit coalition
That'll leave you in position, twisted backwards like dough go
While you staring down my throat like, "Is he drunk or is he sober?"
Who knows, all I know is Tash got flows
And got the technique to get the ladies out of their clothes
I been overly exposed to the forty O's and chickens
So I'ma keep it pumping 'til the beat stop kicking
Or 'til the plot thickens, 'cause this is how we do
CaTash Trophe, Mos Def, and the brother man
What's up Tash, hey yo, Tip can't call it
Sure as Mos is Def and you alkaholik
I'ma be surfing at, thing that's worth dealing
Hypodermically, shoot up your feeling
Figuratively, speaking of course now
Old and greediness, seeking it's course now
What we gonna do, eradicate them
Shoot them from the jam, they be diseased phlegm
Tash love, are you ready to rock the mic?
Q-Tip, are you ready to rock the mic
Mos def, are you ready to rock the mic?
We got the universal style that you got to like
And ain't nobody stepping up when we got the mic
So turn the AC up 'cause it's hot tonight
And 'til the bright early morn' we be rocking you all
Don't stop, the body rock
'Cause I'm next to flex, and I'm technically advanced
To turn you on like cybersex, so in less than two sec's
I blind MC's like Thomas Dolby with the Science that'll leave
They braincells frying slowly so slowly I flow and
Express written consent, from the under grounding niggaz
'Coast II Coast' I represent 'cause getting bent, I do
But I'm doper than Sherm plus the way I put it down
Could burn the perm off Big Worm, so peep this private screening
Of the last action hero that be freezing rappers dead in they tracks
Like Sub Zero 'cause Rico ain't no joke
I eat yo' flows and yo' beat up rappers even feel my presence
When I'm home with my feet up
Yo what you skied up or treed up?
Relax and pull a seat up, make your landlord turn the heat up
Got the opposition shook like Tiger Woods about to tee up
So niggaz no competition with the clear Mos Definition
MC's screaming now for years
Can't rhyme without their mom's permission
You just a young'un coming out, getting gassed to run your mouth
Wilding on the run about, Baby Pah you coming out
Barking that you want a 'bout but son you know the come about
When Mos Def blow up and, you don't, nothing
Don't you know nothing? My crew go hunting
We keep it on the norm then we transform som'ing
And while, we do it, you bounce to it
The cops wanna stop the Body Rock but don't do it
Dynomite like Jimmy J.J.
Swap down penny, somewhere in LA
Now we got to bond like Voltron
Tash you the bomb, Mos you the won ton
Q will pick the lead, I must drop on thee
A B S, I bust down, facility
T R A C T is the MC
It's the LL, inside the place to be
Tash Love, are you ready to rock the mic?
Q-Tip, are you ready to rock the mic
Mos Def, are you ready to rock the mic?
We got the universal brothers that you got to like
Now ain't nobody stepping up when we got the mic
So turn your AC up 'cause it's hot tonight!
And 'til the bright early morn' we'll be rocking you all
Don't stop, the body rock
All my people out in Queens that know you're hot, you say
Don't stop, the body rock
All my people out in Brooklyn and you know we're hot, say
Don't stop, the body Rock
Shaolin to LI and you know we're fly, said
Don't stop, the body rock
All the people on the Greens and the land in between said
Don't stop, the body rock, no stopping, no stopping
Out in Jersey, no stopping
Philadelpi I, no stopping
Chi Town getting down, the playgrounds
Detroit you say, no stopping
In Cali, no stopping
And the great VA, no stopping, it says
It said the Brooklyn town, no stopping
And the Boogie Down, no stopping
LI and Queens, no stopping
And you see Medina Greens, no stopping
You know we, Lyricist Lounge, no stopping
And my man Abstract, no stopping
Cause see we never the wack, no stopping
Don't stop, the body bock, don't stop
