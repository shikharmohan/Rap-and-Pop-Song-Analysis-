Ayo, Ice, man
I'm working on this term paper for college
What's the First Amendment?
Freedom of Speech, that's some motherfucking bullshit
You say the wrong thing, they'll lock your ass up quick
The FCC says 'Profanity, no airplay"
They can suck my dick while I take a shit all day
Think I give a fuck about some silly bitch named Gore?
Yo, PMRC, here we go, raw
Yo, Tip, what's the matter? You ain't getting no dick?
You're bitching about rock 'n' roll
That's censorship, dumb bitch
The Constitution says we all got a right to speak
Say what we want, Tip, your argument is weak
Censor records, TV, school books too
And who decides what's right to hear? You?
Hey, PMRC, you stupid fucking assholes
The sticker on the record is what makes 'em sell gold
Can't you see, you alcoholic idiots
The more you try to suppress us, the larger we get?
(You have the right to remain silent)
Fuck that right, I want the right to talk
I want the right to speak, I want the right to walk
Where I wanna yell and I'm gonna
Tell and rebel every time I'm on a
Microphone on the stage, cold illing
The knowledge I drop will be heard by millions
We ain't the problems, we ain't the villains
It's the suckers depriving the truth from our children
You can't hide the fact, Jack
There's violence in the streets every day
Any fool can recognize that
But you try to lie and lie
And say America's some motherfucking apple pie
Yo, you gotta be high to believe that
You're gonna change the world by a sticker on a record sleeve
'Cos once you take away my right to speak
Everybody in the world's up shit creek
Let me tell you about down south
Where a motherfucker might as well not even have a mouth
Columbus, Georgia, said they'd lock me up
If I got on the stage in my show and said 'Fuck'
So I thought for a minute and said no
I wasn't even gonna do a damned show
'Cos for me to change my words from my rhymes
Is never gonna happen 'cos there's no sellouts on mine
But I vowed to get those motherfuckers one day
They even arrested Bobby Brown and Cool J
Yo, they got theirs coming 'cos I'm mad and I'm gunning
Homeboys and there's no running
I'm gonna tell you how I feel about you
No bull, no lies, no slack, just straight fact
Columbus, Georgia, you can suck my dick
You ain't nothing but a piece of fucking shit
On the damned map
Freedom of Speech, let 'em take it from me
Next they'll take it from you, then what you gonna do?
Let 'em censor books, let 'em censor art
PMRC, this is where the witch hunt starts
You'll censor what we see, we read, we hear, we learn
The books will burn
You better think it out
We should be able to say anything
Our lungs were meant to shout
Say what we feel, yell out what's real
Even though it may not bring mass appeal
Your opinion is yours, my opinion is mine
If you don't like what I'm saying, fine
But don't close it, always keep an open mind
A man who fails to listen is blind
We only got one right left in the world today
Let me have it or throw The Constitution away
What they're trying to do with radio
With this, uh, McCarron-Walter? Act and a lot of other ways
Is start by saying that they're protecting the public
From wicked rock bands or girlie magazines or whatever
But if you follow the chain of dominoes that falls down
What they're really trying to do is shut off
Our access to information itself
If they can't do it by law
They know there's other ways to do it
