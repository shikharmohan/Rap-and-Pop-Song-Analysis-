Uhh, dedicated to all the underdogs, knahmtalkinbout?
Muthafuckas told me I wasn't gon' be shit
Told me I was gon' be able to do this rap shit
Knahmtalkinbout? My own family talked down on me, knahmsayin?
You can't let no bitch shatter yo' dreams
It might not be all bad as it first seems
You might not have all the things you need, yeah
But all you got to do is believe
I got to get my money, yeah
I got to get my money, yeah
You got to get yo' money, yeah
I got to get my money, yeah
Man, I refuse to let these bitches take away my pride
Them hoes can lock my body up but they can't lock my mind
See I'm a young street flame, I got them fire eyes
I mean that Eyes of Fire, the Tiger, the Black Pride
I call some women bitches and I call some women whores
A bitch a dirty boar, a hoe open up the pussy store
Now what's the difference between the two? Man, I just told you that
But that don't mean that every woman I know is down with that
If you a bitch and wanna switch, it ain't too late to change
It's all about how you carry yo'self and how you handle thangs
Some say that hoes and pimps is born, I don't believe that shit
'Cause anytime you wanna stop, it ain't too late to quit
Just 'cause you sold your body don't mean you a hoe for life
I got to speak it right for all the ones that paid the price
But if ya in it to win it, go head and live the life
But baby, if you ain't in it, you still can do it right
You can't let no bitch shatter yo' dreams
It might not be all bad as it first seems
You might not have all the things you need, yeah
But all you got to do is believe
I got to get my money, yeah
I got to get my money, oh ho
You got to get yo' money, yeah
I got to get my money
To all the babies havin' babies on ya' own
I know you feelin' fucked up and feelin' all alone
I know ya people tellin' you, "Ya fucked up your life"
Ya only fucked up if you lay down and don't continue to fight
And to the young nigga out there tryna sell dope
I know your family fucked up and it's your last rope
In your heart, I know ya cold with this rhyme shit
But ain't nuttin' hap'nin' but this 20's and this dime shit
And you the daddy with lil' mama that's 'bout to have the baby
You wanna own ya team but niggaz tellin' you ya crazy
What you thankin'? You too young to have a family
But all the moves ya makin', look like you a man to me
When you get caught up, man, them niggaz ain't gon' ride witchu
But get down with that girl and she gon' keep it live witchu
But she gon' help ya put your money up and save somethin'
'Cause right now ya run it, th'ew it back and you ain't made nuttin'
It's time to change sumthin'
You can't let no bitch shatter yo' dreams
It might not be all bad as it first seems
You might not have all the things you need, yeah
But all you got to do is believe
I got to get my money, yeah
I got to get my money, oh oh
You got to get yo' money, yeah
I got to get my money
If you a ballplayer, man, go 'head and play ball
Don't let nobody steal your dream if you ain't came to fall
I know they say, "It ain't enough room in the NBA"
You tell them haters save that bullshit for another day
If you a sanger, lil' mama, go 'head and sang ya song
Them hoes say, "You ain't gon' make it", the funky bitch is wrong
You ain't got to get butt-naked on stage in a thong
Just sang your records to show the people you got it goin' on
I see a whole lotta motherfuckers come and go
I know young niggas sold they soul for the dirty dough
They want a rapper, I understand, go 'head and chase ya dream
But chase to hog it up, the lawyer end up like a fiend
Some people gay, what can I say? The only judge is God
But don't be shame and try to hide 'cause then you livin' fraud
'Cause everythang done in the dark, gon' come to the light
So do yo' thang, 'cause can't no man tell you what's wrong or right
Right, right, right, right
So do yo' thang, 'cause can't no man tell you what's wrong or right
