{I just want you to relax
Ease into it}
Baby slow down, just take your time
You and me gonna be here for a while, okay
Baby don't rush this, take your time
You and me gonna be here for a while, okay
I got so much that I want to do
I just wanna be close to you, okay
I got so much that I want to do
But I can show you better than I can say
And don't wanna be no where but here
No where in this atmosphere
Stratosphere, ionosphere
Ain't no sphere that's bright like here
Don't wanna be no where but here
No where in this atmosphere
