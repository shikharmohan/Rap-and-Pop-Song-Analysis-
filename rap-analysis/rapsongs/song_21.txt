The business is entertainment
And what entertain the customers is the sight of blood
Cam, I mean, I was bein' nice to him, okay, I'll get him
You *** should worship the ground I walk on
I make mills off the tracks I talk on, it's kingpin
50, don't call me, ***, I don't wanna talk it out
The *** will hit your leg, go on and walk it out
I see it clear, you tryin' to sabotage Jimmy
See what happens when you talk after sippin' the Henny?
I'll send Haitian *** at you, yeah, sak pase
Zoe pound ***, they don't play
Buck *** *** on camera and it's okay
'Cause my money make my lawyers make the *** go away
Attempted ***, get a year on probation
Cam, are you clear what you facin'?
You must ain't hear me, I done told you, I'm a boss
I'm eatin' good but I ain't chubby like Ricky Ross
Word on the street is that 50's not Jay
And Cam better stay out of his way
Everything's cooler than a fan till you rolled on
Have you in the I.C.U., tryin' to hold on
*** in the waitin' room, been waitin' so long
Till they hear the flat line, the doc say, he's gone, he's gone
That's *** up
When they say he's gone
He dead
Well, he knew that could happen, *** with the kid
This is graveyard music right here, ya dig?
This is not competition, this is ***
Career endin', mind bendin', Southside, ya finished
Now look, *** laughin' at Cam, down on Lennox
They heard what he did but they don't know why he did it
I have eighty of them boys with black flags
Come through with black ***
And have you *** zipped up in black bags
For a second he was hot, now he cold
I apply pressure on *** until they fold
But never mind me, man, that's just how I be
The game got me trained, they call me the hustle man
And like fame, my style will live forever
They thought I crossover 'cause they don't know no better
I think they think I'm laxed now 'cause I got the cheddar
Till I return back ***, trust me, it's nothin'
Everything's cooler than a fan till you rolled on
Have you in the I.C.U., tryin' to hold on
*** in the waitin' room, been waitin' so long
Till they hear the flat line, the doc say, he's gone, he's gone
When they say he's gone
It shouldn't have to be like this, man
Dipset, Cam, stay up, I'm not gonna destroy Dipset
Just gotta make changes, from now on, Jimmy's the boss of Dipset
And Juelz is the capo, he's gone
Cam's demoted to soldier, we like Jimmy better anyway
Ballin', come on, man
What's the last Cam joint you liked?
Computers computin', boogity, boobity, he's gone
Cameron, you better learn how to talk to me, oh
