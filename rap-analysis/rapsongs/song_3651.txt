We keep showin' you and showin' you and showin' you
This is what it is
We gon' flow with you, you know it's true, hip-hop
This is what it is
We keep showin' you and showin' you and showin' you
This is what it is
We gon' flow with you, you know it's true, hip-hop
This is what it is
A man once said that the streets are watchin' us
If this be the truth we must keep hip-hop in us
They'll never topple us, you done heard them thugs
Now, it's time to hear from the philosophers
Buildings fallin', employment stallin' us
Now, it's time, the future is callin' us
Television is boring us, radio is whorin' us
Lurin' us with a chorus plus, you can't even trust
The church, the synagogue, they all deceivin' us
It's time to believe in us
To believe in a hip-hop lifestyle that agrees with us
No squeeze or bust, bo, bo, you find ease with us
The DJ's, the MC's is us
The ice we've seen enough
It's time for hip-hop and this is what it is
We keep showin' you and showin' you and showin' you
This is what it is
We gon' flow with you, you know it's true, hip-hop
This is what it is
We keep showin' you and showin' you and showin' you
This is what it is
We gon' flow with you, you know it's true, hip-hop
This is what it is
You know we lead a movement
It's called 'I am hip-hop'
Cats debate about it, but I am hip-hop
Cats wanna talk about but I am hip-hop
My cats in New York like "I am hip-hop"
My cats in Atlanta like "I am hip-hop"
Cats in Miami like "I am hip-hop"
Chi-Town like "I am hip-hop"
All over L.A., "I am hip-hop"
Keep the rawness, the gutter the real
The movement's growin' like corn in the field
KRS-One was born with the steel
I'm on top of my game like Shaquille O'Neal
No surprises, hip-hop come in all sizes
Now, watch as KRS rises up, up, up, up and away
Now, you critics mouth shut, got nothin' to say
And that's good for the kids, 'cause hip-hop
This is what it is
We keep showin' you and showin' you and showin' you
This is what it is
We gon' flow with you, you know it's true, hip-hop
This is what it is
We keep showin' you and showin' you and showin' you
This is what it is
We gon' flow with you, you know it's true, hip-hop
This is what it is
Stay focused, focused
Stay focused oh, oh
Yeah, uh-huh, focused
Yo, look, look, this is what it is
Y'all need to stop confusin' the kids
Makin' 'em think you gotta do a bid to be hip-hop
Man that ain't it
Rob a nigga, kill a nigga, man that ain't shit
How you figure, how murder make you hip?
You need to hop to the bookstore and look for Kris
Anything by KRS-One
Will lead you to peace, to love, to unity and havin' fun
Y'all know but some of y'all don't
And some of y'all won't that's why only some of y'all dope
The rest of y'all, food for the Gods
I eat everything but Pop's 'cause I don't eat lard
We keep showin' you and showin' you and showin' you
This is what it is
We gon' flow with you, you know it's true, hip-hop
This is what it is
We keep showin' you and showin' you and showin' you
This is what it is
We gon' flow with you, you know it's true, hip-hop
This is what it is, is
