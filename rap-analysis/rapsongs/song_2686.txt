It's the motherfucking B-R-O-W-N, whoa
Slow your roll niggas
It's about to go down my niggas
I'm outta control still
Bubble slow and low in the rov and
Spit stick flow I'm a problem niggas
Y'all can't fuck with Boog, I'm too hood
F-B the rap Angelina Jolie, dog
Everything from Carty to Chloe Little
Posha here little Filth Mart there
Nigga, it's not a game on the mic I'm insane
Snatch back my lane I'm a Vince Carter this
Brown pimp the game and still reign
Since the days of Kane numb 'em like cocaine
Niggas, uh huh, nigga read my lips
Uh huh, we won't miss

Hit by the Neptunes
Throw in that bass
Yeah, y'all niggas got a problem this year
I'm focused man
From my blue and grey Pradas
Rov and 6-4, I'm the loc'est man
Hotter than dope man niggas
I'm different dog I'm outta bitches reach
Y'all bitches take heed this bitch is deep
One lesson learned ain't nothing sweet
I, body a broad I don't play with these broads
Whoa, y'all broads be killing me with that chatter
I go at one bitch the rest of y'all don't matter
Fuck around like y'all want it with Brown
My knuckle game vicious, I'm shutting shit down niggas

Since a little young broad
I been spitting this flame
Smack the shit out one y'all broads
Y'all mention Fox name
Lord, it's a shame I'm so ahead of this game
And you know she's a hot bitch
When they dirty your name
Give a bitch the 5 minutes of fame
Lot of broads ain't acting the same
Not that I knew 'em but I passed them
On a couple of corners racking their brain
And the 2 top bitches kind of slid off they game
And at the time I was going through my personal pain
Them the sorta things kind of drive you insane
Bitch betta thank God you slid in the game
But the King Bitch is back, man it's a wrap
