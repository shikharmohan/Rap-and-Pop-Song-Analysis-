Yo what up? It's Paul, got ten minutes each
I'm here to get this piece to redo it or there's one we left for you
Whatever you, whatever you said, I agree
That's why I was to get tore up on I am I be, that rhymed
Umm, quest Que C? Yo, man they dissed me in the
Source man they gave me no credit for my songs
For the Slick Rick stuff gave credit for songs I did
That's a diss, I'm mad man, I hate, and I hate
And you can quote me and you can record this
And put this on a record I hate them, I hate them
And I'm ma get them, if it's the last thing I do
Anyway, hope you have a pleasant day, peace
