[Hook:]
I bet you ain't never seen 26's on a range
Iced out VVS stones and a chain
She Want a Hood boy [x4]
I bet you ain't never seen a nigga pushin' that work
Gettin it, how he live stuntin' on the turf
[Verse 1: E-40]
She Want a Hood boy
She want a hood boy
She don't want no mark
Body art on his arm's and neck and across his heart
They throwin' up the block
I represent my part
It's a zoo I got more animals then Noah's ark
I keep the bottles cracked
I got the dro sparked
44 cocked
S65 parked
I'm a hood boy
I be ridin' wet
Insides jelly
Touchscreen deck
They say you go boy
I love yo' swag and 'staljha'
I remember fo' you rap you used to sell that yowder
Breitling for Bentley watch
26 inch socks
Pick a ride girl
I got a car lot
[Hook:]
I bet you ain't never seen 26's on a range
Iced out VVS stones and a chain
She Want a Hood boy [x4]
I bet you ain't never seen a nigga pushin' that work
Gettin it, how he live stuntin' on the turf
She Want a Hood boy [x4]
[Verse 2: E-40]
I got paper
But I be on the under
Every 3 or 4 weeks I change my phone number
Pope's be trying to watch me
On some old shit
I give em' the same line
I don't know shit
I don't want a model
I want some stretch marks
30 pound butt meat cheeks pull apart
Damn I be coonin'
Japanese jeans on
Shorty on my line
She got me on her ringtone
She love me
I like her
I'm too hood
To wife her
I'm to hood to wife her
Plus I got 3 just like her
I'm on this XO Landy
Mixed with 40 water
[Hook:]
I bet you ain't never seen 26's on a range
Iced out VVS stones and a chain
She Want a Hood boy [x4]
I bet you ain't never seen a nigga pushin' that work
Gettin it, how he live stuntin' on the turf
She Want a Hood boy [x4]
[Bridge:]
I can tell when she lookin' at me
I can tell she wan't a nigga from the streets
She wan't that hood boy [x4]
I can tell when she lookin' at me
I can tell she wan't a nigga like 40
She wan't that hood boy [x4]
[Hook:]
I bet you ain't never seen 26's on a range
