Fat fat, uh
And along came Pos
Fat fat
[Posdnuos]
It's a sure bet
When I stare into your dark browns I get
Overwhelmed, overjoyed, overstep
My bounds, on your touchy subject
Your weight, shape's not what I date
It's you, my crew don't mind it thick (Uh-uh)
Every woman ain't a video chick (Nah)
Or runway model, anorexic
I love what I can hold and grab on
So if you burn it off,keep the flab on
We gonna stay gettin our collab on (Oww)
Girl we gonna stay gettin our collab on (Ooh, ooh)
We gonna stay gettin our collab on
[Chorus: Devin the Dude]
Don't stuck on the things they say, now you know it's a nasty world
Tryna get witcha anyway 'cause I know your a nasty girl
We's never gon' discriminate so lemme compliment your size
Oooh-ooh oooh-ooh oooooohhhh..
Yeah it's nothin but a litte baby, fat fat [5x]
[Posdnuos]
Claim you outta shape, you not outta place (Uh-uh)
You keep it natural with no powdered face
Without exercise you got the eye
Starin you down, make me wonder why
You women wanna frown at them stick figures
On them little ass girls, when a clique of niggaz
Run up and try to hurl game for real
Your frame holds appeal in the everyday
World in conceal is not the way
To go, I'm tellin you I had to let
Ya know, ya need to let it all hang
[Dove]
Don't be scared to show a little of that thang-thang
No matter how you weigh it girl it's femine
Got a body everybody wanna know (Yea yea)
Be the private dancer in my Luke show (C'mon girl)
Skip the salad girl, bring us both a menu
Eat the whole box of chocolates I send you (Heh)
See girl, ya more than just apple in my eye,
Confess I wanna get up in ya thighs
Downs, the rest'll tell you all the things..
[Chorus: Devin the Dude]
[Dove]
I love it when y'all broads wear it skintight (Skintight)
Make the big panties look like little panties (Heh)
Tryin to lose that bottom girl you been right
I saw who make ya cookies I should go and thank ya granny (Uh-huh)
Don't mind you being conscious of ya calories
If gettin paper stack man you'd get salaries
You ain't in this alone I got a tummy to
Just lemme watch the weight, don't let it trouble you (C'mere girl)
Nine ten specimen up in ya jeans
You 'bout a size seven and just make it fit
Slim Fast, lypo, and body creams
I'll put you on the dogs I got a candle lit
[Chorus: Devin the Dude] 2x
Yeah, it's nothin but a little baby, fat fat [5x]
