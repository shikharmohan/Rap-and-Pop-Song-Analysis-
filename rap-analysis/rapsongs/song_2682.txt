Foxy Brown:
Yo, it's the cruel summer, cruel stool in the hummer
With the visor twist back its the #1 stunner
Back on the block with some shit that the cops had banned
I cease niggas like the Taliban
16 in. starelords in the Nautica van, with a fresh pair of filas
and the dappour Dan and gettin' fancy in the shallor from Delancy
and only real New Yorkers will understand me
Wit a good Mavado and a crisp pair of lotto
Now my niggas up in omm at the bar holdin' bottles
It's not for real, wit other niggas followin' 
Bet they try to see us, but they never gonne be us now,
The love is gone and the foolin' is done
And if they ain't about they money, bet them niggas gettin oned and,
Take big poppa back to the slums
Ain't nothin' far, show yu how to do this Hun....
Chorus:
(Cruel) cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own, it's a cruel
(It's a cruel) cruel summer
Now your gone
Foxy Brown:
Uh...oh, here comes Foxx again
And we knockin' bitches out the box again
Got the rap game all locked again
Like the Ill Nana days, I'm still not afraid
Dropped Chyna Doll, which y'all happened to love 
Then, Broken Silence put me back in the club
Then I gave it some time, now i'm the one to come up
Catch, The Fever this summer, i'm 'bout to run the summer
Every rotation, every rotation 3,000 spins we about to win
It's gonna be more hits, we'll see more stat
A little, Dior this and Dior that
They like, Foxx stay stylin' like she all that
I never worry, I styles in Behrberry now
Usually i'm on some grimmy shit, but,...
Let's take it bak to summer 96', come on...
Chorus:
(Cruel) cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own, it's a cruel
(It's a cruel) cruel summer 
Now your gone
Foxy Brown:
(They like Foxx, OK)
And now they tellin me,
Whoa lil' mama, let me holla at you
We could keep this on the low lil' mama
Now look hommie i'm out of your budget
And, supportin' Foxx is not in your budget, 
Plus, Anything I want, ain't hard to have 
Soon as I drop a joint, people startin' to BLAB
Talk about they seen me trying to park the Naaav
I don't even drive, I give them Cars to Gav, now....
(Cruel) cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own, it's a cruel
(It's a cruel) cruel summer
Now your gone....
