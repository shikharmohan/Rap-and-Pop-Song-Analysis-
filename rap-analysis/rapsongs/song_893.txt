Huh, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hah, uhh, uhh, uhh
What, some more some more
Some more, some more, niggaz didn't want no more
Now, ready for whylin' my niggaz
Let's set it like we on the Island my niggaz, I'm with it
Yo, my clique startle bitches
With a remarkable sparkle for my bitches with me
You know we stay dumb
And keep shop runnin' just the like a 24-hour deli
The way y'all niggaz be poppin' that shit you be talkin'
Y'all niggaz don't be nothin but a 24-hour celly
To talk that funny shit to someone you know
While I bag these bitches and take them to 24-hour tellys
Type of chickens to let me get in they belly
Little sexy thug bitches who want me to fuck them to Makeveli
Then get with my niggaz and smoke up a ounce
Crowd up in whatever amounts, makin' bitches skip to my bounce
So forever we be shinin' like diamond
Fresher than the fragrance of limon when we strike it's all in the timin'
Corporate niggaz bug on how we be stylin'
Fuckin' with huge contracts with wife-beaters on
On the day of the signin'
Makin' all my bitches check for this shit
My live niggaz know the truth
That's why they always got respect for this shit
Bust one for me, Bladow!!
All my niggaz holdin' they guns with me, Bladow!!
And restin' and stackin' they ones with me, Bladow!!
My peeps who hang around where I'm from with me, Bladow!!
Who run with me, Bladow!!
Bust one for me, Bladow!!
My bitches that'll fuck 'til they cum with me, Bladow!!
Whylin' they be havin' they fun with me, Bladow!!
In the struggle they be beatin' they drums with me, Bladow!!
In the slums with me, Bladow!!
Bust one for me, Bladow!!
And now we mash y'all, harass y'all
Until the shit we doin' pass y'all
You know we steadily readily give it to niggaz
And blow up the spot for niggaz before we do the dash y'all
Ain't nuttin' wrong 'til we perform
Y'all niggaz know we bout to blast y'all
Fast me and my niggaz crash the party
Hit my niggaz with shit and splash bitches before we flash y'all
Now whassup? All of my niggaz salute
When we get busy give me my loot, or lay up in a box with a suit
Shit that I tell you will all be the truth
Stay on a live nigga recruit, and take y'all niggaz back to the root
I tyin' my laces all up in my boot
All the bitches say that I'm cute, blowin' on it just like a flute
Now now now, before we blind y'all we shine and remind y'all
Shit we got be always one of a kind y'all
We constructin' a new design y'all
Better keep up my niggaz because you will get left behind y'all
Let us bust a bottle of wine now
And celebrate in the name of them niggaz that control the times now
Now watch it, as we just pick up the pace
You just might a hole in your face
My crew might take a whole of the space
Completely, obligated just to keepin' you dumbin'
And get to breakin' all the shit up in club once you know that we comin'
My bitches check for this shit
My live niggaz know the truth
That's why they always got respect for this shit
Bust one for me, Bladow!!
All my niggaz holdin' they guns with me, Bladow!!
And restin' and stackin' they ones with me, Bladow!!
My peeps who hang around where I'm from with me, Bladow!!
Who run with me, Bladow!!
Bust one for me, Bladow!!
My bitches that'll fuck 'til they come with me, Bladow!!
Whylin' they be havin' they fun with me, Bladow!!
In the struggle they be beatin' they drums with me, Bladow!!
In the slums with me, Bladow!!
Bust one for me, Bladow!!
