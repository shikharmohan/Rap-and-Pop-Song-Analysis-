Oh look out, oh huh come on
What'cha like a whole lot of
(Tyrese yeah)
What'cha like a mediola?
(What'cha like?)
What'cha like?
(Can you tell me baby?)
All night long
(All night long)
I like 'em brown, yellow
Puerto Rican or Haitian with
Good conversation plenty big faces
It's a must I stay luxurious
Jewelry cut precision like I bust
Been with it since Funkdafied blew up
It's evident shit I can't be touched
Niggas say I'm too much I trust its true
Why lie? See for yourself when I slide through
Drive by your big say
Don't look, you do
Shine so bright in wind you too
You wish boo boo could ride with you tonight
Ain't nothing in the world that Brat can't do
She attractive to them him, her, and you shit

Drop dead, the cost is priceless

    What do you like?
    A whole lot of foreplay
    Right before you get started
    What do you like?
    Me on top
    You on the bottom, tight body
    What do you like?
    Somebody that can make you say
    Wow oh wow, all night long
    All night long, tell me
[Da Brat]
What's up? The setting a hot ass club
And you still be sweating me
I don't see nothing with giving a little love
But nigga just let me breathe
Damn you cute as hell so let's switch the digits
Then I got to leave
And you can buy me a couple of drinks
But I'mma go socialize and smoke my weed
And I like it when you keep your eyes on me
And I like it when you touch my privates see
And I like it sex and ecstasy
When the belt buckle loosen up undress me
Already juiced up that come naturally
Wax on and off so romantically
No woman can slow dance or throw
