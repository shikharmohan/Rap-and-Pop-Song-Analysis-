Intro whispering: 
Let's talk about money 
Get money

I'm Poe, as Edgar Allen 
But I'm a poet when I'm freestylin

The Imperial like margerin, I'm butter 
Yes like Bel-Air 
Common Sense: 
Lookin' at my fake Gucci, it's about that time 
It's time for some perculator 
I circulate around the block 
Black to get me a six pack a half of Harrold's chicken 
A good combination, when I get bubbly I do it in moderation 
1 brew, 1 brew, I said 1 brew at a time 
Ynot: 
Well I'm a two timer of women that'll 3 times a lady 
Ms. Haiti say Sade and my Ms.Golper say 
"Yo whoop there it is" call me E cause I equal MC's squared 
In the bed marks know I got the key to get the girls 
Noses open like the vapors, more pub than the papers 
More papers than the press, oh yes I gets paid 
Common Sense: 
Yo, I didn't grow up up po po but once you get grown and out on your 
own 
Bills apon bills apon bills is what you have 
Before you get your check than you already spend half 
See I make money, money doesn't make me 
I'm a reflection of my section and section 8 
Ynot: 
Enough, I own 8 sections of the world, where I'm sexin' 8 girls 
Where I have them comin' in (ugh) 8 seconds 
I told Victoria her Secret you suck life a crest 
I Ultrawhite my secretery, I went to Tibet 
To bet on a horse you bet your life 
Mine was better and now your deader, than a (door knob) eeea wrong

sleigh dog 
I saw dogs who are under me, I over man, call me Doverman 
Cause I'm a Pincer of pennies that's pretty, then you see green from 
all money

Real friendly like an officer, friendly and a gentleman 
Friendly like neighbors, not Jim but like Homer I got attention salute

And when I walk the street I'm never looking bummy 
Common Sense:

Comm: 
Ok there was a black man a white man and a chinnese man 
The black man of coarse he was po (yeah) 
THe white man. He was rich (uh ha) 
And the chinnese man, he owned a store (alright c'mon) 
Ok the blackman lived on Beech Street 
The white man lived on Wall Street 
And the chinese man's store is where they all meet 
Not really on the good foot 
Because the white man kept steppin' on the black man's toes 
And in his shoes there were holes 
But the white man didn't care, shit he didn't have to wear it (uh ha) 
He scratched that pad he got from his parents, with his tight ass 
He would of been poor white trash, but anyway 
Everyday the blackman would ask for some spare change 
But Adam, the white man would stare strange 
So the black man got fed up 
cause wasn't nobody feedin' him and feedin' him 
And took red by his neck and started beatin' him and beatin' him 
The chinnese man got noyd and broke out like a peon 
And now the blackman own the store and the name of it is Leons 
(what's that?) 
Barbeque that is. Rib tips hotsuace, mild sauce, fries
