Scott Storch why you have to do it like this to 'em
feels like a new day
Listen
Now every time i come in i hit ya niggas, regardless, you get retarted, na na niggas aint got a clue.
On how the fuck i do what i do,or say what i say, and spit what i spit, you aint never even gotta question who.
Cause you know that i'm the only nigga that could ever inspightly turn the place into a mutha fuckin' zoo.
Than i come in i still go crazy sh sh sh shit ma ma ma makin ni ni ni niggas do exactly what i want'em to.
From my point of view instead of tryin to step up you still tryin to play catch up and keep up with the way ya nigga grew.
These niggas panican frettin get schizophrenic and let they emotions out and i dout they could ever touch my crew.
Take a second check it i reckon my records are better than whatever record you recorded that why your shit is through.
You fuckin idiot i dont think you get it im one of the greatest ever period every syllable is true.
(Hook)
Now if you aint runnin you aint handicappin your vision i think its simple or nothing that its really plain to see.
No matter how much you try no matter how much you make an effort you niggas could never ever really fuck wit me.
(Chourus)

Catch you niggas and snatch you niggas you bunch of bumblin fools who got me grumblin dudes all the way down the block.
Keep'em stumblin and jumblin over they wall jump ours throw in the towel see you niggas is on the clock.
And you wanna know the time see you tired of all your ma ma mumblin ma ma mublin na na nigga i got it locked.
Every single time you put my shit in the cd playa and turn up the volume you bang your head until you see me knock ock.
Continue to crumblin niggas and tumblin niggas you struggle while i humble a niggas wit the glock.
Than i watch you while i keep a fumblin while i got you ta tremblin for one of my niggas bust your head wit a rock.
Before i start to do another thing ima make you crown me the king wit such a butterswing nigga follow the flock.
Now watch my brother bring all my diamonds the summer bling when im climbin and from a glimpse tell you bitch to get of my yatch.
