Sometimes, sometimes you just know
You just know, that's all
I can feel it comin' in the air tonight, hold on
I've been waitin' for this moment for all my life
Hold on, hold on
The best of you all niggas remind me of myself when I was younger
When it was hunger that stopped the nigga from goin' under
And you wonder, why I pat you on your head, smile
Look in your eyes and thank the Lord for my child
Meanwhile, somethin' I gotta show you and I hope you can take it
Gonna leave you in the desert, and I hope that you make it
Gotta put you on your ass to see what it does to you
When you stand up an see that I'm just showin' love to you
Other niggas would put a slug through you, over your ends
Caps I fucked with are real, but hey those are your friends
It's just what you got comin' sometimes you don't know
What you askin' for, did you ask for more?
Should the casket door swing here, it is done
An thought you was a killer, you swore you'd never run
Nigga died with his gun still up in the holster
It is comin' in the air, yeah it's getting' closer
I can feel it comin' in the air tonight, hold on
I've been waitin' for this moment for all my life
Hold on, hold on
I see life through many shades of grays and blacks
I could take that an hit 'em with the blazin' tracks
When I make that you fake cats have violent dreams
Takes another dog to be able to hear my silent screams
The devil got a hold on me an he won't let go
I can feel the Lord pullin' but he movin' dead slow
Let them know that amidst all this confusion
Some of us may do the winnin'
But we all do the losin' it's just who does the choosin'
Easy goin' up or down what have you been provin'?
Jus' that you were fuckin' ground
Bitch seen the bullshit, but never spoke on it
And I know that deep down you really don't want it
I would've traded the chance of bein' the child with a father
Movin' talent and bein' able to survive when it's harder
My balance on the high beams of life, keep my dreams in strife
That's why I hit these motherfuckin' streets at night
Come on
I can feel it comin' in the air tonight, hold on
I've been waitin' for this moment for all my life
Hold on, hold on
There's a lotta shit that I let slide, 'cuz it's outta my hands
Lotta niggas I let ride, but it's not in my plans
An a lot of my mans is not seein' through the fog
Families by the truckload, feedin' them to the morgue
Full moon, aro, the howlin', err and growlin', shh, an prowlin'
Don't know love, can't show love
That means you gonna need more love
Than on old thug, but hold up, roll up
Talkin' out the side of your mouth is what's gonna let niggas know
Why you bad in your house, when they lie up to your spouse
Told her it was suicide
But you an I both knew the truth, for we'd never die
Listen nigga, if you scared, get a dog, but be prepared, for the mob
'Cuz you dead up in the fog, an that's your head by the log
I can smell it in the air, I can tell when it's there
This is hell an we both here, can you feel it? Tell me yeah
I can feel it comin' in the air tonight, hold on
I've been waitin' for this moment for all my life
Hold on, hold on
Arf, arf
Haha
Aro, aro
Whoo, whoo, whoo
