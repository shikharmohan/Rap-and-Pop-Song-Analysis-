Make you wanna eat bitches, but not me
Y'all niggaz eat off the plate all you want but not D
I fuck with these hoes from a distance
The instant they start to catch feelings, I start to stealin' they shit
Then I'm out just like a thief in the night, I sink my teeth in to bite
You thinkin' life, I'm thinkin more like, "Whassup tonight?"
Come on Ma, you know I got a wife
And even though that pussy tight I'm not gon' jeapordize my life
So what is it you want from a nigga?
I gave you, you gave me, bitch, I blazed you, you blazed me
Nothin' more, nothin' less, but you at my door
Willin' to confess that it's the best you ever tested
Better than all the rest, I'm like, "Aight girlfriend, hold up
I gave you, what you gave me Boo, a nut for real"

Aiyyo, I think about when a nigga didn't have
And a nigga told a joke, and the bitches didn't laugh
See now I do the math, I see if you got this
And this and this to some cats, that nigga's the shit
And that's all they fuckin' with, but see these bitches don't know
If these bitches ain't for real, these bitches don't go
Knock on door, no show, I'm sleep tryin' to creep
Wit yo' best friend, put it in, dig deep
X let me talk to 'em for a minute
Oh, I know, I know it's so hard to be a victim of my reality
Heard you callin' me names, said, I was trife
One thing you gotta know, I'ma be a nigga for life
