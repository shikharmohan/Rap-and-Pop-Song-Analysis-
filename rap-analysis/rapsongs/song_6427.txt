Snuck up behind him, had his hands in his pocket
Too my pistol out, unlocked it, pulled the hammer back and cocked it
And left his shit all on the carpet, I seen a
(Murder, murder)
I pin-pointed my target, I'm making my way up out the building
I got the nigga that I came here to get, notify his children
That they old man done fell up out the game

And killed his ass just like Jesse James
Think it's a muthafuckin' game?

What's my muthafuckin' name?
There'll be no witnesses to this homicide
No re-enactment on the late night news to be re-dramatized
All you got is a nigga with a dot
In the middle of his muthafuckin' head he been shot
Dropped in the middle of the floor and he ain't breathin'
And the niggas on the go 'cause we ain't seein'
He did his dirt and got the fuck up out the picture
The hollow point just hitcha, out of line, so it got witcha
Call the muthafuckin' helicopter
But ain't no hope 'cause the Tina broke that nigga off a hella proper
That oughta hold your monkey ass

That oughta teach your funky ass

And you done lost the fuckin' game of life
And that's a muthafuckin shame
(Fuckin' shame)
You let a nigga come around and do yo ass just like Jesse James
And that's a muthafuckin' shame
You came around this muthafucka and let me do ya like Jesse James

Wait, this muthafucka got me bent, I gots to break
Because this nigga done put his hands all up in my face

And when I get up out your ass you gon' realize it just ain'tsta be
It ain't no studio up in me
And all that bullshit I'm hearin' you talk only offends me
And lately I'm under a lot of pressure
It seems to me you can't come clean, so yo, I gots to check ya
I pull my .45 and
(Buck, buck, buck, buck)
And right before he die I
(Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck)
I could give a muthafuck about the sentence

'Cause life has no meaning, no meaning
We were all born to die, so no screaming

Put out your muthafuckin' brains
