Yeah, whassup? Whassamatta you?
(You)
Why you lookin' so sad?
(So sad)
KRS is back, but you don't look so glad
(He's back)
Ahh, shutupayouface, look at this place
Why was I chosen to pick up the race?
And carry the flame, the torch, the name?
Millennium games, it's all the same
Sinners repent, many for fear
End of the year, everyone cheers
Only a few hear my voice in they ears
Everyone else well they really don't care
But what if I told you I could read the future
And in the future, they the losers
We the winners, cause they the sinners
Well it's all mathematics, can I eat my dinner
And think why was I made to link
(Think)
Between them and the universe, battle, who the first?
I don't really care 'cause I'm really not here
I'm showin' you skill, but you still sayin', "Where?"
Whassamatta you? Why you lookin' so sad?
(You)
(So sad)
KRS is back but you don't look so glad
(He's back)
Ahh, shutupayouface
Every race, walkin' around with they head up in space
They cannot see that we all really one
In any battle I already won
Thank the creator, it's already done
KRS-One? Leavin' 'em stunned
Dunn duh-duh dunn dunn done it again
Me and Will and my brother named Ken
Now let me tell you
The bass in your face, the highs in your eyes
Will make you realize
If you down with the temple of Hip-Hop
You not no average guy, or girl
C'mon take a critical look in my world
See the metaphysical books that I twirl and twist
Forces the ventriloquist
I'm just a dummy gettin' money at this name Kris
Whassamatta you? Why you lookin' so sad
(You)
(So sad)
KRS is back, but you don't look so glad
(He's back)
Ahh shutupayouface
KRS-One, Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone
Look, I be chillin' readin' a book
While the hip-hop nation repeats my hooks
All I wanna see is y'all healthy and wealthy
Yeah, we already did it, really what can they tell me
About the pimps and the hoes, players and the clothes
You gets no money if you got no flow, no skill
C'mon y'all it's time to build
If you got no skill, how you gon' build?
Build, c'mon y'all it's time to build
If you got no skill, how you gon' build?
Whassamatta you? Why you lookin' so sad
(You)
(So sad)
KRS is back, but you don't look so glad
(He's back)
Ahh shutupayouface, negative ass
We bring the light
North Carolina, they got me
Florida, they got me
Texas, yeah, they rock me
In New York City they got me
L.A., ha hah, they got me
Canada, up North they rock me
D.C. Atlanta, they got me
Ha hah, none of y'all can't stop me
Whassamatta you? Why you lookin' so sad
(You)
(So sad)
KRS is back, but you don't look so glad
(He's back)
Ahh shutupayouface! Give it to 'em
