Ya, I don't know why you treat me so motherfuckin' bad
You ain't gonna realize what's you got till its gone, that's real
You get's no lovin', babe
Girl, you know I got you livin' plush in the cut
And every time I wanna dig you out, you tell me, "Don't rush"
Money stashin', you got me sneakin'
And we all alone in the zone, I be tweakin'
I almost got caught, my game is lethal
I had to stay at my daddy's house on the couch last weekend
It's written on my face, and I can't even hide it
So I decided, to ride it, roses are red, and Violets are blue
He get's not love, show me love, show me love
He get's not love, show me love, show me love
Show me love, he get's not love
See I done put it on the line, see this here is genuine
And as long as you with me girl, see everything is gonna be fine
See can't nobody match it, don't touch it, ya might scratch it
This love affiar, it's so original, I call it classic
See I'm attracted, an I'm infacturated
At the same time, belated and gang related, Dogg Pound on mine
But to fine time to leave all that behind
And tryin' to spend some time and give you all of mine
Ya see, I ain't hard to get along with
To do a song with a nigga like D.J. Pooh
Dedicate this whole thing, to a girl like you, boo, look here
You know I'm true, just continue to do me like you want me to do you
And I hope we don't never have to, write another chapter
Just keep it on the real wit' me
'Cause I don't really wanna, see you on the corner
Just show a nigga love ya see
You don't show me some love
You get's no lovin' babe
