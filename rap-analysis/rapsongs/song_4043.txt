[Lil Wayne]
I got so much penetration
You can see me on the east side of New Orleans with a red bitch
Fuck the world make you walk with a leg twitch
Flow retarded
I'm on some special ed shit
The magnificent twist it like a dred bitch
And I can get up in a car and drive
And if your record is a smash I can still survive
Money ain't a thing but every thing to me
Shit I gotta make em see no one sang to me
Higher than all of the angels be
No I never choke but I strangle beats
I am just a player in this game we be
So go blame the referee don't complain to me
And I used to have a cutless on stainless feet
Passing all day up in Latoya street
Back when Scarface used to sing to me
Have me feeling like a G was the thing to be
Back when I was pedaling my 10-speed bike
Who knew I be pedaling a 6-speed white
Big dog through the doors where the little dogs bite
So if you are a female dog you don't fight
Bitch ass nigga I don't aint no masters
Rich ass nigga I got all my masters
Bitch ass nigga I ain't got no masters
Rich ass nigga
As you recall you know I love to show off
But you never thought that I would take it this far
What do you know
(Flashing lights)
What do you know

[Kanye West]
Got flows till the beat run out
I told you mothafuckas before we in the house
And we standing on the couch
With my drink and my two step
My drink and my two step
3 glasses in the row you start to think I was a lil tips
Bartender pour a round I took a few sips
Stumbling falling down I ain't drunk that;s my new step
Now why would I listen to bullshit they shovel
When they taste level ain't at my waist level
I'm fly get on a plane jet lagged already
I'm tired
The dough ya'll bags is heavy
I'm fire
The flow hard as a Chevy
So I told her me likey
She said she like me
But when she see me with a CL like Py
She just wanna grab the microphone and beat box
Even in high school I was always a special kid
First pack of condoms I asked for extra big
Now I got a flow that sit me right next to BIG
And all these old rappers don't know where the exit is
But, but, but no buts nigga what nigga
You fired mothfucka Donald Trump nigga
I'm killing these niggas can't fuck nigga
Now let's drink to that
As you recall you know I love to show off
But you never thought that I would take it this far
What do you know
(Flashing lights)

[Jay-Z]
I used to give a fuck
Now I give a fuck less
What do I think of success
It sucks too much stress
I guess I blew up quick
Cause friends I grew up with
See me as a preemie
But I'm not and my nuts big
Don't know what the fuss is
My crib is ilustrous
My rep is impeccable
Not to be fucked with
Shit. This if this is what thats all about
A bunch of niggas acting like bitches with big mouths
All this stress
All I got is this big house
Couple cars I don't bring half of them shits out
All is ace of spades
I drank just to piss out
I mean I like the taste could've saved myself 6 hours
How many times can I go to Mr. Chow tows no bull
Hld up let me move a bowel
I'll shit on ya'll niggers
O.G. tell these boys (don't shit on my nigger)
I'm way too important to be talking about extortin
Asking me for a Porsche is like asking for a coffin
In broad daylight I off your on switch
Your not too bright good night
Long kiss
Bye, bye
My reply
Blah, blah
Blast burner then past burner
Tah, tah
Finish my breakfast why
I got an appetite for destruction and you're a small fry
I got watches I ain't seen in months
Apartment at the trump
Only slept in once
Nigger said hova was over
Such dummies
Even if I fell I land on a bunch of money
You ain't got nothing from me
Let that bitch breathe
As you recall you know I love to show off
But you never thought that I would take it this far
What do you know
