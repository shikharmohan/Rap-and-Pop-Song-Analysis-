When the night falls she hear the call of the street life
See the flicker of the street lights wanna know what it be like
Wanna be right ....THERE black lipstick tatoos of a peace sign
Plus the mark of the beast sign, all night please be kind
Baby girl has no.... fear. 
Tight clothing blowing cigarette smoke in slow motion
Heart filled of love potion, but its frozen
Thinks the world so insincere
Now shes dancing with strangers she don't know the name of
The city is cleaned up but she doesn't care
[Chorus]
What u want want
U want want
Come and get it get it
*repeat*
When the night falls, she hear the call of the bright lights
see the shine of the spotlight, wanna know what that like
wanna be right... THERE
White liar with her name in the headlines
Naked pictures on her website
Just to run it into headlights
Baby girl dont you be scared
Red carpets on the arm of an artist
Be a starlett on the starlist
Papparazzi target, things near don't move just so unfair
She know that its dangerous she wants to be famous
But shes not ashamed cus it aint nothing there
[Chorus]
When the day come
And they wake up far away from 
Where they came from
See the night has betrayed them
Told them it will stay young
Told them they would stay young
Now they see a sun
The nights on the run 
Right before the rise
Black mascara's runing from their eyes
But big girls don't cry
It'll be alright, it'll be tonight
They'll cut back on the light
[Chorus]
