Everyday I need my shit done in a special way, everyday
Off the top, nigga, see me and want to serve
Just thinkin' about what they need
Ain't that some nerve, now look here twenty-four hours
Seven whole days, I demand my respect, I demand my praise
Everyday that I wake, I gotta have
Everything done with no mistakes
I take it incredibly slow
Don't try to rush me, no means no
I never said a no that meant yes
Other women get taken for granted, I guess
I got a wish list that must be fulfilled
And you gets none until I get my toes sucked
And my eyebrows plucked
I need my car waxed and floor shellac
I need my back rubbed and da bubbled in the tub
That float to the bed so that we can make love
Everyday I need my shit done in a special way, everyday
(Everyday, everyday)
Everyday I need my shit done in a special way, everyday
(Everyday, everyday)
It ain't much to ask for when I come off tour
To have my truck washed or my body massaged
All the bills paid I send home all my dough
And you being my man it just ain't for show
All the lovey dovey, yeah that is sweet
But honey bunny, you gotta earn your keep
But don't sleep 'cause I need a lotta shit done
And my ma told it's work before fun
So get started, call me cold hearted
Yeah, check it out whatever is clever
And get to stepping if you know something better
If not then respect whatcha got
Meanwhile I got a new tide at the lot
Pick it up and bring it back to the spot
This is how we do it this is how we do it everyday
I need it done in a special way, baby, tell them how it goes
Everyday I need my shit done in a special way, everyday
(Everyday, everyday)
Everyday I need my shit done in a special way, everyday
(Everyday, everyday)
On the real I need an man that understands me
And realizes the reality
I'm in the MC industry which means
I want to live lovely I gotta make money
Listen so never ask me to give it less then what I got
If it's too hot, nigga then raise up out my spot
It's my trade, I made up the black ace of spade
Alone in the world but it's me ya can't fade
'It's My Life', I do it my way
You don't like my way then hit the highway
See, I'm special not because I'm MC Lyte
But because I'm a women with the gift to bear life
It's done, yes, I've rested my case
Now run, pick up my dermalogica for my face
This is how it goes down everyday
I need it done in a special way, [Incomprehensible]
Everyday I need my shit done in a special way, everyday
(Everyday, everyday)
Everyday I need my shit done in a special way, everyday
(Everyday, everyday)
Everyday
