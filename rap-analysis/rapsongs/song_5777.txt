Poof, oh no not you, fuckin' right, bitch
Uh, what? Uh poof fuck, jump, round, jump
C'mon jump, jump, jump, round, jump, jump, jump
I ain't got no more answers left, bitch I rap it all
You just ain't gonna have no more head after I snatch it off
What in the fuck is you thinkin'?
You can't do shit if you stankin'
Keep on thankin', if I said it then it's done
I give a fuck what you bringin'
'Cuz my dick still gon' be swangin'
You hear the fuckin' choppers cuttin' niggas, run nigga
Hike nigga, hut one, nigga want some?
Ain't nuttin' to fuck ya up, representin' where I come from
Fronts and brown blunts, you oughta get down some
Recognize a fuckin killa when you be around 'em
Valiums and speed but we don't do weed
Steroids and alcohol, still a fuckin' athlete
Cock strong with my jock strap on
With the time clock 'bout to run the rock home
Yo ace boom coon and a hole in the clutch
In the pocket on the field, without gettin touched
Uh oh here I come, here I go
Uh oh, jump, round, jump
What you wanna do?
What you gonna do?
Let me know girl, jump, jump
Uh oh here I come, here I go
Jump, round, jump
What you wanna do?
What you gonna do?
Let me know girl, jump, jump
You get tackled by the style I'm usin'
I got all of my adversaries cruisin' for a brusin' with contusions
Cuts and lacerations, broken bones and open soars
Ripped spleens, sprained ankles and broken nose
I'ma bust the microphones, I rip on
I step on the stage and get my grip on
That's when you get stiff armed, it's on and I'm the shit, homes
I fucked around and lost count of bitch tha' I put the dick on
My alter ego and its cool when I talk to P
They fuckin' call me the home town hero
I'm the center of attention, topic of discussion
It's understood they already know, without me sayin' nothin'
It's been like that, since these niggas down here been wearin' badges
I'm off the heezy, I'm the reason for this pimp rap
So stuck on myself, sometimes it's like I ain't got no mind
I say, "Fuck it, dawg and go for the crowd like the goal line"
Uh oh here I come, here I go
Uh oh jump, round, jump
What you wanna do?
What you gonna do?
Let me know girl, jump, jump
Uh oh here I come, here I go
Jump, round, jump
What you wanna do?
What you gonna do?
Let me know girl, jump, jump
Nigga, you just like ten yards, always the first down
Be the first motherfucker off the bus but be the last nigga to clown
Ol' sometime in ass nigga, ol' fake regular
Regular everyday common ass
No drama ass nigga
I keep these niggas sippin' on super dick and Advil
Punishin' they motherfuckin ass and keepin' it dat real
Ain't nothin' you can do to keep a nigga off the score board
It's fourth and four, fuckin' right I'm goin' for it
Uh oh here I come, here I go
Uh oh jump, round, jump
What you wanna do?
What you gonna do?
Let me know girl, jump, jump
Uh oh here I come, here I go
