Wha wha, wha wha, wha wha, wha wha, what?
Straight off the black gold, nuts in my hand, trustin' no man
Got my glock cocked, runnin' this thing, ya understand?
We be steamin', blazin' nines, pumps and K's and
Holly Grove 17th, tha hood where I was raised in
(What, what, what?)
Niggaz bustin' heads and runnin', duckin' Feds and
Rocks under they tongues and ki's under they beds and
Hood fulla real niggaz, twenty-four seven hustlers
Ehh, until we shove a barrel down ya pipe suckers
Ain't no love for no busta, no fear for no coward
No respect from no stunt and no money without power
We keepin' niggaz hotter, eww, nasty and sour
Pile up in the Eddie Bauer and Blaka at every hour
Some niggaz like that powder, foldin' up what they drain
Some like that weed or that dope and some shoot it up in they veins
(Oh)
From the home of that 'caine, jackin' and crackin' brains
Broadcastin' live from Tha Block, it's Lil' Wayne
(Who it is?)
Nigga you got that llello?
Well, cook something nigga
Nigga, you let them K's go?
Well, bust somethin', nigga
Are you duckin' that law?
You better run from 'em, nigga
Are you playin' with that raw?
Well, won't you front somethin', nigga?
Tha block is hot, tha block is hot ha, ha ha
Tha block is hot, tha block is hot ha, ha ha
Tha block is hot, tha block is hot ha, ha ha
Tha block is hot, tha block is hot ha
See, where I'm from we keep our guns out
Dodgin' cops and burnin' blocks so we be thugged out
It's time to floss, bring the big bodies on dubs out
And they got quarters, halfs and birds in that one house
(I got it)
(I got it)
It's all good in the hood but a lot illegal
Soon as you get it, hot skirt, there go them people
Break up the block and hit the cut by the corner sto'
End up in Miss Taylor backyard, be quiet, she on the porch
This everyday, at the spot where niggaz murder off top, boy
It's the spot where they got Fire Girls and Hot, Boys
We don't know what be goin' 'cause we so blunted from trees
And we'll be round ya all day til we '400 Degreez'
And you see where niggaz go, nobody be on the pulpit
They got a nigga got on a scarf, he flippin' out off that raw
Betta stay in yo' car, and make sure, your door is locked
(Beep, beep)
'Cause this ain't nuttin' proper 'cause tha block, is just hot
Nigga you got that llello?
Well, cook something nigga
Nigga, you let them K's go?
Well, bust somethin', nigga
Are you duckin' that law?
You better run from 'em, nigga
Are you playin' with that raw?
Well, won't you front somethin', nigga?
Tha block is hot, tha block is hot ha, ha ha
Tha block is hot, tha block is hot ha, ha ha
Tha block is hot, tha block is hot ha, ha ha
Tha block is hot, tha block is hot ha
See, watch your step on my set, gotta walk like, talk like
We done shot out all the street lights
So you can't see who we be like
And we like to dress in all black up in my residence
Ain't got on no suits 'cause we ain't tryin' to be Presidents
And ever since the coke drought, niggaz been on a trip y'all
So you better watch what y'all playin wit
'Cause a nigga will try to flip y'all
They hit y'all, jam you up and put a gun to your jug
Hah, catch your breath, now shh, catch a slug
It's street smarts, plenty niggaz that keep spots
When the heat starts, ain't nobody got sweethearts
Callin' weak shots, you could come try to cheap talk
We cut your week short, them lil' boys don't give a damn
Go all out for that cake, won't hesitate to kill a man
Run in his house and kidnap the nigga, him and his fam
Tie 'em up, put 'em in the vans then put a gat in his jaws
Tch, one move blow his cactuses off
Nigga you got that llello?
Well, cook something nigga
Nigga, you let them K's go?
Well, bust somethin', nigga
Are you duckin' that law?
You better run from 'em, nigga
Are you playin' with that raw?
Well, won't you front somethin', nigga?
