Somebody call the cops, let 'em know the funk bandit's back
With more bounce to the ounce, it's the brat tat tat tat
The funk-keeper Competition's sweet but known for makin'
Speakers bleed smokin haloweed, givin' you what 'cha need
Indeed I'm nice, jewelery full of ice
The industry ain't been the same since I came to sprinkle my spice
Tonight's the night and we gonna all get lifted, recognize the gifted
And how there's no fuckin' around in the west-side district
Get it twisted, if you wanna choose your destiny
Leave all that simple shit at home and bring your fuckin' best to me
'Cause right here playtime stops, okay, rhymes flop and all that
Real-deal shit hits tops, see I'm the cream of the crop
Head bitch in charge and there ain't nothin' or nobody
That I've barred thus far, repertoire full of wicked shit
Lay back kick a shit, all the right shit to give a nigga a hit
If you let's nothin' hold you back and your limit is the sky
Put your hands in the air, let's all get high
Roll up a fat one and pass it around
Lay back hypnotized to the funky sound
If you let's nothin' hold you back and your limit is the sky
Put your hands in the air, let's all get high
Roll up a fat one and pass it around
Lay back with the brat, just get on down
  (Now, roll up a sac so that we can smoke it together)
Now, how high can you go 'cause you know we can choke
Take it slow, we smokin' junk 'cause you rollin' wit Moe
We havin' a celebration, we doin' this all night
If you wanna get away, you can play 'em other times
And don't forget my niggas be doin' this shit the thuggish way
We have you thuggin' where the thug lately? We Krayzie
And niggas don't drop we got the bud blaze-ay
So if you get out, better get with this crowd
I bet you wanna get weeded, fuck wit your thugs out of Cleveland
Stay peyoted and tweeded them thugs we blazin' we fiendin'
Now, can you feel this connect with So So Def Mo Thugs
My squad and yo posse my nigga we goin' be alright
So come around everybody, party down get down
And let that real shit hit yo' chest 'cause I know when I get that hydro
Your nigga thugsta come and give me some love
But somebody bang and slang yo' dog with couple of thugs from the cut
You wanna fly, you wanna fly, we go whatever
We could all get high, get high
The shit we keep to get you hypnotized
Ain't nobody dealin' with me
My nigga J can get his smoke on man
'Cause if we go broke, you won't feel bad
Yeah, but there's enough hundreds for that
To never happen in action, certified platinum slashin' bastards
Draw shit faster than Eastwoods, I wish you could be like me
I broke the Mo with fatality, visual shit that you can see
These synthetic niggas usually smoke reefers with my peeps
Get deeper than any bitch, watch me and yo' nigga creep
Sky's the limits, damn them lights 'cause Krayzie got the Hydro
Inject a deadly venom grinnin' and watch them all die slow
We non-fictional characters carry grudges till it's dealt with
Underestimate the wrong bitch and get yo' shit spend
You better light a splife and mind yo' motherfuckin' business
Or get that ass put in the witness protection program
Till I'm finished, diminished, your entourage is my level
Blindin' with the VVS rocks possessin' like the devil
Pushin' custom drop-tops, keep Segante' in the glove box
Puffin' with crooked cops and can't nuthin' hold me back
'Cause nigga my shit don't stop
You wanna fly, you wanna fly, you wanna fly
I think you wanna fly, you wanna fly, you wanna fly
We can all get high, get high, get high
All get high, get high, get high
You wanna fly, you wanna fly, you wanna fly
I think you wanna fly, you wanna fly, you wanna fly
We can all get high, get high, get high
And all get high, get high, get high
You wanna fly, you wanna fly, you wanna fly
I think you wanna fly, you wanna fly, you wanna fly
We can all get high, get high, get high
All get high, get high, get high
You wanna fly, you wanna fly, you wanna fly
I think you wanna fly, you wanna fly, you wanna fly
We can all get high, get high, get high
And all get high, get high, get high
You wanna fly, you wanna fly, you wanna fly
I think you wanna fly, you wanna fly, you wanna fly
