Comin' down in candy car, smokin' on some candy bar
Everyday I'm choppin' blades, comin' through on old school maids
Got in this game so heavily, just like Frankie Beverly
Silly nigga that Southern girl put cocaine up in your world
'Cause I'm a young ass nigga on the slab
Comin' through in a whippin' Nav'
I used to be out on the ave
But now all my keys got the Midas stamp
Change my name to Sweet Charles
Smell like sixty-four dollar cologne
Comin' down in burgundy Brougham
And I keep a chip off in my phone
Sweet Charles, bitch!  Hold up smoke somethin'
C'mon c'mon
