Break break down, steady breakin' me on down
Break break down, steady breakin' me on down
Break break down, steady breakin' me on down
Break break down, steady breakin' me on down
You called yesterday to basically say
That you care for me but that you're just not in love
Immediately I pretended to be feeling similarly
And led you to believe I was okay to just walk away from the
One thing that's unyielding and sacred to me
Well I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath the guise of smile gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal the fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights and then I breakdown and cry
So what do you do when somebody you're so devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you and it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through
Do you cling to your pride and sing "I will survive"?
Do you lash out and say how dare you leave this way?
Do you hold in vain as they just slip away?
Well I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath the guise of smile gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal the fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights and then I breakdown and cry
Break break down, steady breakin' me on down
Break break down, steady breakin' me on down
It'll break ya down, only if you let it
Everday crazy situation's rockin' my mind
Tryin' to break me down but I won't let it, forget it
I been feelin' like you breakin' me down
Kickin' me 'round, stressin' me out
I think I better go and get out and let me relieve some stress
Don't ever wanna feel no pain, hopin' for the sun but it looks like rain
Lord, I just will not maintain, yeah, often feel the pressures ya' all
But never the less crazy won't fall, it's over, it's endin' here
Well I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath the guise of smile gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal the fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights and then I breakdown and cry
Well I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
