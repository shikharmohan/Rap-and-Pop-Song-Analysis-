Still smokin' bud, still smokin' weed
King Edward, Philly Blunt, Swisha, keep groovin'
Tampa Sweet, good ol' Optimo
Easy water, joker
My lips get black and my fingertips burn
And my eyes half way open
Cough cough and I'm chokin'
But bitch, I'm still smokin'
I wanna be puffin' this like I ain't be worryin' 'bout nothin'
If you gonna get the cigar, nigga I'll do the stuffin'
I roll 'em swoll like broken arms
But I sure hate when they come around
This bitch I don't know talkin' 'bout
What chall smokin' on
'Cause niggas like that, we call 'em Hoovers
They try to get cool with ya
To smoke your weed up is what they do ya
Puff, puff, puff, puff, goddammit
Nigga, you ain't chip in no shit here
Bitch, what's happenin'
But if you did, then it's good and it goin' down
Get rid of them nickels and them dimes
Bitch, we throwin' pounds
Tenth through 11th to the 12th ward bound
But P said one of my niggas
I heard somebody say one time
But I paid it no mind and I kept rollin'
But that was the Po Pos
I gotta get rid of this fat ass Optimo that I'm holdin'
Excellerate and I made that left on line center
I hit that bitch one more time, then threw it out the window
Young niggas in a big white truck
You know what's up, they're lookin' to catch you fuckin' up
It just so happened that I was hot
They looked in the back on the floor
And the silver canon and they found the pot
I can't believe that I got popped
It took me 2 hours and 1500 dollars to get unlocked
Straight from jail to the weed spot
Shit I took that as a minor setback
Hell no, I ain't stop
And I'm still smokin' bud
Still smokin' weed
