Relax & take notes,
While I'm put you up on game
Get a sweeter connect, then if I put you up on cane,
But you should grab yourself a seat and a Whisky Double,
Because the girls of the world ain't nothin but trouble,
They like a little danger and might not admit it,
But they on for the chase and they want us to come and get it,
PLUS THEY LOVE A YOUNG THUG THATS OVERFLOWIN WITH SWAG!
AND KEEPS HIS WOMEN ALL DRAPED IN NEW LOUIS VUITTON BAGS!
With Louis Vuitton pumps, look at her walk to 'em,
I like open toe straps, but SG talk to em!
[Sean Garrett:]

[Ludacris:]
Yea, we gonna take this to verse 2,
Now some of em wanna family, a sense of security,
Neckless, bracelets and all other types of jewelery,
So, shop till you drop, or till it makes you psychotic,
Heres a triple Black Card, it ain't trickin IF YOU GOT IT!
Others will stay content if you just makin 'em laugh,
Send 'em to the spa, get a massage then bubble bath,
So later on, they can dance and throw a drink in they hand,
And try any and everything they never did with they man, ME!
So get loose and slide off your damn garments,
Show 'em whose the boss, they take orders from the SERGEANT
There's places on your body that I'm tryin to find,
So in the sack, talk to me, tell me what's on your mind,
And I got plenty more to learn if you'z invested in me,
They don't love me for who I am but who I'm destined to BE,
And for that!, I'll give you everything up under the sun,
Cause in the end, ALL THE GIRLS JUST WANNA HAVE FUN!
