{"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides
By the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men
Blessed is he, who in the name of charity and goodwill
Shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness
For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children
And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance
And furious anger those who attempt to poison
And destroy my brothers
And you will know my name is the Lord
When I lay my vengeance upon thee"}
Smokin' MC's like a bowl of Buddha, burnin' in my bong now
You don't want to step to the rhythm of the funk degrees
You'll be a prisoner in the temple of thieves
Move it out just move it on out, no doubt
We the number one crew
Kickin' more gas niggas out the house
Puttin' up an argument, just don't bother
'Cause I'll whoop that ass just like I'm your father
Take heed to the master's call yes y'all
(Bring your cell phone 'cause I fade them all)
Bullets fly but they don't give a fuck about who dies
When you're in the middle of the fuckin'
No question, confrontation, nowhere to run from the assassination
Let the rain come down, whoops there goes another body on the ground
Watch out for G hound, it's the undisputed Cypress family
Kickin' up dust can you handle us fragilely
Growin' inside your mind like a tumor
Spreading in your head like a rumor
Venomous, I'm from the underground
I take care of business, what the fuck is this?
Move 'em out, move 'em out now
(Move 'em out)
Move 'em out, move 'em out now
(Move 'em out)
Move 'em out, move 'em out now
(Move 'em out)
Move 'em out, move 'em out now
(Move 'em out)
Suckas come in all shapes sizes and colors
Let me get the rope and hang 'em 'till their fuckin' necks broke
Wind passage cut off, now you can't breathe
Let me give you what you need, a fat dose of the good weed
Like a puppet on a string, I'm the one controlling your ass
With the rough shit here to bring
My army grows like the Buddha I sold ya
Every seed planted is another fuckin' soldier
Like the 'coup d'etat', now ya are in the middle of the ambush
Stuck in your car they can't find ya
At the bottom of the lake let me remind ya
You better be lookin' behind ya
It's too late, ain't no one standin' here
Hallucination, bees hummin' in your ear
Paranoia, dwelling to your dome piece
Increase, the level of the terror that move ceased
Move 'em out, move 'em out now
(Move 'em out)
Move 'em out, move 'em out now
(Move 'em out)
Move 'em out, move 'em out now
(Move 'em out)
Move 'em out, move 'em out now
(Move 'em out)
Make a move, make a move, every posse make a move
Make a move, make a move, every posse make a move
Make a move, make a move, every posse make a move
Make a move, make a move, every posse make a move
Come on
Open up the doors for the high funk Buddha
With the light point the dick can die
Rolling with the six shooter
Thirty-eight, still shootin' real straight
Lookin' for the buster that I must eliminate
No surprise as the inches demise
Let the four flow as I look him right in the eyes
And rip these niggas in half
With the fabergraph
They can't find a path
I like the aftermath
Still I reign the sect we remain
The big bad Cypress Hill, fuckin' niggas up again
When I aim I'm scopin' for your brain
Brother stay low, cross hairs break you up the frame
Move 'em out now
(Move 'em out)
Move 'em out, move 'em out now
(Move 'em out)
Move 'em out, move 'em out now
(Move 'em out)
Move 'em out, move 'em out now
(Move 'em out)
Move 'em out, move 'em out now
(Move 'em out)
Move 'em out, move 'em out now
(Move 'em out)
Move 'em out, move 'em out now
(Move 'em out)
Move 'em out, move 'em out now
(Move 'em out)
{Ah, now that the mind is open so one can clearly see
What they don't want you to see
But it's obvious, isn't it my brother?
Get the smoke from in the front of your eyes
Got to realize, anybody don't like it, move 'em out now}
