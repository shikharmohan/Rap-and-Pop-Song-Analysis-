Yeah, c'mon
Yeah, yo
It's all about the mur*** and the killi**
Bit**** they catch feelings, nigg** mixin'
Business with pleasure won't measure, will it?
Summer's my home skillet, just came home from penet'
I tried to look out for him, now, I can't f*** with him
He had distorted vision, thought I ain't deserve this
How he the streets and I ain't put no work in
Nigg*, I ain't lock you and take all your years
You the nigg* that was careless, get the f*** out of here
Yeah, blood, sweat and tears, every buck I made
I ain't complain when you was hustlin' and I leave paid
Yeah, I'm up, boilin' blood to see me bust
Even worse they ask for help like I'm the Red Cross
I don't knock nigg** when they down, I try to lift 'em
But they tried to get all in my shoes, like they could fit 'em
Can't happen overnight, when it comes to winnin'
It's a ten year road but nigg** ain't tryin' to hear it
Orders that we makin', they be takin' too easy
Nigg** can't get any money 'cause they palms so greasy
Don't know how they survivin' though, they wish they could be
Nigg**, better watch they mouth or stop speaking so freely
Orders that we makin', they be takin' too easy
Nigg** can't get any money 'cause they palms so greasy
Don't know how they survivin' though, they wish they could be
Nigg**, better watch they mouth or stop speaking so freely
You listenin' to the world's most Infamous
This is different than what you used to
Them other nigg**, they ain't killi** it
We come through militant, nigg** be grillin' it
Screwin' up they face but my adrenaline
Is at a maximum, I can't be touched
Just as soon nigg** move, nigg** get tore up
We so confidant in ourselves, it's not fair
While you still tryin' to overcome your childhood fears
We settin' up shop, takin' over the blocks
In e'ry hood, e'ry boy, and e'ry girl gon' cop
Now, we chillin' in, new airplanes and Rolls Royces
My watch is my president and guess who's the first lady?
Yeah, my big fat princess cut
She a little overweight but I love her so much
So charged up right now, you nigg** better stop
If I squeeze, we gon' breeze to the top of the charts
Orders that we makin', they be takin' too easy
Nigg** can't get any money 'cause they palms so greasy
Don't know how they survivin' though, they wish they could be
Nigg**, better watch they mouth or stop speaking so freely
Orders that we makin', they be takin' too easy
Nigg** can't get any money 'cause they palms so greasy
Don't know how they survivin' though, they wish they could be
Nigg**, better watch they mouth or stop speaking so freely
