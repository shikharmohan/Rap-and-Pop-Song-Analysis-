Cheese, put some cheese
A fat can of pinto beans
Between your knees
Cabbage and greens and rice
That's why cats chase mice
Shrimp-fried rice falafel
Roscoe's chicken and waffles
The condoms were invalid
Butter beans with egg salad
They was quick to exchange the head
But now instead, they rub each other down
[Humpty-Hump]

But I said, yo, take it slow cause he knows the flow
[Shock G]
She used to be quick to lick, the trick
But now she just wanna rub em down

PeeWee came fat with the D-flo

She told him to strap his 'zack with the hat
Cause she didn't want to catch his fleas

But it was all a bit in the wrong Christmas tree
So let's all light up a pack of butter beans!

Rub me down, tonight
Just rub me down, tonight (x2)
