I gotta taste for you, now wat you wanna do?
Girl, you cold, let me suck out your flu
Girl, you cold, girl, you cool
You heard of salt n peppa, well girl, you food
Girl, you hot like a bowl of hot stew
And I just stood over ma stew and just blew
And when there's no more of you in da soup
I remove ma spoon and drink your juice
If you want to do me, do what cha wanna do
If my job is to blow, you can bet she blue
Mic check 1, 2, how a bout 1, 2
P-L-A-Y because I don't have a clue
But when I find out, I'm a show and tell you
When I lift my top lip, I could still smell you
When I swallow ma spit, I could still taste you
Put dat pussy in ma face every time I face you
It goes P-U-S-S-Y
Because it's da reason I am alive
Momma, I need it to stay alive
It's like I gotta eat it just to survive, because
I'm da pussy monster, da pussy monster
Da pussy monster, da pussy monster
Girl, you gotta feed me, pussy, pussy
Pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy
Now let me get back to her
She call me Dracula, and I'll vacuum her
Catfish, dat fish, dat cat, tuna

Dat lil' puss there runnin' so I'll tackle ya
Baby, can I be the worm in ya apple butt?
Now go back in her, and if you backin' up
I'll suck the front of dat pussy from da back of ya
Now I'm a throw it on her like a black Acura
