That splash against my hollow bones
That splash against my hollow bones
High potency top, smoke a bag of black
And feel the vibe, wanna be wise
We, form on a risin' corner mean five
Laws in disguise, throw on your slides
Young niggas racist, smokers is basic
We seen the eyes, layin' up playin' the cut
What, stay in the truck, somethin' told me duck
Foldin' me up, my shoulders struck
Out of luck, fuck the potters up
Fell on a daze like a Golotta snuff
  (That splash against my hollow bones)
Niggas tried to body me up
I'm in the lobby bleedin'
  (That splash against my hollow bones)
Niggas in the witness office probably eatin'
And sprintin' and beefin', when they heard the shots
Called the precinct and seen barber nieces beastin'
Niggas shot Shalar features and shocked her was a Elisis
Bent the spinal cordless creatures
I'm gaggin' and flaggin' a cab down
Guess who in the Benz wagon, draggin' my sound down
Mackin' it was Dale Breedy the greedy
Connivin' ass snake genie
Cop with a bikini will murder charge and benini
I'm feelin' wheezy and the drain from the cheeba
  (That splash against my hollow bones)
Grievin' ain't even lookin' decent
Seein' police niggas reachin'
That splash against my hollow bones
That rocks my
Fleein' the crime scene speedin'
Beefin' leavin' behind cream
Not even peepin' that I was leakin'
Won't see the precinct just got a recent case beaten
Still Jakes are creepin'
Don't blow ya spot, stay the weekend
Keep the Ruger peelin' who's squealin'
Few knew the dealing's
Keep the steel concealed in
'Cause we got no time for feelings
Eyes on the buildin' guards are on the corners illin'
Million dollar block villain plottin' on a killin'
Feel like, a superhero talkin' like a true DeNiro
They boost his ego path and broke down
Reduced to zero
Cops feel we poors hopin' I'll reveal my source, source
That splash against my hollow bones
That rocks my soul, oh oh, oh oh
Outside the check cashin', flashin'
Dipped in fashion
Five cherry-faced faggots tried to cash in
They keep laughin', Ghost you get ya face bashed in
  (That splash against my hollow bones)
Who gave you these privileges son? Why you maxin'?
And we
  (That splash against my hollow bones)
Feignin' to take those move slow
I'm hearin' how you broke Rob's nose
And I heard you keep a bangin' hammer
Golden brass diamonds embroideries
That was stolen that you haven't reported G
Make very little noise, my shit hiccup
Don't make this big stick up bigger
Me and the boys I thought for a second then chose
Rather than froze
Had the Jim star on my hand
Yo what the fuck yo, that's when I ripped Timothy
Snatch and dip John like imbaggable
Had the mini axe tool, faxed him
  (That splash against my hollow bones)
Shots rang off, bin, boggle-de-dum
That splash against my hollow bones
