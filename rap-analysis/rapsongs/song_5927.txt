Aiyyo, check this one out
Somethin smooth
Calm you down
Check out the story
Ya know what I mean?  1998
It's vinia on the hook up
Pete rock
Aiyyo, a type love story, with the guts and glory
Yes a high priced shorty, dollar signs when you saw me
Havin naughty intentions witcha
Rear suspension, a star, the first convention
Got the camera's attention, I mentioned no names
I guess times changed from the subway trains
To the first class planes, still the same type of freak
In the penthouse suite, and rendezvous to meet
I guess we goin deep cover you still got the hunger
For the chocolate boy wonder, back to the days of thunder
Thighs and light eyes, caramel surprise
Soft skin and healthy size, I'm just that type of guy
Fly and cool, ms. jamaica at the pool
Takin her to school, debate the golden rule
Only fools fall fast, sellin out for the cash
But this love's gotta last from the ash to the dust
Build trust, beyond the lust, kick back
And split a dutch, chill out and tell tales and such
You're mind blowin
Chorus: vinia mojica
Mind blowin, decision
Causes head-on collision
You know it
And I know it
That you need me, I want you
[pete rock]
Yo, a ghetto superstar, got a taste for caviar
So far, you're up to par, with the luxury car
The lex or the benz, connect with your friends
Once again in the lens tryin to follow the trends
From tens to hundreds, designer tight threads
And strong black dreads, catch the "ooh" from the heads
("you see that dime kid? ")
Yo a med school grade, my pen still on the pad
Remembering, what we had, fubu past the fad of lugz and thugs
Now we sip each other's wine on persian rugs
Givin love and backrubs
In tubs with the bubbles, carefree from the struggle
I like your new muscle, so appealing to my hustle, to knock
It's the one and only pete rock
Got a lock on this lady might even make a baby
No time to act shady, it's strictly for the ladies
Mind blowin
Chorus
[pete rock]
Aiyyo, playin trivial pursuit, with lottery loot
Feedin me grapes and fruit in your birthday suit
Parachute over paris, you way above average
Type built for marriage, with twins in the carriage
Thank aladdin for the wish and deep fry fish
There's no way we can miss (swish!) it's all good
When we back in the hood, twistin trees with no wood
When I was stressed out, you always understood
To my legend, no question, you're the answer
With the legs of a dancer, can't refuse a jolly rancher
Born a cancer zodiac, with features that attract
Causin cardiac arrest, no stress, take my hands
And caress your chest, sleep and dream about the rest
When it comes to beauty girl it's no contest
Grab ahold of yourself, and, open your eyes
Get wise to my exercise and realize
We got one life to live baby, just one
We only got one life to breeze, see us live through our seeds
Chorus (repeat to fade)
