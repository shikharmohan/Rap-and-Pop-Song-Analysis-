Black Thought: 
It's a frantic situation(x7) 
Common: 
Extra salty 'cause whoever beat me got me for this 31 inch 
And this Alpha Bailey jacket I had just bought me 
Out of snappin my God tried to talk me 
But what could get me half way calm was this Donny Hathaway song 
The tape that it was on I had wanted while I was gone 
But forgot to pack it in fact it was in that jacket 
This demo, it's time to track it and lay it down 
Either it's somebody I know or somebody I stay around 
Day before I broke out, niggaz was over my crib gettin smoked out 
No tellin who had the place scoped out 
Donnie brought over some niggaz I didn't know 
I'm askin, who are you, they said I'm with the Mo 
If it was them, soon I will collide with them 
And they better not be rockin no new Iversons 
Then it could have been this hype that usually shovel my snow 
If I'm out of town or not, by my car, he would know 
Now, it might have been this stripper I met at Pinkhouse party 
Thick, but my furniture wasn't worth her body 
What if it was this nigga I let sleep in my crib 
To have the set of keys but that I wasn't tryin to believe 
But I could have put it past him or those other bastards 
It would be assed backwards for me to ask if they did it 
'cause whoever did ain't gon admit it 
The blunted dirty dishes is my only exhibit 
Wondering if I should give it a rest and through the wind 
It might surface 
'cause tellin Allah, Joe is worthless(uh) 
chorus(x2): Black Thought 
Hey sucka nigga, whoever you are(x3) 
Wherever you are, whoever you are
