What's happening? I keep my dreadlocks in a napkin ring
Rap and sing Unlike the homogeneous clones
I'm into earth tones, birth stones and erogenous zones
The more ticklish the more you have
Sitting on the curb of what used to be the burbs
And before that was Canarcie, I'm a disturbed and bitter herb
Like saltwater and parsley, mics crawl up, tights fall down
That's my mnemonic voice stalactite slash stalagmite
You may have this Maglite, it survived the apocalypse
And for the fragile force of an agile horse
Here's a handful of very special chocolate chips
