Gotta man that I think I'm gon love forever (ugggg)
And forever we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes I'll be thinkin of him
I'm gonna love him I'm gonna love him
Verse 1) Yo yo Sexy lookin like love no doubt
Sophisticated thug keep me guessin
Said it would be a blessin just to watch you undressin
Callin you daddy late nights I'm layin on your chest
And, stay reminiscin bout the rest
And, how they less than, tryin to come between what we share
Can't compare, could've been left, but when It's mine
I never share, fight to the death
If need be to prove that, wounds from your war
Other chicks couldn't soothe that, broke from a bad back
I'm holdin you down, throwin dirt with other pigeons
But them other fishes drown, locked in, however long
I'm playin it smart, court dates in other cities
There I'm doin my part, Wife-y, In your life see
Forever be us, passin the side of a Bentley
Or the number 2 bus, tell the whole world, papi
Eve don't want nobody else, with other dogs pick and choose
But you, I'm keepin for myself
Gotta man that I think I'm gon love forever (ugggg)
And forever we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes I'll be thinkin of him
I'm gonna love him I'm gonna love him
Gotta man that I think I'm gon love forever (ugggg)
And forever we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes I'll be thinkin of him
I'm gonna love him I'm gonna love him
(Verse 2) All my peoples thinkin I'm delirious
But the love I feel is serious, couples of the world
No comparin us, been through fist fights with cats
When I see an ?, I'm the getaway driver, so my baby can excape
Pull my ice for the bail, spendin nights in jail
Drawin hearts on the wall wit our names around the cell
It made a little craziness, maybe I'm blind
But for me to leave now, lookin for love could take a lifetime
So I'm keepin mine, Uh-huh, keep me blind
It's like heaven when we makin love, controllin my spine
Ya di da, I don't need that as long as you wit me
And you chickens thinkin that you competition, come and get me
My position is held, some try and all fail
Kitty cat, so whatever baby good enough to sell
Never leave his baby girl, mad cause he claim me
Only thug in the hood, that was wild enough to tame me
Gotta man that I think I'm gon love forever (ugggg)
And forever we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes I'll be thinkin of him
I'm gonna love him I'm gonna love him
Gotta man that I think I'm gon love forever (ugggg)
And forever we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes I'll be thinkin of him
I'm gonna love him I'm gonna love him
(Verse 3) I'm the one he'll never leave, helped him build his luxuries
Carry stories that can hurt him, still, he only trustin me
Secrets never left my mouth, even if they torture me
Always taught to hold the ground, thats thy I'll always be his queen
It's some dumb things, see him in the party, start to flip
Curses him out on the regular, just to make him sick
Disappear for a day or two to test his loyal ground
Keep my dogs on a short leash, controllin the growl, Open wide
I don't care who knows, I'm swallowin my pride
And he's fast, to blast, a cat, that he think he on the prowl
But I'll never let him go, temper flare, let it go
Always be his extra back bone, quick to let you cats know
Always by his side, Eve, the apple of his eye
Us together ain't no stoppin, snatchin pieces of the pie
Us together in our own world, whats his becomes mine
Exceed eternity with him, we'll stand the test of time
Gotta man that I think I'm gon love forever (ugggg)
And forever we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes I'll be thinkin of him
I'm gonna love him I'm gonna love him
Gotta man that I think I'm gon love forever (ugggg)
And forever we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes I'll be thinkin of him
I'm gonna love him I'm gonna love him
Gotta man that I think I'm gon love forever (ugggg)
And forever we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes I'll be thinkin of him
I'm gonna love him I'm gonna love him
