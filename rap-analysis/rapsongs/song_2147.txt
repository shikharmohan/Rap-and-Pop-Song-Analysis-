Freak nasty super bad, earring in her tongue
Smell good, Prada bag, angel perfume cologne
I'm tryin' to have me that lipstick by Mac
Make like a car accident, hit her from the back
My fetti might be salty but my game ain't damp
See I be hood [unverified]
But the only cheese I ever had was from the goods
And man that was divided among [unverified] brothers and sisters
Raised without a dad
Basically we was supposed to be have to make good
But what we hadn't [unverified] get the gat from one of my [unverified]
On the tough, Uncle Bruce [unverified]
Hustle in my veins and lungs, sucker pump
Chicken heads squash through my hood with good intentions
But always end up sparkin' antennas on bus benches
Watchu know, whatchu say, what's the sco'?
Is it a go? Then you with me after the show
You smell? We hit the hotel, and knock boots
Taught me some thangs, like who? Like Dr. Ruth
Hey, hoe
(Hey, hoe)
All up in the kitchen on the flo', feel the mantra
Do what you do good
'Cuz you know what you know good
Do what you do good
'Cuz you know what you know good
(Do what you know good)
Do what you do good
'Cuz you know what you know good
Do what you do good
'Cuz you know what you know good
(Do what you know good)
Uhh, rappers sport my style like they sport clothes
Then have the nerve to say they made it up, now that's some hoes
That ain't no stickin' to the rules and regulation ship
That ain't no man if he can't admit he grew up on The Click
On the east they got hot dogs and pretzel stands
On the west they got tacos and burrito vans
In the south, it's [unverified] and biscuit
What about the Midwest? The Midwest, dey just love to kick it
Top shelf, ghetto tycoon the area sponsor
Can't be seen like Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster
Dialin' for dollars paper route and money counters
Scrilla scratchin', paper chasin', poppin' collars
Do what you do good
'Cuz you know what you know good
Do what you do good
'Cuz you know what you know good
(Do what you know good)
Do what you do good
'Cuz you know what you know good
Do what you do good
'Cuz you know what you know good
(Do what you know good)
Do what I know good
I kick it in the hood real good
Smoke real fat big blunts
Sticky-ickies to the lil' krunks
Thirty-one double-eight-seven, that's nine-eleven
Act like you're livin'
I ain't no captain at the bar, signin' autographs on napkins
Ball 'til we have it all, bartender talkin' about
"Last call for alcohol" I'm 'bout to get to mashin' on that [unverified]
If we don't get no mo' [unverified] throw glasses at that Moesha fag
And I'm walkin' up out the do', step stuck and stutterin'
Didn't even screw up and hit the floor
If I woulda fell, it woulda been embarrassing
Full of that there liquor, walked into a closet
But I'm a king size nigga, baby, pull my coattail and just
Do what you do good
'Cuz you know what you know good
Do what you do good
'Cuz you know what you know good
(Do what you know good)
Do what you do good
'Cuz you know what you know good
Do what you do good
'Cuz you know what you know good
(Do what you know good)
