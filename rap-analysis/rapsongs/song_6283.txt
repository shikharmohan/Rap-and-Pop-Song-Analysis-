I'm your honey dipper so you say  you know
Then you react and attack every flirt and ho
But oh  no   you gots to go now  bro
To and fro  unh unh  no more
So just walk out the door and be out like Margetta
I've been through this before  but now I think I better
Kick ya to the curb 'cause this hurts  word
You dis and wanna kiss? Now that's absurd
Yo  Spinderella ain't the kind type to be pulled down, ya know
Before I go out I go blow-for-blow
So tell those hos that sittin' there waitin' by the phone
That they can have you 'cause you's gone
CHORUS
All you gotta do is just step-step
Me and you, we're through so just step-step
All you gotta do is just step-step
I hate to be ya
I'm not the one to be gone
You better go out and get someone else, hon
Who can eat your lies when you feed it to her
And take that little thumb when you give me to her
'cause you was packin' now you're lackin'
You used to be stackin' when you was the mackin'
But that's alright, it's a small thing, a small thing
A two-minute brother, girls, I stress a small thing
Yo, back to the track in the matter
I don't need to see you think you're all of thatta
Regardless of you my purse and pockets will be fatter
I leaved ya flat, I leave ya flat, I left ya flatter
CHORUS
I wouldn't take ya back if ya paid me
It was so sweet, oh no, I can't believe ya played me
I'll admit you pulled it off kinda well
But guess what? I did it, too, so what the hell?
You reap what you sow, you know, you know how that go
I know you're kinda shocked, but it was you who showed me so
Swallow your pride, take it in, be a man
I understood, now you understand
That the minute you started showing me neglect
Is the same minute I started feeling the effect
Why I held it in I didn't wanna accept
That it could be over just for cheap sex
Experience is what we need to learn from
I know we all made mistakes, but you're a big one
So to the lucky man who's up next
Either treat me right or just step (step-step)
CHORUS
