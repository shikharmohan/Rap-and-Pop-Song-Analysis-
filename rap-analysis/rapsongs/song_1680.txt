Made in America, where ya placed on the totem pole
I got soul 'cause I'm a black man, never sellin' crack and
Track the police, the facts I release
Go straight through your ear to the mind
Listen, just cause this man is white I won't dis him
I'll enlist him, work with the system
It's a big country, ain't nobody's flunky
Be cool, don't lose control
'Cause a fool will scold someone else before himself
There ain't no need to be hurt
Proceed to be alert, the seed is in the dirt
When you ain't got nowhere else to look
You're gonna find 'em there
And the time you shared, time together
Maybe climb together, but if it don't work out
Still don't doubt or pout, it's out in the open
Hopin' that it ain't scarin' ya, this is made in America
Made in America, made where? Made in America
Made where? Made in America
Where dat at? Made in America
I'ma have it made in America, paid in America
Bring about a raid in your area
Who's controllin' who? You controllin' you
Don't let no one tell you what to do
You your own person
I be thirstin' for more information to deal with the nation
Be forewarned, the more informed you are
Will help you swarm the farther regions
So please begin, ask your elders
I'm sure they'll tell ya where ya came from
If ya brain's numb from wonderin'
Where did ya come from then?
Ask your moms to drop the bomb
Just remember black is black, no matter the shade
Just be glad that she gave birth to you, it might hurt ya too
But you gotta wonderful life, so take it light, yo
Racial tensions makes ya fist tense
It's a cinch when you don't get alarmed
I'm strong and mighty just politely preparin' ya
If ya made in America
'Cause then they always fearin'
Ya need a strong foundation
When ya placin' stationed in America
Made in America, made where? Made in America
Made where? Made in America
Where dat at? Made in America
