Close your eyes visualize
Space and I verbalize you chastize
But can't stop my enterprize
Put your rhymes in a line
Put your raps in a stack
I'll break you and your singer like Jinga
I mean um I spit like knee
On you this tight thing
Space nine inferno
One verbs be frightening
And for the sword fights tonight
My entourage is in camoflauge
Remove your mask
Let down your visage but don't slip up
'Cause when I was in my ship up
That's when I get ripped up
The whole world  fuck it
G S E committee
Got your panties shitty
Click you sick
Callosso with itty bitty
Space and Missy
Sip my style till your pissy
Virgina bitch galactic
I'll be writing rhymes, writing rhymes everyday
Don't you say no more you don't want to battle
Said I'm writing rhymes writing rhymes everyday
Don't you say no more you don't want to battle
Mama Daddy you ain't ready
Act like you know me
Fly, as friends be sizzling, I'm chilling
Man, you twisting you sissy, you this me
You wish me, he was fucking you tight
Auntie, Papa, smoke lala
Hallah, fala, don't bother to swalla
This bottle of Remmy got plenty of weed
So give me give me, give me please
See's no one fly like these
Bees from overseas
We scratch our knees
Please little one please
You know my rhymes get tight
When I smoke all night
I be writing rhymes, writing rhymes everyday
Don't you say no more, you don't want to battle
Said I'm writing rhymes, writing rhymes everyday
Don't you say no more, you don't want to battle
We high tech like Timbo's
Slap faces of dirty hoes
N Y M B A
A dirty combo when we play
Swirl like the milky way
Deep like my black hole
I oppose to expose
Chemical gases up your nose
Fade away like ozone
Quazars moves and shit
Hey yo Missy where the clip?
I think I need a hit
Shitty bees up in the place
Wanna be down with whoever
Be all up in his face but ain't even on the level
I pull your wig back
Let of steam like nasty pools
That heat be to hot
Melt down now up in pot
Count down, 3-2-1, lift off
Now over tize Venus we circlize
And mars we tantalize
Comatize like hale-bopp
Smoking trees non stop
Then I send a televize from satelite on nightline
Yeah, wouldn't you like to get away to the moon?
We shine like stars
Lock down like metal bars
I be writing rhymes, writing rhymes everyday
Don't you say no more, you don't want to battle
Said I'm writing rhymes, writing rhymes everyday
Don't you say no more, you don't want to battle
My style is a one in a million
I flow on and on and on
My rhymes give you a pretty good feeling
All day long we won't
My style is a one in a million
I flow on and on and on
My rhymes give you a really good feeling
All day long
