It's our identity all me, no ghost no 16 bit like Sega Genesis
All G ball on the ball soundtrack on the track
Gemini on the job Shayla G on the
G Sarah green for the green free chilly
And I'm back on my thing for the listeners
What you are about to, to witness is Lu new valuable album 2
Get ready for the ghetto, ghetto images
From the M A D I to the S to the O N
Potent so get your oak pen
Move like a nigga supposed to
Get your dough on the go with the flow that I'm holdin'
I'm on my go go go go go go go go go, go gadget flow
I got my go go go go go go go go go, go gadget flow
I got my go go go go go go go go go, go gadget flow
I got my go go go go go go go go go, go gadget flow
Love, got the windy city on my back
So I'm back on my grizzle like a bearskin' rug
Put some lain on the floor blame it on the goat
Little rapper turn it out 'cuz I'm very pluh
I convert I can work anywhere
Any word you can ask my brother huh
He'll concur that I'm sers with the worst
With the man up above thank you very much
That I got what I got and I'm at where I'm at
Like an a in a circle with a pay little erkel
What they say when they see OG
From the F to the F to the amazin' verbals
They race in circles like they raisin' a gerbil
I race in a circle like I'm raisin' a horse
I'm racin' a Porsche while they racin' in place
They race in a cage, I race on a course, course
That case in the court did not defer the dream
I am still a raisin' man with sun ragin' against the machine
From the M A D I to the S to the O N
Potent so get your oak pen
Move like a nigga supposed to
Get your dough on the go with the flow that I'm holdin'
I got my go go go go go go go go go, go gadget flow
I got my go go go go go go go go go, go gadget flow
I got my go go go go go go go go go, go gadget flow
I got my go go go go go go go go go, go gadget flow

Hey, hey, don't hate on me
My tank on full, your tank on E
Look good on you look good on me
'Cuz I'ma go and never gon' S T O P
Like hey, hey, don't hate on me
My tank on full your tank on E
Look good on you, look good on me
'Cuz I'ma go and never gon' S T O P
Like hey, hey, I'm the boss
Rock genuine time not De Lacoste
Neon clean and Phenom jeans
Little rap is like azemof
I let my momma into rhymin' and she raised me off
A 80s baby on file like a safety off
Got my hood ridin' high on 28s
Off of everythin' that's gon' be like a 84
And they in love with him and I'm in love with them
And we never ride dubs again no we won't
Tryin' get a butter rim a little too short to dunk
So we dock
From the M A D I to the S to the O N
Potent so get your oak pen
Move like a nigga supposed to
Get your dough on the go with the flow
I'm on my go go go go go go go go go, go gadget flow
I got my go go go go go go go go go, go gadget flow
