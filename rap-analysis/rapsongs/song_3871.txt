Intro: Puffy
I am not wit that standin around lookin cool and shit
I want ya motherfuckers to jump the fuck up
and have some motherfuckin fun
You understand what it means to be black?
I have my man the Notorious B.I.G in the back
I go by the name of the Puff Daddy
But check this shit out
Four fives
As we procced to give you whut you need
Verse One: Notorious B.I.G
Sick of ma screamin get a job nigga
Pressed to the limit gotta rob me a nigga
Simple and plain, my man scooped me in the hooptie
Whispered in his ear, this is what we gotta do G
We gots to bang a nigga, and bang a nigga good
So I could cop a benz and drive the fuck out the hood
Cause baby mama screamin, your daughter twelve months
Can't live life slingin rocks and smokin blunts
Hangin with the niggaz don't pay the bills
And bein broke and dirty give the nigga chills
So what we gots to do is creep and see a sweet vic
Did you see that shit? (hell yea I see that shit)
Columbian Dominican yea whatever
Who ever he was he had a tuck under the leather
Two keys twenty G's nigga please
Blew his brains out cause witnesses we don't need
Chorus: Notorious B.I.G. (repeat 2X)
On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggaz do real things
Hanging wit the bitches is the song I sing
Real niggaz do real things
Verse Two: Puff Daddy
Yea, yea, yea, yea
I tote gats wit my nigga
Clap wit my nigga
Break bread then break backs wit my nigga
jack wit my nigga
Cock the latch wit my nigga
Now how you gonna act wit my nigga
Just remember there is a gun to your dome
And i will lick shots and run through your home
Or better yet i put your son to the chrome
Turn the music up and unplug the phone
I will kill him read my lips
You too motherfucker if i dont see no bricks
See I flips when I dont see no chips

Yo fuck that I am gonna check these niggaz

Put a contract out and stop ya lungs

Mama bitch squezze the life out of ya niggas
Screw barker i take bites out of ya niggaz
Crack open ya safe then put a bomb to it

With the all black hoodie beat a nigga till he hurl
Then pull the hoodie off so he can see it was a girl
When it comes to my nigga B.I.G
I wanna see all ya niggaz D.I.E

Real niggaz do real things
On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggaz do real things
Hanging wit the bitches is the song I sing
Real niggaz do real things
