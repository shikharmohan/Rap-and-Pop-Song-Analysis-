Woop, woop, that's the sound of da police
Woop, woop, that's the sound of da beast
Woop, woop, that's the sound of da police
Woop, woop, that's the sound of da beast
Yes, indeed
Woop, woop, that's the sound of da police
Woop, woop, that's the sound of da beast
Woop, woop, that's the sound of da police
Woop, woop, that's the sound of da beast
Yes, indeed
Stand clear, don' man a talk, you can't stand where I stand
You can't walk where I walk, watch out, we run New York
Police man come, we bust him out the park
I know this for a fact, you don't like how I act
You claim I'm sellin' crack but you be doin' that
I'd rather say "See ya" 'cause I would never be ya
Be a officer? You wicked overseer
Ya hotshot, wanna get props and be a saviour
First show a little respect, change your behavior
Change your attitude, change your plan
There could never really be justice on stolen land
Are you really for peace and equality? Or when my car is hooked up
You know you wanna follow me, your laws are minimal
'Cause you won't even think about lookin' at the real criminal
This has got to cease
'Cause we be getting hyped to the sound of da police
Woop, woop, that's the sound of da police
Woop, woop, that's the sound of da beast
Woop, woop, that's the sound of da police
Woop, woop, that's the sound of da beast
Now, here's a likkle truth open up your eye
While you're checking out the boom box, check the exercise
Take the word "Overseer," like a sample
Repeat it very quickly in a crew for example
Overseer, overseer, overseer, overseer
Officer, Officer, Officer, Officer, yeah, officer from overseer
You need a little clarity? Check the similarity
The overseer rode around the plantation
The officer is off patroling all the nation
The overseer couldn't stop you what you're doing
The officer will pull you over just when he's pursuing
The overseer had the right to get ill
And if you fought back, the overseer had the right to kill
The officer has the right to arrest
And if you fight back they put a hole in your chest
Woop, they both ride horses
After 400 years, I've got no choices
The police them have a little gun
So when I'm on the streets, I walk around with a bigger one
Woop, woop, I hear it all day
Just so they can run the light and be upon their way
Yes, indeed
Yes, indeed
Yes, indeed
Yes, indeed
Woop, woop, that's the sound of da police
Woop, woop, that's the sound of da beast
Woop, woop, that's the sound of da police
Woop, woop, that's the sound of da beast
Check out the message in a rough stylee
The real criminals are the COP
You check for undercover and the one PD
But just a mere Black man, them want check me
Them check out me car for it shine like the sun
But them jealous or them vexed 'cause them can't afford one
Black people still slaves up 'til today
But the Black police officer nah see it that way
Him want a salary, him want it
So he put on a badge and kill people for it
My grandfather had to deal with the cops
My great-grandfather dealt with the cops
My great-grandfather had to deal with the cops
And then my great, great, great, great, when it's gonna stop?
Woop, woop, that's the sound of da police
