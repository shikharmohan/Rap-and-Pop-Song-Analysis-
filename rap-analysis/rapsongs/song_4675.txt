When you was seventeen and I was nineteen
We feel deep in love growing up in Queens
We didn't know a thing about love
We was innocent sneakin' on the doorstep to hug
Held you tightly and promised you the world
You gave me hickeys and said you was my girl
When I think about it now makes me smile
'Cause I ain't felt these butterflies in a while
Funny how you grow up and innocence fades
We used to live for love but now we're afraid
Of the darkness and bitter memories
Lovers who crushed us through infidelity
I promised you I'd love you to the end
Always and forever since way back when
You're like candy the world's sweetest friend
You taste better now than you did back then
You will always be my candy
One day we will start a family
You will always be my candy girl
(You'll be my candy girl forever)
You will always be my candy
Want your love girl understand me
You will always be my candy girl
While you sucked caramel apple lolly pops
Rain sleet or snow I'm troopin' up the Murdock
We used to walk down the block holdin' hands
I would get you after school 'cause I was your man
And any guys that wanna socialize
Just know that I'm a flip on any cat that try's
My peeps used to say I was whipped
All your girls said since you got with him you flipped
But uh they couldn't feel the feelings we felt
Mirrors on the ceiling we melt
I would look up at ya, I remember
The afternoon you surrendered
We made love, the temperature was high as could be
You said,"Todd, promise you ain't lyin' to me"
And as we went our separate ways you turned back
Smiled I remember all that
You will always be my candy
One day we will start a family
You will always be my candy girl
(You'll be my candy girl forever)
You will always be my candy
Want your love girl understand me
You will always be my candy girl
(Take it to the bridge)
Candy girl
You are my world
Look so sweet
You're a special treat
Candy girl
All I want to say
I need your love
Each and every day
When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear my memories call
Of days when love was true I slept and held you
Taste the brown sugar, let your climax melt you
Candy, you're occupying all of my thoughts
Turned my soul upside down with lessons you taught
I can feel you even when you're far away you're right here wit' me
Sweet love strictly
And I'm a bend over backwards to keep you on my side
Take you for a mental and emotional ride
Make love to your soul your heart and your mind
In your hour of need girl I'll be there every time
And as long as you support my dreams
Stayin' right beside me as a part of my team
I'ma take you where the average man can only dream of
'Cause in a world so sour I got the sweetest love
You will always be my candy
One day we will start a family
You will always be my candy girl
(You'll be my candy girl forever)
You will always be my candy
Want your love girl understand me
You will always be my candy girl
Candy girl
You are my world
Look so sweet
You're a special treat
(You'll be my candy girl forever)
Candy girl
All I want to say
(Word is bond sweetheart)
I need your love
  (I swear I'm down for whatever)
Candy girl
(Sometimes you gotta go back home)
Look so sweet
(I love you)
Candy girl
