There's no such thing as a government
There's only people rulin' over people
People jerkin' around people
People lendin' a hand to people
What part of the system do you play?
Who do you oppress? Uhh
What kinda world are we livin' in? Yo
What kinda world are we livin' in?
Can I get with my people?
Can I sit with my people?
Break bread with my people?
Move ahead with my people?
What kinda world are we livin' in? Yo
What kinda world are we livin' in?
Can I get with my people?
When every day
Seven thousand kids are gettin' locked up
When every day
The justice system seems to stay stocked up
When every day
They cuttin' 'em down 'fore they even pop up
When every day
You gotta duck 'fore you get shot up
What kinda world are we livin' in
Spinnin' in, winnin' in, sinnin' in?
Let us begin again
Churches are run like corporations makin' me holla
Corporations are run like churches praisin' the dollar
There's no way out, or is it? Release your doubt and live it
Teachin' metaphysics don't listen to these critics, hear it
What kinda world are we livin' in?
Believe in yourself, achieve for yourself, see for yourself
Speak for yourself, never weaken yourself by deceivin' yourself
Believe in your wealth, c'mon
What kinda world are we livin' in? Yo
What kinda world are we livin' in?
Can I get with my people?
Can I sit with my people?
Break bread with my people?
Move ahead with my people?
Yo, yo, yeah
What kinda world are we livin' out?
We move about in fear and doubt, tryin' to get more clout
Just check it, check it out, we took the wrong route
To a morality drought, basically I'm callin' 'em out
What kinda world are we livin' in
When a song will not get on
Unless it talks 'bout thongs
Now where did we go wrong? We don't have long
Preference all torn, all worn not norm and all gone
What kinda world do we live around, when we lay around
Let me break it down, they shuttin' us down
While we play around, we fallin', stallin'
While God's callin', all in to fall in
What kinda world are we livin' in? Yo
What kinda world are we livin' in?
Can I get with my people?
Can I sit with my people?
Break bread with my people?
Move ahead with my people?
What kinda world are we livin' in? Yo
What kinda world are we livin' in?
Can I get with my people?
When every day
Another unwanted pregnancy ends
When every day
Another person is betrayed by a friend
When every day
It never ends, and the people pretend like
The President is there 'cause of them
Let me ask
What kinda world can we really trust
When the cops they can shoot at us? Bo bo
What kinda world can we really grow
(Ohh)
When our daughters wanna be hoes?
(Ohh)
And a father that nobody knows
(Ohh)
And a mother wearin' them sexy clothes
(Ho)
What kinda world are we livin' in, yo?
What kinda world are we livin' in, uhh?
