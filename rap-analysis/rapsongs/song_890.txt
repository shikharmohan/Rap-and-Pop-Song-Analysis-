Aye yo, oh baby, what I feel is just the
The type of shit that make you act stupid for real, but what the
Ya'll, before ya try to wear these you need to hear these
Welcome all ya'll to my world series
Elaborate on Busta Rhymes theories
I could bust your ass on behalf of all MC's
Never disrespect these monumental creating new flow
The full blast we'll hit'em hit'em, hit'em high, hit'em low
And while your style will soften, then my mind will drift often
To illusions of my lyrics givin' you massages in the coffin
The boom shock oh wee horny nigga crash into a motherfuckin' tree
I visualize shit when we in the place to be
Extra strength nigga better's to mind the party
Full fears I just piss off in the place
Make the spot look scarce or pass needles in ya face
Fuck dumb shit straight up
Keep it bouncin' baby make sure you hold your wait up, A hah
Yeah, just watch how the flow will change up for sure
Rippin' until my niggas walk out the door
All my niggas dirty, hungry and thirsty

Ya'll, I refuse to lose, look at the news and read the interviews
Flipmode is da squad a unit made of many crews
Give me the whole entire wheel of fortune
Makin' a sacrifice no matter what the shit be costin'
And while you coughin' I be flossin' like a fuckin' dolphin
A lot of bitch rich niggas experience extortion
Since I was born when I perform
I drop a million in a one stony rocks on niggas like a fuckin' hailstorm
I pull neutral my new flow, put on your funeral home suit
Then executed with a bang shoop
The blow torch has been ignited, those who so excited
I'm about  bunch of bitch niggas and they extradited
You soundin' so sloppy
Like a broken muffler draggin' behind an older lobby
Once the bomb drops here's to aftermath
Scientist tried to dissect the way I formulate my craft
Worrying 'bout how I achieve things
And the way I analyze shit and how I percieve things
My style is real like bear skin imported from the Persian
Follow my excurtion all the way till you feelin' the newer vibe version
I complete the after feat destroy who ever complicate the way how I eat
Survival hungry nigga
All my niggas dirty, hungry and thirsty
Hit ya like 30 30 for watcha worst see
Ya know we got to get this money
