Georgia rose, Georgia rose
You're the most precious rose Dixie grows
Though it don't seem quite right
'Cause your skin's dark as night
I know you've heart full of light
To the good Lord above
We all look the same
So, don't hang your head in shame
Georgia rose, Georgia rose
Don't be blue 'cause you're black
Georgia rose
Georgia rose, Georgia rose
Don't be blue 'cause you're black
Georgia rose
