Yeah, this one goes out to all the ladies in the house
I need two to stand by me when the chips are down
And stick around while I defend my crown
And no sell-out, the trip is too rough
And I'll blow your skin to sofa, leave your mind to be tough
And I may seem rough but life is much rougher
To see success sometimes you gotta suffer
I need a woman that's stronger than material needs
And isn't motivated by greed
Dry my tear-drops and feelin' my pain
And watchin' my back while I strive to maintain
And makin' love like a medicine doctor
I knew that she was bad from the day that I clocked her
Stand by your man, stand by your man
  (You got to stand by your baby)
Stand by your man, stand by your man
  (You got to stand by your man)
My enemies come and my break-bread's tough
But you recognize game from your eyes and walkin'
Baby, ain't no way I'll let the vultures attack you
So I'll teach you the game and tell you how to react to
The conversation, sexy vibration
Visual stimulation, slick persuasion
Times is hard, I need a woman that rolls with God
And the only man she loves is Todd
But will you be around when the raindrops fallin'
Or could it be you never loved me at all?
And I need a trooper, a soldier, a agent
I need someone who can roll with my arrangement
The reap reducer factor
And the Queen of the Universe, not a actor
And standin' by her man till the end
Not only as a lover but a friend
Stand by your man, stand by your man
  (You got to stand by your baby)
Stand by your man, stand by your man
  (You got to stand by your man)
Men, will things get better?
We can look back at the whole operators
Remember the times when they said I couldn't do it
But I was rougher than rough and baby you knew it
And you held back when your loved jobs called in
You had faith when they said that I'd fallin'
You understood that what we had was good
You stood by your man like a real queen should
That's why now I got you livin' your dream
As a beautiful wisdom, a part of my team
And as long as I live on this earth
Anything you want is what your loyalty's worth
Stand by your man, stand by your man
  (You got to stand by your baby)
Stand by your man, stand by your man
  (I wanna send this one out to all the ladies in the house)
(You got to stand by your man)
Stand by your man, stand by your man
  (You got to stand by your baby)
Stand by your man, stand by your man
  (You got to stand by your man)
You got to stand by your baby
You got to stand by your man
Stand by your man, stand by your man
  (You got to stand by your baby)
Stand by your man, stand by your man
  (You got to stand by your man)
Stand by your man, stand by your man
  (You got to stand by your baby)
You got to stand by your man
You got to stand by your baby
Stand by your man, stand by your man
  (You got to stand by your man)
