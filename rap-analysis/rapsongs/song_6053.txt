[Queen Latifah]
Southside, Northside
Eastside, Westside
Alright, alright
Alright, we ride
[Verse: 1]
Ain't the paper, that makes me Dana
I just see the strangers they look at me stranger
They all give me more lip
So I give ya more music, more scrips' Less actin'
I stepped up to salary cappin'
Passin' traffic and lookin' what happened
See how life takes a turn (uh huh)
More paper earned
Lawyers poof, case adjourned good-bye
I am what I am, I come from Newark
So crÃÃÂ¨me de la crÃÃÂ¨me (uh yeah)
specially when, yall pray for my downfall
That's why I try to stay from round y'all (let's go)
Turn my days in the dark, they find less (let's go)
Like metter maids when I park but I'll be
Still, doin' me, still so beautifully 
I pray to brushin' off haters for stuff the do to me
[Chorus: Mario Winans]
Go and do your thing
'cause people will talk 
Baby it's the way
The way that you walk
Keep your head up to the sky
Comfort is high
Love the ones that hate you
'cause they're the ones who make you
Go and do your thing
[Verse: 2]
Yo, yo, yo
Now just imagine how the world'll be witchu cruisin'  
Top down, popped the blouse, get girls aroused 
Talk bout shoppin n browsin 
not for clothes and copped the house
Could it be that you feel you need me?
Hey, you love the way I flow 'cause it comes to easy
When life imitate art thats where the hatin' start
You gotta love dat, try to stay above that
Who knew I'd come this far
Business woman, and movie star?
My moms always told me I come from God
And the stress that come from y'all keep achin'
You be there keep waiting
Keep trying be patient
Y'all wish I can stay the night 
And really feel the love 'cause my fans provide it
[Chorus: Mario Winans]
Go and do your thing
'cause people will talk 
Baby it's the way
The way that you walk
Keep your head up to the sky
Comfort is high
Love the ones that hate you
'cause they're the ones who make you
Go and do your thing
[Verse: 3]
Lately, it just seems to me 
That people ain't what they seem to be
They all want me torn up
I know there's snakes in the grass
So I pay my staff, to keep the lawns cut
I see all the drama you bringin'
I combat that with possitive thinking
I'm me till I'm old and grey
and when that day comes
I gonna teach my daughters do be the same way
I am the way I am, I'm from the hood
So crÃÃÂ¨me de le crÃÃÂ¨me
And specially when, yall pray for my downfall
That's why I try to stay from round y'all (that's why_
You never keep me down
So I'll always be around, forget about it
Still doin' it, (still doin me)
So beautifully I see you rushin' them papers that aint new to me
[Chorus: Mario Winans X2]
Go and do your thing
'cause people will talk 
Baby it's the way
The way that you walk
Keep your head up to the sky
Comfort is high
Love the ones that hate you
'cause they're the ones who make you
Go and do your thing
[Ending: Mario Winans]
Just do your thing
'cause people gon' hate you anyway uh
Just do your thing
'cause people gonna hate you anyway uh
Just do your thing y'all c'mon 
Can nobody stop me y'all c'mon
We Yellow City y'all
We gon' keep doin' our thing, keep doin' our thing
