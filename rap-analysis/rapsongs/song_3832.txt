I'm as real as real can get
As real can get, get
What you see is what you get
Ay, I know you see me on the screen now, right
I know you see me do my thing now, true
Tryin' hard not to stare, actin' like I wasn't there for you
Can you see me now? Am I clear to you?
On the red carpet in Mark Jacob's clothes
You see me fashion week, front row at all the shows
In your favorite fashion magazine, they feature the Queen
On the cover of Don Divas, doin' spreads with Eva
When we walk down the street, dudes call us the cover girl
We stand out when we next to them other girls
I don't bend easy, budge or break
Trust me, ju don't want it with the female Scarface
Your girl come through twirlin' in drop top 'Rossa'
Me and my la familia like a 'Goodfellas' poster
You see I'm somethin' you never seen befo'
I know you see me 'cause I'm somethin' that you came to know, oh
(I know you see me)
Dipped fresh, hoppin' out of a Rolls
(I know you see me)
In the town, ballin' out of control
(I know you see me)
V V S's set in platinum and gold
(I know you see me)
Standin' room only, all of my shows
(I know you see me)
Applebottom bustin' out of my jeans
(I know you see me)
On the screen with the man of your dreams
(I know you see me)
Front page of your new magazines
(I know you see me)
Ay show some love, papers stack, I'm the Queen bitch
And you should see me in the summertime
Stretched out in one of my drop tops
All you hip-hop bitches borderline
  (I know you see me)
I'm livin' off of your man, he supportin' ma
You'd kill me if I give you the chance, bitch I was born to shine
While you on your grind I'm on, beach front property
Thirty-eight snub nose, keep the snitches off of me
  (I know you see me)
Look the rest of your life, ain't gon' find a bitch as raw as me
Grateful's what you oughta be, I heard somewhere it cost to be
The boss and I paid it, floss with the greatest
Ball outrageous the broad is amazin'
In the 6, grippin' woodgrain lane changin'
You coach flyin' hoes need boss bitch trainin'
I'm muy caliente sizzlin' hot flame
  (I know you see me)
In private planes to Spain and you barely maintainin'
You ain't talkin' millions, you ain't speakin' my language
The Queen of the game and can't a damn thing change it
(I know you see me)
Dipped fresh, hoppin' out of a Rolls
(I know you see me)
In the town, ballin' out of control
(I know you see me)
V V S's set in platinum and gold
(I know you see me)
Standin room only, all of my shows
(I know you see me)
Applebottom bustin' out of my jeans
(I know you see me)
On the screen with the man of your dreams
(I know you see me)
Front page of your new magazines
(I know you see me)
Ay show some love, papers stack, I'm the Queen bitch
What you see is what you get
Lil' Kim Queen Bee is real, as real can get
(What you see is what you get)
I'm a certified hustler, so cut that check
Raised in the streets of Brooklyn, what you expect?
(What you see is what you get)
What you see, what you see
What you see is what you get
What you see, what you see
What you see is what you get
(I know you see me)
Dipped fresh, hoppin' out of a Rolls
(I know you see me)
In the town, ballin' out of control
(I know you see me)
V V S's set in platinum and gold
(I know you see me)
Standin room only, all of my shows
(I know you see me)
Applebottom bustin' out of my jeans
(I know you see me)
On the screen with the man of your dreams
(I know you see me)

(I know you see me)
Ay show some love, papers stack, I'm the Queen bitch
What you see, what you see
What you see is what you get
