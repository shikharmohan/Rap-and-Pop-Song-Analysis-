I don't give a fuck, till I die, I'ma live it up
Hit 'em up, nigga what? What? Nigga what?
Better watch yo' ass 'fore I pull the choppers out the stash
And helicopter yo' ass, about a block and a half
'Cause I'ma ride for my niggaz, die for my niggaz
Puff lye with my niggaz, till I'm high with my niggaz
Where you at, Prop?
Ai yo, it's off with his head
Let the bloodshed, 'cause all my thug sons'll bust lead
Yo, I rep like one of the best, my mac numbin' your flesh
They on tracks but they runnin' from death
Who fuckin' respect, yo dog, I'm the youngest to rep
Comin' correct, niggaz know I blow my gun in a sec
'Cause I'ma ride for my niggaz, die for my niggaz
Puff lye with my niggaz till I'm high with my niggaz
What the deal, Twin?
Yeah baby, ai yo, it's off with his head
Slap the shit out the devil and tear his horns off his head
Ai yo, it's almost over, few months we all gon' know Jehovah
Till then I'ma keep the steel in the shoulder holster
I ain't ready to die, bury me alive
But if my nigga got beef, we goin' together tonight
'Cause I'ma ride for my niggaz, die for my niggaz
Puff lye with my niggaz till I'm high with my niggaz
What you say, Twin?
Ai yo, it's off with his head
Left a body stiff and dead with the infrared
It's hard to survive, [Incomprehensible] armor hold this tribe
And takin' niggaz lives, so what, they tryin' take mine
What I'm supposed to do? Let shit slide like I was close to you
This murder I write, pushin' a hearse, let me chauffeur you
'Cause I'ma ride for my niggaz, die for my niggaz
Puff lye with my niggaz till I'm high with my niggaz
What the deal, son?
Ai yo, it's off with his head
Nigga, I was born in the fuckin' Dawn of the Dead
I always got my Dunn like I always got my gun
Fresh out the box, oiled and cocked, Glock 21
Once I have a gun to pop, I ain't gon' stop till I'm done
So either call the cops, or bust a shot, nigga, uh
'Cause I'ma ride for my niggaz, die for my niggaz
Puff lye with my niggaz till I'm high with my niggaz
Hold me down Pros'
Ai yo, it's off with his head
Put that nigga to sleep and make a coffin' his bed
I come from rough times where niggaz bust 9's and be like fuck rhymes
And puff dimes, slippin' on front lines and lust crimes
You better trust mines, I'm down for the 'cause
Gimme a round of applause and hear the sound of the 4's
'Cause I'ma ride for my niggaz, die for my niggaz
Puff lye with my niggaz till I'm high with my niggaz
What the deal, kid?
Ai yo, it's off with his head
Cock the lead redecorate the crib burgundy red
Ai yo, I never front, I want whatever nigga let's dump
Whoever want it gonna get lift with the pump
I mention I'm dumb, my trigger finger fittin' to jump
Got the whole left side of my face twitchin' and stuff
'Cause I'ma ride for my niggaz, die for my niggaz
Puff lye with my niggaz till I'm high with my niggaz
Take us home, Dunn
Ai yo, it's off with his head
He ain't really want it so he lost it instead
Picture me rollin like 'Pac in the drop
My style too hot to figure out
Oh Lord, please don't make me put this nigga out
My trigger shout through your area code
The scary explos', your click get, leary of foes
'Cause I'ma ride for my niggaz, die for my niggaz
Puff lye with my niggaz till I'm high with my niggaz
Now it's on Twin, now it's on Twin
Yeah, now it's on Twin
