Thanks to jigga@hot.ee for these lyrics.  It starts like this  Just cock and lick it  Gats hit harder than fists  The aftermath's wicked  Brass gets evicted  Can't put your strap back in your waist  Another crew shot  Cause your barrel's too hot  You did it kid  The more dead  The more weight on your head  Plus you ganked a suitcase  Full of black tar H  Baby boy, twenty keys  Dead Colombian Gs  One slip you bleed  Now you're ballin full speed  You had your nigga with you  Hard rock street gorilla hitter  Now he's bendin over  He took a hot one in the shoulder  Mad illegal  Nigga flipped harder than Buggsy Segal  Desert eagle  Blood oozin through his black dickies  He wet the room up with the rocket launchin  Ya nigga say he's getting dizzy  The car seat's fuckin getting sticky  He leaned back, his whole chest plate's cracked  You thought they hit him once  He must of got double clapped  Your niggas dyin but he ain't cryin  Soldier no doubt  He looked you dead in the eye  Said "get that money" checked out  Ballin bent him back in the black  S T S but where he's going no stress  Your niggas dead, but you're thinkin bout head  Fly hoes and condos  Once you flip the kilos  The fact your niggas out aint shit to ya  More profit for your greedy ass  No one to split the grip wit ya   Common sense will keep you safer than vests  LA streets will make your guts leak  Chorus:  Ambulance, cots, cause real niggas give head shots  Player no doubt  Young killers live for drug wars and shoot outs   You flipped your chip  Motorola, called your hooker  Told the ho to wet some towels up  Said you had a little foul up  She didn't even talk  Clicked the phone off  But this bitch aint soft  Make your next call  Might a new some weak niggas  Straight to your chicano connect  Said they would flip the boy for girl  Up the weight, give you Peruvian flake  You had to dump the body,  Burned it beyond recognition  Back back in commission  Scooped your hooker, cleaned your seats off  Two in her head  Squeezed off  Now the fuckin bitch is dead  Straight laced hustler from hell  You're all alone just how you liked it  Street life you spiked it It's time to hook up with the mexicanos  Layin in the Dooly parking lot of a McDonalds  Hit the corner they was there  You're prepared  Circled the block, screwed your silencer on  Rock the esse they had  Kickin back to get ya  Crept on the dropped truck  Check the back of the cab  Double crossin ducks got bucked  Suckas had the fuckin math  Ten more keys of uncut pure cash (Yes!)  Now your weighin thirty full keys  Of girl and the pony  Jumped for your lack  Hit the yack threw your head back  The big time is what you wanted  The devil put the strap in your palm  And now you got it  And you shot it   Chorus  It's going down now   On forever  Square life is never  Buck wildin is your life stylin  Mashed out  Hit a motel room  Crashed out  Called up a ho to get your dick sucked though  Bad bitch phat backs green contacts  Real hair, kept her feet all night in the air  Kind of square  Said she only worked the streets a week  Said her boyfriend kicked her out  And she needed to eat  She cuddled to you like a baby  Keep the girl mabey  The pussy was tighter than fuck drove you crazy  She kissed you on your chest and legs  Then she started to beg  Asked you to fuck her in the ass  It kind of got you open, no doubt  When baby doll fell asleep, with your dick in her mouth  Now you're layin there, lookin at the motel door  Hand on your strap, some beautiful whore  You fuckin relaxed, fell a fuckin sleep bad move  Big game take little game, show and prove  Baby jumped up, went for the strap  Dumped off  Don't forget, grab the blow then jet  Three shots in your face Grabbed the sutcase  Before that ho hit the door she sipped a glass of Moet  Street life sabatoge  Niggas wanna live large  Demon ho out for cheddar  Capped you with your own Berreta  Chorus
