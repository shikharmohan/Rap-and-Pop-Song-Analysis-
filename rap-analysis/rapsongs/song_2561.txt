My love'll give it to you girl

My love'll give it to you girl 
Deliver it to you girl

My love I'll give it to you girl 
Just give it to me girl 
I wanna rock yo world 
I heard about it happenin' 
I never thought it could be 
The way he looked into my eyes 
What he doin' to me 
He caught me by surprise 
He opened up my life 
He wasn't like them other dudes 
I wanna be his wife 
He said he got played 
I told him don't be scared 
My mission make you mine 
Forget the rest 
They ain't prepared 
He said he liked my style 
I said I liked his lips 
He took my hand 
And put them to my hips 
My love'll give it to you girl 
Deliver it to you girl 
I wanna rock with you girl 
My love I'll give it to you girl 
Just give it to me girl 
I wanna rock yo world 
My love'll give it to you girl 
Deliver it to you girl 
I wanna rock with you girl 
My love I'll give it to you girl 
Just give it to me girl 
I wanna rock yo world 
You ever let a dude 
You can't get out yo mind 
You go to sleep 
He in your dreams 
He with you all the time 
This was the way it was 
Thought it was meant to be 
Till I picked up the phone one night 
And it was Tiffany 
She said he was her dude 
I said is that a fact 
She said I let him go and play 
But he always come back 
I said that can't be true 
She said it always is 
I hung up, heart stuck 
No relationship 
My love'll give it to you girl 
Deliver it to you girl 
I wanna rock with you girl 
My love I'll give it to you girl 
Just give it to me girl 
I wanna rock yo world 
My love'll give it to you girl 
Deliver it to you girl 
I wanna rock with you girl 
My love I'll give it to you girl 
Just give it to me girl 
I wanna rock yo world 
Hearts keep on beatin' 
Better take a walk girl 
Give it to you 
Give it to me 
Me give it to you 
Me give it to you 
Come on come on 
My love'll give it to you girl 
Deliver it to you girl 
I wanna rock with you girl 
My love I'll give it to you girl 
Just give it to me girl 
I wanna rock yo world
