(Dedicated to Notorious B.I.G.) 
(Puff) 
Yeah... this right here (tell me why)
Goes out, to everyone, that has lost someone
That they truly loved (c'mon, check it out)
Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show 
I laced the track you locked the flow 
So far from hanging on the block of dough 
Notorious, they got to know that! 
Life ain't always what it seems to be 
Words can't express what you mean to me 
Even though you're gone 
We still a team 
Through your family I'll fulfill your dreams 
In the future can't wait to see 
If you'll open up the gates for me 
Reminisce  sometime 
The night they took my friend 
Try to black it out but it plays again 
When it's real feelings' hard to conceal 
Can't imagine all the pain I feel 
Give anything to hear half your breath 
I know you still livin' your life after death 
CHORUS: (Faith) 
Every step I take 
Every move I make 
Every single day 
Every time I pray 
I'll be missing you 
Thinking of the day 
When you went away 
What a life to take 
What a bond to break 
I'll be missing you 
(Puff) 
It's kinda hard with you not around 
Know you're in heaven smilin' down 
Watchin' us while we pray for you 
Everyday we pray for you 
Till the day we meet again 
In my heart is where I'll keep you friend 
Memories give me the strength I need to proceed 
Strength I need to believe 
My thoughts,Big, I just can't define 
Wish I could turn back the hands of time 
Us in the 6 
Shop for new clothes and kicks 
You and me taking flicks 
Making hits stages they receive you on 
Still can't believe you're gone 
Give anything to hear half your breath 
I know you still livin' your life after death 
CHORUS: (Faith) 
Every step I take 
Every move I make 
Every single day 
Every time I pray 
I'll be missing you 
Thinking of the day 
When you went away 
What a life to take 
What a bond to break 
I'll be missing you 
Somebody tell me why 
One glad morning 
When this life is over 
I know 
I'll see your face 
CHORUS (112) x4 
Every night I pray 
Every step I take 
Every move I make 
Every single day 
CHORUS: (Faith) 
Every step I take 
Every move I make 
Every single day 
Every time I pray 
I'll be missing you 
Thinking of the day 
When you went away 
What a life to take 
What a bond to break 
I'll be missing you
