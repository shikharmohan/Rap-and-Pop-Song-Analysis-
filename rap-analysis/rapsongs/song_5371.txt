Where, where you can send the flowers to
The florist for Aaliyah
I'll give you the phone, phone number
In case you need it
Okay Missy take of yourself
I love you
I love you, bye, bye}
I been checkin' on your moms and dad
And your brother, sister, day you left
Passed on and went away with God
But for your momma it's been so damn hard
I hate to even hear her cry
Aaliyah, she asked me
"Why would her baby girl go this way?"
Can you give me better words to say?
One day she'll see you again
With the same old beautiful smile
Long hair and the voice of a hummingbird
You'll be singing them same old songs
Aaliyah, can you hear me?
I hope that you're proud of me
Me and Tim, we been doing our thing
But it's never been the same since you had to go
I ain't never met a friend more incredible
I know you're in real good hands
With God, but damn, I miss you
Aaliyah, if you see Left Eye
Will you tell her me and Boz miss her too?
'Cuz no one's gonna fill her space
TC L not replaced
Y'all the reasons we learned to love
Love fly high wit' your twenty two doves
One day we'll see her again
With the same old beautiful smile
Crazy but sexy, cool
An' she'll be rappin' them same old songs
Lisa, can you hear me?
We hope that you're proud of us
TLC has come long way
But it's never been the same since you had to go
'Cuz the healing process will be long and slow
Aaliyah, I know you're in a safer place
You're face to face with the creator and our maker
And if you and Left Eye happen to chat
Tell her me an' Tionne, we know she much safer
If you see Biggie Smalls, up in the clouds
Tell him, he's still the illest MC we had around
2Pac, there is only one, Big Pun RIP
We say one, yeah, yeah
One day we will see y'all again
With the same old beautiful smiles
All styles, so many styles
And y'all be doing the same old things
The last time we seen ya
We hope y'all can change the world
Let them see how short life be
It would never be the same since you had to go
To the music world y'all are incredible
