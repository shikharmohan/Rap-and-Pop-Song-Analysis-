Yea nigga we'll fly down today. 
G-Uniiiiit! 
[verse1]
I said that my car game crazy 
Smile too much when I see Robin Williams with you baby 
I see in her eyes my smile 
A dinner at the luxury hotel I buy 
Number 1 on Billboard nigga, this is for you 
You have to do 
A race to the infinite in my Porsche Cayenne 
I'm a pimp, wore it, and what didn't want any more 
The Adidas jacket, G-Unit sneakers, shirt of Christian Dior 
New York still singing at 50, still walks the Benz 
LA still travel on my drugs, even food dreams 
The DJ gets control of the club 
I pick up on the streets control, the bitches love the club 
The money moves the world 
My machines still move my hood 
Man, more is not that I'm good, Come on HOLLYWOOD! 
[chorus]
Yea, This is my new success! 
Take this nigger, Ernie Chambers praising me 
How are things 
50 President of the New York sending the game 
My car in the garage continue nigga
Falling desires, you out of the game, get a liquor
[verse2]
An RX-8 but is not in glass 
I'm a G, nigga Yay' still has its shine 
Banks wrote letters so good that I buy 
I'm a hoodboss, I'am not shy 
I start this music in a role draft
Not with lyrics designed, but with gibberish 
Gifts and kisses on the neck of my baby 
A super sonic jet is for sale! You pay me? 
Oprah sings 'Candy Shop' in the shower 
She wears those same clothes 
We sang in the range of ESPN as before 
The option to switch to the HBO 
And is not that we are there, 50 and Y-A-Y-O 
Ferrari, Aston, Lambo, I like the black BMW 
The price of platinum is in sky 
The shine of my Rolex overshadow his shine 
I think that money doesn't go away 
Jaguar XF by burning all the way 
You know, my inbox is full of air 
Smile by smile, I love your hair 
Lexus sedan nigga, 2008 was a year as good 
My page is billing throughout the hood
[chorus]
Yea, This is my new success! 
Take this nigger, Ernie Chambers praising me 
How are things 
50 President of the New York sending the game 
My car in the garage continue nigga 
Falling desires, you out of the game, get a liquor
[talking]
Yeahhh! 
Don't stop bomb 
Clean version on the Westside 
Dirty version on the Southside 
Hahaha 
50 Cent
