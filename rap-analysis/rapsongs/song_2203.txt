What's happenin'?
You need to take it inside
Take what inside?
You're disturbing the peace
Yeah yeah, I done got too big to be hoppin'
Over barbed wire fences, right?
But I had this one broad
She was so damn sprung she use
What? Uhh, and ahh, and a VHS camera
And a VHS camera
I promise you playboy
It was somethin' serious, felt so damn good
Hope I don't go back to slangin' ya-yo
Slangin' llello, to get my mail
See a lot of people don't know
The legendary status of which I come from
Old school like Cab Calloway
Right
Hot damn, I taught him his thang he do
Hope I don't go back to slangin' ya-yo
Slangin' llello, to get my mail
See a lot of people don't know
The legendary status of which I come from
Old school like Cab Calloway
Right
Hot damn, I taught him his thang he do
Been a hustler since birth, mama sellin' dubs in church
Red-handed, caught me stealin' money our her purse
Got branded, permanent whip scars on my back
'Cause I used to get beat, with racing car tracks
But now me got wealth, holdin' a conference call on my
Hands free car telephone lookin' like I'm talkin' to myself
Shootin' the breeze cuttin' it up real smooth like
Choppin' it up like two business men
Talkin' about it, by the way B
What we doin' this week on SoundScan?
If I ain't in Japan, I'm in the Valley
Or maybe next door in Gary Payton bowling alley
Or maybe at the shootin' range, me and Banks
Or on the golf course, with Merton Hanks
Or we lay in the sun, give me my propers
With a beat that's out of this world, lookin' down on doctors
Sippin' on the porch, watchin' my kids play basketball
In the backyard on a 40 by 63 foot long sports court
Hope I don't go back to slangin' ya-yo
Slangin' llello, to get my mail
See a lot of people don't know

Right
Hot damn, I taught him his thang he do
Business spot up in the wilderness, coyotes and wild boars
[Unverified] days like this were made strictly for outdoors
Twenty inch gold super Bravos on my [unverified] everybody ain't poor
To be blessed with success with an independent-ass record label
Check it out, marbles, I got the game from my Uncle Saint Thomas
Used to bank across the street at Wells Fargo
But now it's Merrill Lynch
And just think, I used to sit the bench
I remember gettin' chased by the cops, had to get my stomach pumped
Full of a quarter ounce of rocks, late afternoon
Probably waitin' for me outside of Vallejo Kaiser Permanente
Emergency room with glocks, ready to ride
And hang me to death, somehow I managed to make my escape through
The back of the cafeteria by the vending machine department quickly
Found myself runnin' through the Friendship Apartment Complex
Over there by the railroad tracks, around the corner from the
People's Continuation High School
Somewhere off in the lights, behind Je-nai's Liquor ooh
Hope I don't go back to slangin' ya-yo
Slangin' llello, to get my mail

Get my mail, check it out, dope game ain't goin'
Now it seems the, white-collared crimes, are hookin' up phones
"Charlie Hustle, I got a few homies, I'm doing a compilation
Should I go with [unverified]"
I tell em, "Hell yeah, that's a done deal", drew them off the hinges
[Unverified] them did my cover and my bus benches
Game warrior invested, worldwide sick-wid-it clique, independent chips
Lay that down, lay that down, that's what I'm sayin'
I'm gonna tell you it's cool, 'cause your playa partner
Take his other money right, and then he'll sit up here
And he'll take it then he'll say, "Hold on main"
Let me handle some phone booths
Let me get off into the business, dealers, ballers
Let me get off into the florist business, Beamers, barbershops
Get into commercial lots
Merchants, whatever fertilizes the right way of livin'
You dig what I'm sayin' man? Ay look
Playboy, I look at myself and I say, "Hold on main"
Lemme see what's down, lemme translate it
Lemme translate it into some marbles
Lemme liquidate my revenues
You understand what I'm sayin' 40-Watermelon
Ay, but look here, I'm here to sprinkle my
Godzilla brawler playboy potnas untouchable
Mafia game warriors to adjust to the situations
That goes down in they life, I ain't playin' wit it man
Hope I don't go back to slangin' ya-yo

Hot damn, I taught him his thang he do
There's too many jealous brothers in this game
I can't stand the same, I gotta mine
Hope I don't go back to slangin' ya-yo

Don't wanna go, don't wanna go
Back to the game, hey
