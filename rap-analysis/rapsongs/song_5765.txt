Miss Michelle Tyler
Sweet, beautiful, intelligent, talented, creative
And crazy as hell
And missed more than anything in the world
Thank you for being the best sister
A brother could of ever wanted
Twenty-four years, laughter and joy
Sure is gon' be hard not being able
To see your smile again, baby
So, I guess, I'll just hold onto
All the memories that we did share
Until we meet again
Anyway, I did it, Chell, we did it
I wish you could of been there
For the finishin' touches
But it's all good
'Cause your gonna always
Be in my heart
Oh, thank you for hoopin' on
I'm 'Not That Nigga' for me
You did that, baby
You were already a angel
So I guess your just goin' home
And I know that heavenly choir
Sound good up there, now
They one more strong.
So, you keep singin', baby
And I'm gonna keep you in my heart
And my thoughts
I love you
