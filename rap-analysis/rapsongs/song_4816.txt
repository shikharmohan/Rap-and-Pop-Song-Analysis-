I've been watchin' you from afar
For as long as I can remember
You are all a real man can need
And ever ask for, this is love
This is more than a crush
It was all up at Rutgers, I saw with your man
Smiling, a coach bag in your hand
I was layin' in the coup with my hat turned back
We caught eyes for a moment and that was that
So skated off as you strolled off
Looking at them legs, god damn they looked so soft
I gotta take ya from your man that's my mission
If his love is real he got ta handle competition
You only knew about 5 months
Besides he drinks too much and smokes too many blunts
And I've been workin' out everyday thinkin' 'bout you
Lookin' at my own eyes in the rear view
Catchin' flash backs of our eye contact
Wish I could lay ya on your stomach and caress your back
I would hold ya in my arms and ease your fears
I can't believe it, I had a crush in years
Hey lover
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
I see you at the bus stop waitin' everyday
Your man must think it's safe for you to travel that way
And I don't want ta violate your relationship
So I lay back in the cut with a crush that'a trip
Still he can't stop me from having day dreams
Tonging you down with  vanilla ice cream
Kissing on your thighs in the moonlight
Searching your body with my tounge girl all night
I wonder one day could it be, simple dreams can turn into reality
Our love would come down so naturally
We would walk down the isle of destiny
What your man got his hustle on gotcha type scared
Break ya off a little chump change to do your hair
That seems to be enough to satisfy your needs
But there's a deeper level if you just follow my lead
Hey lover
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Last week I saw ya at the mall
Standing at the pay phone 'bout to make a call
I had a vision, it was me on the other end
Telling you come by and then you walked in
I touched you gently with my hands
We talked about travellin' the distant lands
Escaping all the madness out here in the world
Becomin' my wife no longer my girl
Then you let your dress fall down to the floor
I kissed you softly and you yearned for more
We experienced pleasure unparallel
Into a ocean of love we both fell
Swimming in the timeless, currents of pure bliss
Fantasies interchanging with each kiss
Undying passion unites our souls
Together we swim until the point of no control
But its a fantasy, you won't come true
We never even spoke and your man still love you
So I'm gonna keep all these feelins inside
Keep my dreams alive until the right time
Hey, hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
This is more than a crush
This is more than a crush
This is more than a crush
This is more than a crush
