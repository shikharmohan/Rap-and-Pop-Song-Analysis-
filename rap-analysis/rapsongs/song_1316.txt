I want to get high, so high
I want to get high, so high
I want to get high, so high
I want to get high, so high
Well it's the funk elastic
The blunt I twist it
The slammer five
Buddha fine
Funk on your desk, es'
Oh what you missed this
You got to bear witness
Catch a ho', and another ho'
Merry christmas
Yes I smoke shit
Straight off the roach clip
I roll shit
Fold the blunt
At once
To approach it
Forward motion
Make you sway like the ocean
The herb is more than just a powerful potion
What's the commotion
Yo I'm not joking around, people learnin'
'bout what they're smoking
My oven's on high when I roast the quayo
Tell bill clinton to go and inhale
Exhale
Now you the phunk of the thai'
When I feel the effects
I want to get high, so high
I want to get high, so high
I want to get high, so high
I want to get high, so high
