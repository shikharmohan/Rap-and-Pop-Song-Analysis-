Uhh, uh huh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh huh, come on, check it out, check it out, what?
Brand nubian I'm black and I'm proud
Uh, like that, like that, what? say it loud I'm black and I'm proud
Come on, come on, come on, come on say it loud
We made men in this world, digging for bones
The untraceable ones come with no clones
100 Years from now y'all can still get this bomb
On the brand nubian dot com
My name should be mentioned with the portier, not the gualtier
Although it smell good, I still get mad at rosewood
A nubian card member since that faithful december
In the 80 years, from tears to cheers, things we did should be listed in a
Pyramid, studied by a little kid
Talked about by old jacks with slacks
Can I move the black is my first and foremost
Can I get a little land for me and mine?
Grow vegetables, maybe make a little wine
Build with the gods and the bright sunshine
Before we save others we gotta save our own kind
I'm black and I'm proud say it loud I'm black and I'm proud
Say it loud I'm black and I'm proud say it loud I'm black and
I'm proud
Say it loud
Now did you know it was you who was first to walk the earth
Gave birth to the universe, uh
Afflicted with the curse of the slave
Predicted to inherit the earth in the last days
Now as we take you home, what we make our own
It's written in stone like commandments
Read them every now and then or when you get the chance
Catch a glance through the power lens, see if you could see us advance
G-o-d in the dance, reporting freelance
Fought for a chance, got you hanging by the seat of your pants
Our immediate stance when we came to the game
Was completely advanced so no one sounds the same
7 And one-half ounces of brain
When we around make sure you bow down to the king
Brand nubian style is how we do our thing
So if you feel good, real good
Scream it out loud if you black and you proud
I'm black and I'm proud say it loud I'm black and I'm proud
Say it loud I'm black and I'm proud say it loud I'm black and
I'm proud
Say it loud
Feel me now, check my style
A brother's resume run longer than the nile
Justice cipher born to teach man, woman and child
In the land of the lost where my people went foul
Do the knowledge, black, look at the way that we act
Smoking crack or each other with the gat
The only race of people who kill self like that
I deal with actual facts to keep my mind on track
I love y'all that's why I say these things
Watch me transform chickenheads to queens
Rhymes full of protein like rice and beans
Brand nubian cats here to change all that
The maker, the owner, the cream of the earth
Proud to be black because the black man's first
My flow frequency is at a million megahertz
So when I spit my verbals I'm heard around the universe (yeah, yeah, yeah)
So don't front, say it loud, I'm black and I'm proud
I'm black and I'm proud say it loud I'm black and I'm proud
Say it loud I'm black and I'm proud say it loud I'm black and
I'm proud
Say it loud
