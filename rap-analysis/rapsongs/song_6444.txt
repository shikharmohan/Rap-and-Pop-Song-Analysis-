So Brad, tell me what's going on in your world?
It's fucked up, I'm looking at myself in the mirror
I'm seein' something scary, it's slowly comin' clearer
I had a funny feeling that today will be the day
That someone tries to blow my motherfuckin' ass away
But hey, I'm running out of time to be blunt
I never had the nuts to make the motherfuckin' final cut
I've been depressed for no fuckin' reason
But every problem's got a reason
I'm kinda havin' trouble breathin' somebody help me
Hear my plead, my battle cry, my psychic told me
That it's gonna be hard for Brad to die
She told a lie, I think I oughtta shank the bitch
I got my pistol, thinking if I should shoot the shit
Click, bang, I jammed it, I slammed it aw shit, goddammit
I'm havin' a fucked day to begin with
I lost a bitch, a bird, and then this
My homies tend to think I get too high
I'm doing fine, now pass me the formaldehyde
The only thing that seems to help me cope
Is when I'm drunker than a motherfucker puffin' on the chronic smoke
And then I'm able to deal with the woes
The friends, the foes, the bitches, the hoes
I gotta gang of niggers, but none of them I'd fuck
I gotta gang of bitches, but none of them I'd trust
Trust a bitch, nope, uh, uh, never
I'm havin' too much trouble tryin' to keep my damn self together
They got me by the balls so please, help me
Break these motherfuckin', these motherfuckin' walls
I scream, there's no one there to hear me cry, I guess
It's hard to scream, to motherfuckers when you scream inside
I see my future and it's coming in in plain view
I blame myself, but mommy dear I blame you
'Cause the world was fucked from the first
And havin' me only made the matters worse
Now look at what they did to me
That's some fucked up shit for a kid to see
Motherfuckin' dealin' after dealin', killin'
After killin', I'm tryin' to check a million
The world's going straight to fuckin' satan
A fuckin' shank's about to blow my fuckin' brain
Shit, damn I'm dead, I'm finally through
Hearing all these voices in my head
Somebody finally got me, I'm looking at myself
Outside of my fuckin' body
So now I'm standing face to face
Mr. Scarface versus Mr. Scarface
We were two different people from the start
One nigga's too smart the other too fuckin' hard
We both refused to be outsmarted
Dearly departed, the battle's already started
Fuck it, it's on, I duck, I weave, connect, oh shit
I'm struck, caught me with the piercing lead
And realized to myself I shot my own fuckin' self
Damn, suicide is quicker
I try to break the wall, the wall keeps getting thicker
I really start to miss my mother
I try to climb the wall, it's higher than a motherfucker
I wondering what that sound is
I'm having major trouble tryin' to walk around it
There ain't no getting up I'm trapped
I really should've dropped my motherfuckin' strap
'Cause when I think about it now
I shouldn't have tried to climb the motherfucker
I should've broke the motherfucker down
