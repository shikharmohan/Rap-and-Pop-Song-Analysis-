Ai ya ya yio
Busta Rhymes, ya gotsa be the sure shot
Flipmode, ya gotsa be the sure shot
Aftermath, ya gotsa be the sure shot
My live niggaz y'know, who be the sure shot?
Live bitches y'know, who be the sure shot? Shit
I'm back in ya soul just like a minister
I'm big like a movie, I'm on the screen and at the cinema
While I'm in the process of slowly gettin' rid of ya
I'm back over bitches and then I throw 'em in my videa
Yeah, yeah, the God of the block
Y'know me killa had you spreadin' the spot wet
'Twist It' like Olivia, oh shit, flow so sick in the committee
We know you a slouch duke, we don't even consider ya
Boss nigga, see or hear me in ya area
The more niggaz, the murders
The more the money, the more the merrier
Smash shit 'til everything become mass hysteria
Hungry for street shit, see I be takin' care of ya check nigga
Fuck all the talk, homey I'm daring ya
The lead from the shot'll poision ya blood like malaria
Made back and sell it over exotic
Worm skin interior, my swagger to my bitch
The more money, it's all superior
When we in the spot y'know that we sure to shine
It's all so holy and so divine
Analyze niggaz 'til we can read ya mind
Sometimes a real live nigga is hard to find
We like, drugs overdose niggaz every time
(Cocaina baby, cocaina baby)
(Cocaina baby, cocaina baby)
We like, drugs overdose niggaz every time
(Cocaina baby)
Yo, I'm tired of tellin' ya
Back on my bullshit, fuckin' put a shell in ya
Gangster niggaz respect it, salute me on the regular
When it comes to the street shit, define me as the emperor
Check it, my nigga, most of you muhfuckers amateur
I muster the nigga quick and damage any challenger
But now y'know, oh, a nigga flow so spectacular
Break niggaz down and handle you muhfuckin' characters
Captain of this shit but most of you niggaz is passengers
I'm takin' it back to the hood, like '87 Maximas
Yeah, yeah, y'know who the truth? No need for askin' the
Same question again to get the same answer bruh
Fasten ya seatbelt, bitches fuck wit the bachelor
Wit' money like a thousand coke deals from here to Panama
Strike like a brightness, a light I'm here to dazzle ya
Whole hood from the boroughs to the niggaz up in Attica
Soldiers in the streets, the Middle East way down to Canada
When it comes to the block, y'know I'm the ambassador
Follow nobody's footsteps but said it like a scavenger
Wanna talk money, bitch? Then holla at my manager
The way y'all niggaz is trash, my crew'll get to blasting ya
Twelve shot clip, hollow tips, quick to plaster ya
All over the cement, spread ya like I'm mashing
[Incomprehensible] Bus-a-Bus date but check ya fuckin' calendar
When we in the spot y'know that we sure to shine
It's all so holy and so divine
Analyze niggaz 'til we can read ya mind
Sometimes a real live nigga is hard to find
We like, drugs overdose niggaz every time
(Cocaina baby, cocaina baby)
(Cocaina baby, cocaina baby)
We like drugs overdose niggaz every time
Take me all the way to where you are
I really want to mate, take me now
  (Cocaina baby, cocaina baby)
Take us far away to the sky
I really want to mate, sometime
  (Cocaina baby, cocaina baby)
