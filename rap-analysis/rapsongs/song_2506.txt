Who killed Jane, who killed Jane?
Not the Squad kid, I think we've been framed
Who killed Jane, who killed Jane?
Not the Squad kid, I think we've been framed
Who killed Jane, who killed Jane?
Not the Squad kid, I think we've been framed
Who killed Jane, who killed Jane?
Not the Squad kid, I think we've been framed
Who killed Jane?
Not the Squad yo, we've been framed
The charge
Murder one son for the death of Jane
Murder?
Yeah, homicide kid time to take a ride
Where?
Downtown
For what?
To check your alibi
Must get deep and think quick, bang a set-up
Let met get my coat
Alright move slow when you get up
PT's in my crib, K9's in the front lawn
First thought's to wild, second thought to stay calm
You have the right to remain silent
Cool with the roughness, I ain't violent
Reached for his nine mil, partner started smilin'
Shut up Mulley, turn around and keep your mouth shut
Peep the neighbor's starin' as he reached for his handcuffs
Threw on the bracers, squeeze tight to increase the pain
Thinkin' to myself, damn, who killed Jane?
Who killed Jane, who killed Jane?
Not the Squad kid, I think we've been framed
Who killed Jane, who killed Jane?
Not the Squad kid, I think we've been framed
Who killed Jane, who killed Jane?
Not the Squad kid, I think we've been framed
Who killed Jane, who killed Jane?
Not the Squad kid, I think we've been framed
They got me downtown, starin' at four walls with one call
Been set-up like a roadblock, can't take a bad fall
Sit up straight, state your name and your birthdate
And your whereabouts last night about eight
Slow down?
Slow down?
Something's missing, where's my lawyer?
Cop grilled me and said
"Yo there's your lawyer"
Things'll get rough so don't get tough and try to play games
You're headed up North
For what?
You know homeboy, the death of Jane
You must be insane with no brains sniffin' cocaine
And if I caught a body it'd be yours and not Jane
Oh, Mr. Toughy, you wish you had a nine to bust me
I'm not a child, I don't play, my name ain't Chuckie
Cop got pissed, and stepped back, then grabbed his blackjack
Swung for my dome, ducked and caught my damn back
Ooh
Couldn't feel the pain
Why?
Thinkin' 'bout the payback
Who killed Jane, who killed Jane?
Not the Squad kid, I think we've been framed
Who killed Jane, who killed Jane?
Not the Squad kid, I think we've been framed
Who killed Jane, who killed Jane?
Not the Squad kid, I think we've been framed
Who killed Jane, who killed Jane?
Not the Squad kid, I think we've been framed
Now it's personal so whassup?
Whassup?
Whatyou wanna know?
Who killed Jane?
Okay, I tell you first I gotta go
Where?
Check leakage
Leakage?
Yeah, you know the John
Take him downstairs and watch him make sure you're armed
Cop grabbed me by my neck pushed me towards the damn door
See my homies, locked down on the same floor
So you wanna be a killer and run the streets bro?
Didn't respond, just chilled to play his ego
Stepped in the men's room, still filthy from the ill broom
Hurry up and take a piss and stop stallin' you damn goon
That was the wrong move, how stupid, time to go for mine
Not glacial time, but the black nine
Gotta clear my name, been framed for the death of Jane
Must make my move now or it's ball and chain
Who killed Jane, who killed Jane?
Not the Squad kid, I think we've been framed
Who killed Jane, who killed Jane?
Not the Squad kid, I think we've been framed
Who killed Jane, who killed Jane?
Not the Squad kid, I think we've been framed
Who killed Jane, who killed Jane?
Not the Squad kid, I think we've been framed
With the iron, started firing to let him know I'm serious
Black, don't play hero 'cause all you'se get is a flag and cap
Easy partner, chill put the gun down
Oh, now you tryin' to play me out like Homey the Clown
And you know homey don't play that
Play what?
See, see?
Jim, come back, the mooley shot me
