Can you feel it?
Cause I can.
Oh. oh. oh.
I been on my grind for a while now.
Time to attack now.
Lean in the low in the background.
Can't stop my hustle, it's for life.
Gotta' get that money.
I won't let noone put me in a box, I'm gon' fight my way to top.
Things ain't goin' right - you need a lil' kim in ya' life.
I'm that light when you can't see.
I'm that air when you can't breathe.
I'm that... 
I'm ya' voice when you can't speak.
I'm your, your respirator.
I'm ya' high when you feel low.
I'm ya' strength when you feel weak.
I'm the truth when you don't believe.
I'm the that your heart beats.
I'm ya', your respirator.
If you feel me, go. oh - la - he - ho
If you hear me go. oh - ho - no - ma - ha - lo - eh
People sweated on lil' kim,
But I'm not what they think I am.
Instead of hatin' on what you see - come get to know me.
I'm done with playin' by the same ol' rules.
Ya' over here, makin' major moves.
Sick & tired of the same ol' dudes.
I smell new money.
I know I like to dance sleezy. no, but that don't mean that I'm easy.
First he gotta' know how to please me & I'll be there if he needs me.
But I won't let no man put me in a box; I'm gon' fight my way to the top.
Things ain't goin' right - he need a lil' kim in his life.
I'm that light when you can't see.
I'm that air when you can't breathe.
I'm that... 
I'm ya' voice when you can't speak.
I'm your, your respirator.
I'm ya' high when you feel low.
I'm ya' strength when you feel weak.
I'm the truth when you don't believe.
I'm the that your heart beats.
I'm ya', your respirator.
If you feel me, go. oh - la - he - ho
If you hear me go. oh - ho - no - ma - ha - lo - eh
If you feel me, go. oh - la - he - ho
To all my people across the world, who need the life support
Then I'm ya' . it's a jungle in these streets.
Don't let them get you. cause I been through the same ol' things.
I know it's hard to get out the game. dealin' with' the hurt & pain.
I'm ridin' with' you. I know everyday is a struggle. tryna' get by.
Don't want the trouble. but if you touch a piece of my puzzle,
You gon' get a piece of my muzzle. cause I don't let noone
Put me in a box. I'm gon' fight my way to the top.
Things ain't goin' right. you need a lil' kim in ya' life.
I'm that light when you can't see.
I'm that air when you can't breathe.

I'm ya' high when you feel low.
