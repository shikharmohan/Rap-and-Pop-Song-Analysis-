(It's Delacratic, it's Delacratic)
If I want to I can jump off this building
(It's Delacratic)
I can hold two pieces of doo-doo in my hand
(It's Delacratic)
I can call everybody in that room a rubberneck
  (It's Delacratic)
Come on, please
(It's Delacratic)
I can say anything that I want
(It's Delacratic)
I could wave my hand in my air
(It's Delacratic)
I can stick my hand up my nose
(It's Delacratic)
I can hold my foot and count to three
(It's Delacratic)
I can do anything
Possie, Dovie, Masie
