You know it ain't no stoppin' all tha doggs I'm droppin'
It's Friday night so everythang is poppin'
I got skin lets spin on da hand
So let the games begin
Yakity yak, don't jump back or it's on
Callin' up Earl on the car phone
Mack 10 just got out of court rollin'
Through the hood in his super sport ropin' Too Short
Eighteens got the rear view mirrors vibratin'
And deep dish day tons, you know how we do it
Ain't nuttin' to it but the floss
Overcrowdin' Harrison walks
'Cause if ya fuck wit ours, we leave scars
Out of G ride cars, livin' like stars
Might hit tha highway
On the Vegas run fool 'cause it's Friday
Oh yeah, throw ya neighborhood in the air
If ya don't care
Oh yeah, throw ya neighborhood in the air
If ya don't care
Standin' outside on a Friday livin' on the edge
'Cause we all got 'dem hard heads
It's seems like we all are waitin'
For a drive by playin' tag wit Satan
But we chillin' yeah, we ready and willin'
Ya hear about the latest west side killin'
Forty sippin', set trippin', fo' dippin'
Get the grip in, neva slippin'
BG's tryin' to hang out
But OG said, "Take ya little ass in the house"
My big homey just got out
Used to be down now he's just crack ad
He's bout hard as Darth Vada
In his sweat shirt, khakis and Chuck Taylors
Just see him in the drive way
Gettin' beat like a smoka fool 'cause it's Friday
Oh yeah, throw ya neighborhood in the air
If ya don't care
Oh yeah, throw ya neighborhood in the air
If ya don't care
Why must I be like dat and chase da cat
Or settle for a hood rat
Dukie braids no dreadlocks
Flyin' in and out of jail have a chicken and a cock
And I love her 'cause she down
To fuck around wit the underground pussy hound
And her ass is big round and wide
Jacked up makin' nigga down the ride
Smokin' indo, playin' dat Super Nintendo
Hear a rat, "Tat, tat", on my window
Gave her ass dat pelvic thrust
Don't trust the rubber 'cause its bound the bust
In the oven, in the nappy
I had on two so I was happy
'Cause dat HIV'll make ya dick hang sideways
And dat ain't cool fool 'cause its Friday
Oh yeah, throw ya neighborhood in the air
If ya don't care
Oh yeah, throw ya neighborhood in the air
If ya don't care
Throw the west side in da air
Throw the east side in da air
Throw the south side in da air
Throw the north side in da air
Oh, yeah
