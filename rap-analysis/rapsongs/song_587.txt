Lyrics  Chorus] 
 It's an everday thang when you let your nuts hang 
 My niggas they never change 
 They kickin' it wit the gang and remain the same 
 So follow me now see 
 Up to the double glock in 
 Hear pistols poppin' 
 Buckin' them bodies for shots and 
 
 Thugstas for them all and bodybags thugstas 
 Niggas deal when I man my thugstas got to pump slugs for bustas cause I never 
 did love ya 
 Nigga my niggas will break your neck 
 Nigga trying to disrepect 
 Nothin' but killas and trues I rose wit 
 We'll cut ya so fuck ya 
 East 99 is where you'll find us chillin but nigga what's up 
 Nigga want to get bugged 
 Nigga want to get drugged 
 Nigga really want to get fucked up 
 Pump pump put them in a trunk 
 Now watch them fall down to the pavement 
 
 My nigga just say when 
 And I'm runnin' wit the pump let the gauge bang bang 
 To the bang puff puff but I'm feelin' lovely 
 But I need mo' bud see 
 For me to slang my dummies 
 I got to put em in the mission for money 
 And I better run 
 I'll grab my gat and flip it wit big shot guns 
 When I'm gone gone strung wit me say now say now how we swang them thangs 
 
 It's an everday thang when you let your nuts hang 
 My niggas they never change 
 They kickin' it wit the gang and remain the same 
 So follow me now see 
 Up to the double glock in 
 Hear pistols poppin' 
 Buckin' them bodies for shots and 
 
 Before we go bust a left better hit that liquor store hit em up economy 6 4's

 Little Layzie's runnin wit me thugstas and hustlas 
 Cause niggas we never no bustas 
 Addicted to my niggas to forever in well Flesh be the bigger 
 Brother with nothin' to lose forever we trues and nigga 
 
 Why not test the ripster comin' mo' sinister buckin me pump pump in ya 
 All of my niggas bang bang 
 Kickin in the thang so swang slang and 
 We won't be buckin real low really doe 
 Cause I'm on wit bang brain 
 
 Pap pap stay strapped and again I'm coming to let my lead off 
 Ready to roll and I shook his head off 
 And when I get done I'm going to blow your head off they lost 
 Forever that fifth dog nigga dat all be nailin' 'em all 
 
 Y'all fall down from the ball checkin' out them draws hangin' them balls in 
 Cleveland 
 Watchin' my back when I'm runnin through my city 
 Cause nigga it aint the same 
 Gotta get dank but I smoke and maintain 
 Man we crept and we came doing everyday thangs 
 
 And I won't get caught up brought up 
 Outta the cut wit sawed off sawed up 
 Nigga that brought that pap pap 
 Every time wit gal up yall up started 
 This page but I can't escape my ways 
 
 Holdin the gauge on the raid he slayed rip this slit right back in the days 
 Yes Flesh put 'em to rest 
 Let's test 
 Feelin' the pain runnin this gang insane 
 To the brain runnin' the same stuff it's an everyday thang 
 
 It's an everyday thang when you let your nuts hang [Buckin' them bodies with 
 shots] 
 It's an everyday thang when you let your nuts hang [Buckin' them bodies with
