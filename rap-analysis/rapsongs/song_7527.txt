Technique is ill son, watch how I spill one
Peace to Biggie Tupac Big L and Big Pun
Havoc on the streets of Staten, snitches
House niggaz children watch as they produce the same pattern
Somebody raped our women, murdered our babies
Hit us with the cracks and guns in the early 80's
For those that murdered me shall stand before God
To fall at the hands of fate, then out comes the rod
Bring it back
What the fuck is goin' on? I can't go to sleep
Feds jumpin' out they jeeps, I can't go to sleep
Babies with flies on the cheeks, it's hard to go to sleep
Ish bowled two sixes twice, I couldn't go to sleep
Aiyyo we deep in the stairs, we carry [Incomprehensible] guns
[Incomprehensible] got, hit up with the big shit, bam-bam
Stop at the cheeba spot, then pass the leak spot
So past y'all niggaz again, you took a cheap shot
Not knowin' fuckin' with me, you get your meat chopped
You thought we fell on our face? You need to be stopped
Call on the chariots, call on an ambulance
You better smile my nigga, you on candid cam
Gangsta broad, these be the laws, walk with big balls
Nigga motherfuckin' eunuch, I even take which was yours
I'm the nigga that made you man
When your rap wasn't doin' well, I'm the nigga that gave you a hand
 
Let's love each other
Don't get mad
'Cause it ain't that bad
Just be who you are, you've come so far
It's in your hands, just be a man
Get the jelly out your spine
Cobwebs, out of your mind
I can't go to sleep, I can't shut my eyes
They shot the father of his moms, killed him seven times
They shot Malcolm in the chest front of his little seeds
Jesse watched, as they shot King on the balcony
They spat at Marcus, Garvey 'cause he tried to spark us
With the knowledge of ourselves and our forefathers
Oh Jacqueline you heard the rifle shots cracklin'
Her husband head in her hair, you tried to put it back in
America's watchin', blood stained ink blotches
Medgar took one to the skull for integrating college
What's the science? Somebody? This is trick knowledge
They try to keep us enslaved and still scrape for dollars
Walkin' through Park Hill, drunk as a fuck
Lookin' around like, these devils, I'm ready to break this world down
They got me trapped up in a metal gate, just stressed out with hate
And just, give me no time to relax and use my mind to meditate
What should I do? Grab a blunt or a brew?
 (Don't like the game, nigga use your head)
Grab a two-two and run out there and put this fuckin' violence in you?
  (You should be callin' the shots instead )
I can't go to sleep, I can't shut 'em son I
(The power is in your hands)
(Stop all this cryin, and be a man)
