In no way are we trying to disrespect
Any sort of house or club music
But we're just glad that we're not doing it
And if we were, this is how it would go
(I can't be your lover)
(I can't)
Kicked out the house, you got
Kicked out the house, hip house
Kicked out the house for good
(I can't)
Kicked out the house, you got
Kicked out the house, hip house
Kicked out the house for good
(I can't be your lover)
With your wrinkled pussy
I can't be your lover
With your wrinkled oh, oh, oh
I can't be your lover
With your wrinkled pussy
I can't be your lover
With your wrinkled oh, oh, oh
I can't be your lover
Put it on vibrate
Put it on vibrate
Put it on vibrate
Put it on vibrate
Put it on vibrate
Kicked out the house, you got
Kicked out the house, hip house
Kicked out the house for good
You got, you got
Kicked out of this house
Baby for good
I can't, I can't, I can't be your lover
Put it on vibrate
Put it on vibrate
