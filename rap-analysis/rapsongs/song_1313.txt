Yeah, these voices up in my head
All these voices up in my head
Makin' me dread, when I sleep at night
Visions of people with evil intentions wanna fly my sight
Visions are changin', engagin', and ragin', I'm in a stage and a fight
Listen, the system is pissin' me off
You wanna feel my pipe
Fingers pointed, anointed people, day better up to the knight
Whispers in darkness the hardest, time ain't never gonna feel alright
Feelin' my soul in the hole,
I can't breathe, and I'm frightened for my life
Think I need help or I dwell in Hell
'Cuz I got a grip too tight!
Will you ever get out of my head?
Will you ever get out of my head?
Will you ever get out of my head?
Will you ever get out of my head?
Through every dimension there's tension ahead, I gotta go my way
Dreams are like beans up like comin' through my brain, then I know
I'm baked, for every single minute that's in it, each and every
Brand new day, denial of trial I'm vile, whatever that bullshit they say
I'm sinkin' so low in my self, help me gain, never give no break
Confusion is usin' me sinkin' me up, now the sky's all gray
I'm blazin' and liftin' my mind with kite, let me hit that J
Holdin', controllin' myself over, but the shit won't stay
Will you ever get out of my head?
Will you ever get out of my head?
Will you ever get out of my head?
Will you ever get out of my head?
Will you ever get out of my head?
Will you ever get out of my head?
Will you ever get out of my head?
Will you ever get out of my head?
Will you ever get out of my head?
Will you ever get out of my head?
Will you ever get out of my head?
Will you ever get out of my head?
