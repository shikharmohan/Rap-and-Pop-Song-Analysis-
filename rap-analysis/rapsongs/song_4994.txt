Double the pleasures like double the fun
How many licks does it take to the center of a luda pop
Double the tounges
Who knows, plus I gotta undress em' caress em' bless em'
Steady keep em' guessin'
If that doesn't impress em' then slower move on to the second lesson
Whoo, pantys droppin', body rockin', magnums poppin'

6 hands grippin' the sheets, 30 toes are curled
What in the world is goin' on till the break a break a dawn
Wit man and them girls
'Cause 3 hearts are beatin' fast, but only 2 people screamin'
We comin' together for one 'cause other than hear ourselves breathin'
Get in the game 'n' start workin' it out n diggin' in out
Now lean to the side, throw a dick in your mouf
You gotta get in the groove you got nothin' to lose
So don't move till you figured it out
And keep makin' that face while I'm rubbin' them spots
And we can take turns while the other one watch
And see how she be takin' them shots
And wake up the hood till they callin' them cops, mayne
Hey we gonna be havin' some fun and

Now I'm ready to ride and you can get them tools
And you can start the ignition
I'm grabbin' perms, wigs, weaves, ponytails and extensions
Not to mention its gonna get, hot, Betta come ready to, sweat
I make women cum harder than jacuzzi jets
And I'm willin' to bet that I be keepin' it wet 'cause I feel yah
Little bit of ring on the neck it won't kill yah
Put me on the top or the bottom and I'll drill yah
Given how you wanted to get it to port feel yah
And I'll peel yah, back to back so get ready for the mack attack
They got me takin' in some acrobats
The way they bendin' it from sack to sack
'Cause the mack is back and I'm gone
