Lord, we adore Thee
God of glory
Lord of love
Hearts unfold like flowers before Thee
Hail Thee as the sun above
Melt the clouds of sin and sadness
Drive the dark of doubt away
Giver of immortal gladness
Fill us with the light
Fill us with the light
Oh, fill us with the light of day
Joyful, joyful

God of glory
Lord of love
Hearts unfold like flowers before Thee
Hail Thee as the sun above
Melt the clouds of sin, sin and sadness
Drive the dark of doubt away
Drive it away
Giver of immortal gladness
Fill us
Fill us with the light of day, light of day
Joyful, joyful
Lord we adore Thee
An' in my life
I put none before Thee
'Cuz since I was a youngster
I came to know
That you was the only way to go
So I had to grow an' come to an understandin'
That I'm down with the King so now I'm demandin'
That you tell me who you down with, see
Cuz all I know is that I'm down with G O D
You down with G O D?
(Yeah, you know me)
You down with G O D?
(Yeah, you know me)
You down with G O D?
(Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with G O D?
(Everybody)
Come and join the chorus
The mighty, mighty chorus
Which the morning stars begun
The Father of love is reigning over us
By the way
What have you done for Him lately?
Ooh, ooh, ooh yeah
What have you done for Him lately?
He watches over everything
So we sing
Joyful, joyful
Lord, we adore Thee

Hearts unfold like flowers before Thee

Melt the clouds of sin, sin and sadness
Drive the dark of doubt away, drive it away
Giver of immortal gladness, won't you?
