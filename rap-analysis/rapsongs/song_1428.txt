Get into groove now, something like
Givin' into my own shit, now
Could a drummer have some y'all
Could a drummer have some more
Said a drummer ain't have none
In a long time, c'mon, drummer
Bring that beat back, bring that beat back
Bring that beat back, bring that beat back
Bring that beat back, bring that beat back
Y'all wanna hear that beat, right?
One, two, one, two
Uh, Suttarakankan kankankankan takagi kan
Beat ni noseta kashi kore ichiban
So toshi gin-yu shijin groove
Meguri megutte konomachi de furu
Toyota ni honda nippon mo iroiro
Sony, chiba chiba, sonota moromoro
Dashicha irukedo rap no rokuon
Marena koto daga ima rock on
One
(One)
Two
(Two)
Three, four, five, six, seven
Eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve
Thirteen jikan hikouki ni nokkari koko new york
(Oh yeah)
Bibiri jo, jo, jo
Ani shinco bose
(Oh shit)
Hora mite prince paul, maseo
Pos ni dove mo iru jan yo
Eigo de nandaka itteru yo
(Naanuu)
Rap wo site miro to
Gogo two ji studio
Hai ok
Richigi na boku ra ha mochi on time
Ee member nanka dare hitori kicha ine
Five jikan karuuku keika shite
What's up?
Wassa, wassa to renchu kimashita
Ha to kigatukya studio no naka
Yes, yes y'all, we don't stop
Konna monde minasan ikaga desho
