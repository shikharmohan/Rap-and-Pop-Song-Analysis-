It's not the weather, to wear no sweater..
[Chorus]
Sometimes she changed like the weather
But no one loved me better
I'll never ever forget her
My brand new sweater
Nobody got her wetter
She told me in her letter
I bought her food and fed her
My brand new sweater
[Shock-G}
Baby said, "Ooh baby shoo-be-dooh
Let's hook up again cause the loving is cool"
I said "Yo, I gotta go, I got a show"
She said "I know, after the show let me cook for you
If you're hungry, you never know
You might need help with your laundry
Don't hesitate to call upon me
Before you go, would you meet my mother
She lives right around the corner
It's not a bother, meet my mother!"
I said "Woah, woah, woah, baby slow it down
I said I gotta go, I ain't say I'm leaving town
I got your number, stop tripping
Why're you flipping? Had a great time
Let me get my jacket, I'm dipping."
Hate, hate, hate the way I felt like I dissed her
"Wait, wait, wait" cried the pretty, young sister
She said, "Shock, while I got this chance
I've got let you know that if you rip your pants
I'll beee there, to sew the hole for your butt
Want a nut? Call me up, I'll pick you up in my jetta
No one's got me wetter
Shock, I never got freaked better!"
She said "Here, yo, it's all in my letter"
See, I just met baby last night
We g'd
While I was sleeping she was up
Creeping around writing letters to me
Man, I hate somebody all up in my face when I'm sleep
But I ain't sweating it
"Look, I'll hook-up with you next week"
She said "Wait, let me walk you to the street, baby
Sweet thang, don't forget to ready my letter!"-ac
