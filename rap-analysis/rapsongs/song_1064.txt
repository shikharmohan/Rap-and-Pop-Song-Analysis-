Gotta watch out for them critters
I get the party live, Common Sense will get the party live, huh
I get the party live, Common Sense will get the party live, huh
I get the party live, Common Sense will get the party live, huh
I get the party live, Common Sense will get the party live, huh
I was born in Chicago, raised on Planet Rock
Talking zsa zsa zsa zsa
Catch knock my tape like beats, I'm fresh as fruits
(Uh)
You pussy MC, it's you I rebuke, repent
You burn up, you got me bit, I'm coming as ebit
Got on big hoes at Freak nit, frequently your telling me
Won and worn your rockets
So he ain't put no scratch in my pocket
Yo heard, with my head I cock it
And rock it like that brother in Colors
'Cuz I want y'all to live, my crew is 2 Live, we sneakin' to the rear
But I can't get us all in free, it's just another case of that 2 dollar MC
(What?)
I rock the same clothes 3 days straight to you
They wrinkled but to my they straight
Now I'm straight, are you straight? I'm straight as long as I got beer
I thought about it Jack, and now I'm out of here
Maintain the rock
I get the party live, Common Sense will get the party live, huh
Don't stop the rock
Maintain the rock
I get the party live, Common Sense will get the party live, huh
Don't stop the rock
Maintain the rock
I get the party live, Common Sense will get the party live, huh
Don't stop the rock
Maintain the rock
I get the party live, Common Sense will get the party live, huh
Don't stop the rock
I need me some new socks, I need me some new drawers
I draws attention like a letter to a sargent
Theres a few good MC's the wack, I'm giving code red
Slim say I got nobody but when  they see me at the party
They be like, "Go 'head, go 'head"
'Cuz I got's the cuts like Bobby, rappers are dick heads
Choppin' they demo, I do it like Big Red
My office hours are from 9 to 5
While you avoid the party I make it live
The fellas nod and the chicks dance
While I'm coolin' in my jumpers and my big pants
I'm as dope as PCP, MC's see me and start having flashbacks
I don't flash scratch, I gotta watch my back
Now a days blacks don't know how to act
Besides Larry Fishburn, Charles Jug and Wesly Snipes
Marks wanna test me because I test the mics
I check 'em like sound, and like loose I'm down
Plus I done got better since soul by the pound, I maintain
Maintain the rock
I get the party live, Common Sense will get the party live, huh
Don't stop the rock
Maintain the rock
I get the party live, Common Sense will get the party live, huh
Don't stop the rock
Maintain the rock
I get the party live, Common Sense will get the party live, huh
Don't stop the rock
Maintain the rock
I get the party live, Common Sense will get the party live, huh
Don't stop the rock
I fall fresh apon the spirit, with the lyric that's overwhelming
And house more hoes then Spell man
Worse unwelcome like James Johnston
My brains sponsoring speech on the mic, I'm like a Jackson
Rappers I'm fondling, they try to settle out of court
But I, could never be bought, what type of rebel eats pork?
I'll take the cat and never get caught, you wack together we fought
'Cuz I can't see my melons boxing if he's not boxin' with 'em
I don't care who started it, I'm gonna be apart of it
Regardless of the odds of how hard
It's been many times we was outnumbered and we still got with them
I got rhythm from some boogers and some foxes
But if I becomes a 10 then some brothers all some gin
And I got juice, and this niggas scared
I'll F your head up, like the L.A.
For when I flow for cash I got for broke like Mel for Moore
Why should a male with a B8 get more then me?
When Rashid got an MC degree and a doctrine in rockin' shit
I go to docs to get a fish wish with cheese
I don't mix with MC's 'cuz I just don't like the mother [unverified]
But I'm still maintaining
Maintain the rock
I get the party live, Common Sense will get the party live, huh
Don't stop the rock
