[Verse 1:]
Yeah Rappin Is My Hobby, My House Has A Lobby
My Bitches Act Snobby because I Feed Them Thousands
I Know That Didn't Rhyme but I'm Only Being Honest
Can't Pay Me In Cash now I'm Only Seein Commas.
I Swear got On Saks 5th Boxers Right Now
I'm Tryna Milk The Game As If The Game Was A Cow
I Had An Eddie Bauer Expedition 7 Years Ago
My Grandma Used To Tell Me That She Swear I Been Here Befo.
I Used To Wear Braids Like Jason's Lyric, Woe
Spent A Bundle On The Cross Because I'm Spi-Ri-Tual
I Can Never Pass A Physical I Stay High,
High As The Voice Of Akon!
And Make Mine A Straight wit No Chase
Hold The Ice... I Got Enough On anyway 
And when They See The Boy They Hyperventilate
I Got Them Runnin After Me Like I'm About To Win A Race cause
[Chorus:]
Ima Beast, Ima Dog.
Bitch Ima Beast, Ho Ima Dog
Yea U Know That I'm A Beast, Ima Dog
Ima Beast, Ho Ima Dog. You Know That 
[Verse 2:] 
Never Entertain The Suckas Wit The Hatin Bidness (Nah Never Did That) 
I'm On the Yacht Playin Table Tennis
Expensive Linen, Women Sinning 
Adultery... Compulsively
I'm An Arsonist On The Beat I Blaze Fire
The Door Close To The Booth I Feel Like A Caged Lion (Rawr) 
Yea, Let Me Loose (Rawr) Now Let Me Get em (Rawr) 
Cuz I Ain't Goin Back And Forth Like Badminton
No I Will Never Drop The Ball Like Badminton
And I Aint Bein Conceited I'm Just Ad-Mittin
I Flow Cocky... Got Hand Rhythm
I Got This Bitch On Lock Like San Quentin
I'm Tough Daddy What's Poppin Gangsta (Bloods!) 
[Sirens In The Background]
I'm Tryna Keep My Pockets Fat Like Opera Singers
So Sharp If U Touch Me I'll Chop Off Ya Fingers
I'm On Top Of The Game
Like Helicopter Angles
I See U Niggas I Hope U Havin Fun
I Hope U Have A Gun (Gunshot) Cuz This Shit Is Crazy
Its Little Baby I'm Here To Take It
And Its Lookin Vacant. Cuz...
[Sirens End]
[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3:] 
Ok... Now Ima Go Off On'em
At First I Was Goin Soft On'em
But Now Its Time To Go Hard!
Bustin... Bangin Bo guard [?]
Take A Shit In Yo Yard
Take A Piss On Yo Broad
Make A List Of Yo Boys 
And Go And Murder Them All(Haha)
Life Is A Short yea a Midget Told Me That
And I Always Thought I Was Fly Like I Had A Pigeon On My Back
But I Got Decisions On My Back
A Vision On My Back
And Don't Try To Run Up On Me I Got Precision Wit That Gat
I Don't Rat-Ta-Tat-Tat-Tat
All I Got To Do Is Tat!
Bet I Hit My Tar-Get
Like A F**kin Dart Mat
My Address Is Cloud Nine

Weezy On His Grind
I'm bout My Frankenstein
Yea U Know Me, From My Lincolns To My Franklins
See I Make That Money Stretch And Connect Like An Anklet
These Bitches Runnin In Out My House Like A Banquet
And I Don't Even Speak Their Language... Ahahah
And If The Bitch Boyfriend Get Angry
Then My Niggas Turn Around And Tell His Whole Clique

[Chorus x2: To The End]
