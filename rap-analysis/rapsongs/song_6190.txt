We be kickin' yo' fat funky ass, on WKYA
What I'ma do now, huh? What I'ma do now, huh, huh?
What I'ma do now? It's all fucked up now
Yo, excuse me muh'fucka, I'm tryin' to get through
When Doc loaded, I'm like a stud missile
A stud six-two, I'm huntin' down hoes
With no drawers on and buttoned down clothes
Don't brown nose just join it
Ecstasy pills, with Buddha Man signs stamped on it
Jam on it, the 'Blair Witch' wouldn't camp on it
I block and shine like suntan ointment
You do a dance when I layer this clip in
Only dude with a bike with air conditionin'
Fuck the Feds your door, Red'll kicked in
So prepare to wear scuba gear equipment
I wet it, my tape underground leakage
It hit the air and you'll swear you found Jesus
The man who turned out the Summer Jam
Not with a mic, I brrr, tuck it in
The noise keep the helicopter hoverin'
Your boys is dead weight when I muscle in
I need a hot girl, a ryde or die chick
Mainly a hot chick ridin' Funk Doc dick
Smell it, when the odor airs in
The gorilla shit, hoes in polar bear skin
The chronic stink up the overhead bin
When I, yo, Redman struck again
What I'ma do now, huh? What I'ma do now, huh, huh?
What I'ma do now? It's all fucked up now
(Can y'all hear me out there? Puffy)
What I'ma do now, huh? What I'ma do now, huh, huh?
What I'ma do now? It's all fucked up now
(Can y'all hear me out there? Puffy)
Nigga, we go, oops, upside your head
Simon says, "Leave you hogtied instead"
On the floor with ya shirt like I dyed it red
Wild, wild bricks, eighty foot spider legs
Doc in, double, oh, learned to drive it
I'm, on the roof, guns under the armpit
Yellin' out, yo sawed off, hand on the pump
And I'll pump a cannon first man that jump
I got a punch that'll cut your beard up
Doc is like warm when you touch my earmuffs
I wild out, throw blows
Somethin' about Mary, rode me in a Ford Explorer
The pressure at time five remind me
That y'all can't eat like it's Ramadan week
My mascot was built for kamikaze
If it fails, L.O.D. right behind me
What I'ma do now, huh? What I'ma do now, huh, huh?
What I'ma do now? It's all fucked up now
(Can y'all hear me out there? Puffy)
What I'ma do now, huh? What I'ma do now, huh, huh?
What I'ma do now? It's all fucked up now
(Can y'all hear me out there? Puffy)
What I'ma do now, huh? What I'ma do now, huh, huh?
What I'ma do now? It's all fucked up now
(Can y'all hear me out there? Puffy)
What I'ma do now, huh? What I'ma do now, huh, huh?
What I'ma do now? It's all fucked up now
(Can y'all hear me out there? Puffy)
Can y'all hear me out there? Huh? Puffy
Can y'all hear me out there? Puffy
Can y'all hear me out there? Puffy
Can y'all hear me out there? Puffy
I need some weed muh'fucka
We need to smoke muh'fucka
We need weed muh'fucka
We need to smoke muh'fucka
Light it, roll it, light it up
Say light it, roll it, light it up
Say roll it, light it, light it up
Say roll it, light it, smoke it up
Say roll it, light it, smoke it up
Say roll that, light it, smoke it up
Say roll it, light it, smoke it up
Say roll it, light it, smoke it up
Say roll it, light it, smoke it up
