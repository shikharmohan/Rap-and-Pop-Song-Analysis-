The way we style have a nigga tryin' to blast som'in
I guess the way we politicin' probably got the niggaz
I know they layin' like Dunn, we got ta stick them niggaz
In due time, they probably see the apple sour
And once, we takin' over, they'll realize the world is ours
The faggot niggaz don't deserve bein' cream
A bunch of snitches on the same team, tryin' to reign supreme
