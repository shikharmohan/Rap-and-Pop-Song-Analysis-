Every time I drops yakkin', I'ma do no wrong

You hata niggas, I know your forte
We blind your little shine, fuck what you portray
While you wanna leave I know your lil' chick wanna stay
And if you violate see I make sure you'll all gon' pay

Look, I know at times it probably seem like the hardest
When you ain't got it, but you gotta go and get it regardless
Check it, get on your hustle homie
