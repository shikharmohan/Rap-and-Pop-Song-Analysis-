Weezy bad, no really im good
sound like a t-rex live under my hood
better know the Tek live under my seat
put you in the ground, now you live under my feet
all white diamonds on the front of my teeth
and you better put the O in front of my G
the bullshit they talking doesn't come to my knee
im like a linebacker, don't run it by me
my two best friends will accompany me
and right now they are in my dungarees sleep
one name mack, one name nina
they hit you, make you do the macarena

chest head face, arm leg stomach
i never been afraid, i aint scared of nothing
cause i got my thang, my thang, my thang
and that bitch go boom [x6]

they like the ball, they call me hot sauce
they know i keep that toaster, you could be my pop toart
i never had height but boy i got heart
and i aint gotta speak, i just let my car talk
i got more clips then any movie you saw, i pull up on you like i need some grey poupon 
hard hat no, but i got that tool on
and you should be my paper, if ever the tools drawn yeah

i don't rap, i just shit like a newborn
i don't write, i just spit like a tooth gone
so tell them haters cut it out, like a coupon
how come that chopper sound like a newborn
little nigga gotta hold that bitch with two arms
i got the heat, the fire and the lukeworm
im on your heels like a shoehorn
tek's, ak's, i leave the scene ugly
chest head face, arm leg stomach
i never been afraid, i aint scared of nothing
cause i got my thang, my thang, my thang
and that bitch go boom [x6]
you hear them guns like boom [x6]
