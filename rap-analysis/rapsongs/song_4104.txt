So she come and talk to me like Casey, JoJo, and Devante
I say hi my name is Weezy and I know you know Omarion
Haha, I get it in like parking spots
And they say money talk, so donÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½t ask me why I talk a lot
Girl IÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ll kiss your softest spot, IÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ll buy your apartment out
Actually I just bought a house, I get it in and walk ÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½em out
I done got the dreads braided up, hair long long
And IÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½m with a redbone, that donÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½t want leave her thong on
ItÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½s too big, itÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½s too wide, it wont fit
But I get it in
