Get 'em up high, okay, yeah
Go all-star, and get down for yours
To the ladies in the house, be proud of yours
You got the, Roots crew with the sound of course
High, lift 'em up high, okay
When that adrenaline get in they system
It get 'em out on a quest for stardom
Could be a motherfuckin' problem in Philly
Cincinatti, Los Angeles or Harlem
Kids call theyself killers let they hammers do the talkin'
Don't even know the meaning of life, ain't seen a thing
And you dream of floodin' the scenery with, llello and greenery
But for now, you stickin' her with the heavy machinery
Wonder how, you lift it up, be only 17
And like e'rybody he wanna shine, young brothers on the grind
Holdin' somethin' in they spine, "Bowling for Columbine"
Stressin' to me how it's all about a dollar sign
Dig the way you out of line, out of sight and out of mind
Up against the clock and damn near out of time
"The Tipping Point" has arrived, and that's the bottom line
To all my peoples that's stars, it's our time to shine
Let's get 'em up high, c'mon
Go all-star, and get down for yours
To the ladies in the house, be proud of yours
You got the, Roots crew with the sound of course
High, lift 'em up high, okay
Go all-star, and get down for yours
To the ladies in the house, be proud of yours
You got the, Roots crew with the sound of course
High, lift 'em up high, okay
Yo, ain't it strange how the newspapers play with the language?
I'm deprogrammin' y'all with uncut slang shit
I know some peoples in the party armed and dangerous
Twist some cool champagne, I'm goin' through changes
A grown-ass man, I done paid my dues
Learn the rules lil' homey, you could be one too
Niggaz know, ain't no tellin' what he gon' do
But recognize young bruh, I'ma do it for you
You know why? We all stars and we highly evolved
Hip-Hop, it's not pop like Kylie Minogue
If it bang, them gettin' busy brothers probably involved
In the game, where everybody got a shottie to draw
I guess you probably a thug, you boss ballin' or what?
I can't call it man, I got the ladies fallin' in love
'Cause handsome, intelligent, tough, I'm all the above
I know you knew it it's the movement, groove to it while you doin' it up
Go all-star, and get down for yours
To the ladies in the house, be proud of yours
You got the, Roots crew with the sound of course
High, get 'em up high, c'mon
Go all-star, and get down for yours
To the ladies in the house, be proud of yours
You got the, Roots crew with the sound of course
High, get 'em up high, c'mon
Introducin' the band you gotta see to believe
He got the mic in his hand, so keep the heat up your sleeve
It's Black Thought, he rockin' sharp so the speakers'll bleed
I run a triathalon, you wouldn't see me fatigued
I'm a star, and maybe y'all should cop somethin' to be
Or trade some of y'all equipment in for somethin' you need
'Cause it's a, lot of bullshit floodin' the scene
Where everybody's a star, and hot shit is few and far between
We lose the grip of what, garbage mean
Shorties wanna be theyself, I know it's hard to be
Don't wanna do the Ruben Studdard and come off less threatenin'
Keepin' it real'll kill you if you end up lettin' it
Ain't it blowin' your mind how the game all in line
Now the best, to the rest, we fin' to end up settin' it
I'd tell you that I was a veteran but it's evident
You act like you want it, you gon' end up gettin' it
Go all-star, and get down for yours
To the ladies in the house, be proud of yours
You got the, Roots crew with the sound of course
High, lift 'em up high, c'mon
Go all-star, and get down for yours
To the ladies in the house, be proud of yours
You got the, Roots crew with the sound of course
High, get 'em up high, okay
Go all-star, and get down for yours
Young ladies in the house, be proud of yours
You got the, Roots crew with the sound of course
High, uh-huh high, c'mon
Everybody is a star, everybody is a star
Everybody wants to shine, till the sun [Incomprehensible]
Everybody is a star, everybody is a star
I love you for who you are, every bit of you's a falling star
Everybody is a star, everybody is a star
Everybody wants to shine
