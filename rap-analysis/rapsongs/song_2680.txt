The following previews have been approved for all audiences
By the 'Committee For Audiovisual Sound'
On the mean streets of New York, everyone has a crew
Now the music industry has one of their very own
Violator Entertainment present
The most thrilling trio since Three, the Hard Way
Yogi, Chaddeo and the Mighty Hah
The Cru
Uhh, uhh, can you feel it? Uhh
Now once upon a time, let's see if I remember
Back in January
(Nah, chill, it was December)
Also coming in the summer of '96
We saw Nas Escobar captivate an entire industry
Little did we know when he stepped through the door
The Firm he represented would be right behind him
The kid got his own Firm, tch
De canta mari con Cormega Mamaow
From the most lethal conglomerate on wax
Foxy Brown, AZ, Nas Escobar and now introducing
Cormega the Executive
This how it went down
Add to undergrowth therapy, now surgery
A n*** wetted me but he didn't murder me Dunn
I survived, he thought that I died
Now it's time to throw the nine clip in, mission revenge
Once was friends but that s*** dead
That stupid motherf*** shoulda shot me in the head
And now for our feature presentation
TrackMaster Entertainment
In conjunction with Violator Entertainment
Bring to you, 'Foxy Brown The Album'
What the hell do you think I'm running here, a chicken coop?
Foxy, the word's on the streets from New York to Cali
You're the one but you gotta be careful
There's a lot of haters in the game
This b*** rose thirty seven thousand five hundred dollars
Working part time
Ya know something, Foxy? You're headed for the top, top
Straight ahead and when you get there, you gotta stir it all up
You see, you're gonna make so much money
When you walk down the street
They're gonna think your pockets got the mumps
Can you dig it, dig it, dig it?
