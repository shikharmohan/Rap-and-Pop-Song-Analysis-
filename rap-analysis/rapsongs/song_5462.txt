'Cause I got my prize right here
But see there's guys at the party
Ain't nothin' out there for me
Ain't nothin' out there for me
This is where I wanna be
I donno I've already been in the streets
And I ain't come across nothin' so sweet
He's the only man that I love
And I don't need more than one
So don't worry when I'm hangin' out
He's the only one that I'm thinkin' about
I know he's insecure everytime I leave out the door

So don't worry when I'm hangin' out
He's the only one that I'm thinkin' about
You can love him he's my baby for sure
I assure him I love him more than ever before
And he don't owe me love like a dumb happy man
I adore him and no one had me out there like that
Nigga love him he's my baby for sure
I assure him I love him more than ever before
And he don't owe me love like a dumb happy man
I adore him and no man has come closer than him
Ain't nothin' out there for me
This is where I wanna be

And I ain't come across nothin' so sweet
He's the only man that I love
