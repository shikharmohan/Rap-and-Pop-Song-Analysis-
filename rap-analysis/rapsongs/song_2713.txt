Still going

Verse 1:
[willie d]
You ain't followin' the leader
Less you follow with me
It's willie d, motherfucker
Eternally to say,
That I'm a loud-mouth nigga with an attitude
Intimidation, fuckin' with a man
Never seen a badder dude
I'm rather lude
My condom sucked
But I don't give a fuck
Now nigga, nigga what
Opposition so frightend that they vrim a shadow
Hot sluts in the muggship creep without a paddle
I'm ready willin', and able to pull a bullet in your navel
If you got beef bring it to the table
I'm unstabile, look in my eyes
It's showin' death
Fuck right, I go on livin'
Wanna see a mil, before I'm killed
Get a house on the hills if it's god's will
Why niggas gotta cry an o.g
Better motherfuckers die before me
Bye, bye
There's a better place for gangbangers
I take you there
I like the motherfuckin' stablesingers
My itchy finger says fuck it and I squeeze the trigger
Watchin' I be the one to splat this ho-ass nigga
I ain't feelin'

Verse 4:
[caine of menace clan]
The sun rises in the east
And sets in the west
But I'm down with that south,
With an s on my chest
It's that loced down key cocaine
To bring the pain
>from that menace to society
Better known as caine
It's that motherfuckin' thug shit
I'm bustin' slugs shit
Young and schoolboy
I'm becomin' a drug dealer
In the streets of that west
I wouldn't settle for less
Until I got my hands on that smiff and that wes
Niggas try to swollow me
It's all about survival, g
Fuck these bitch niggas
It's off some trouble, g
I blow 'em in the wind
And then I sell again
I pack a 9 milli
Cause that's my best friend
Niggas, I done told ya
Blow 'em up like dohja
Your momma couldn't keep ya
So I ain't tryin' to hold ya
I'm a motherfuckin' menace
Give me a life sentence
Picture it ain't over
Untill the nigga finish
With that motherfuckin' thug shit
Bustin' slugs shit
I'm straight from the west
Home of that crip and blood shit
Where niggas die at day
Niggas die at night
Niggas die whenever
It seems the time is right
These soldiers play for keeps
