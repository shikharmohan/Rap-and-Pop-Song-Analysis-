Radio killer
Yeh
Y'all think they can handle this one man?
Alright
Call the radio and tell 'em this your song
This your song, this your song, this your song, this your song
Girl come on, girl come on, girl come on
Cuz I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby
Met this little girl, she was off the hook
I got cold chills when her body shook
Hot sex on the platter, no need to cook
I let her steal my heart like a horny crook
Had her grinding and winding against my leg
She fuckin' with my head, want a nigga to beg
Sexy pumps on, toenails red
Your body's a gun baby, pump me full of lead
It hard to hold you when you movin' vulgar
Peace sign on your eyes like John Travolta
My pulp ain't fiction, it's an addiction
To see your booty clap on the floor in the kitchen
Nasty girl, taught me all the lingo
While mama play bingo, she ride Mandingo
She don't give a damn if I'm married or single
She makes me tingle
Shawty I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, yeah
She likes Hip-Hop and R&B;
Her life time goal is to be on TV
She looking for a man that could give her a break
Like Usher or Justin Timberlake
I'm really not sure if her breasts are fake
Cuz wit whipped cream on em, they taste just like cake
We drink some beer, inside of daddy's '64
She shot me in the back with Cupid's arrow
We finished the 6-pac, she pushed the seat back
Pulled up her dress n she let me eat that
I'm drunk as a skunk, feeling all dirty
Truck stop bathroom at 7:30
Bought her some dessert, mother fuck it's its early
Head spinnin' around like roller derby
Everything about her says you don't deserve me
I hope I'm worthy
Cuz shawty I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, yeah
(Cuz I'm your baby)
You need somethin' like me?
(Good luck)
Cuz he ain't nothin' like me
(No)
You can search but you never gone find
A love that's quite like mine
(No)
Need a man that can love you good
And treat you like he should
With me shawty you the shit
He might be good but he ain't like this
Cuz I'm your baby
In the back of the pickup, clothes are ripped up
She see my chrome wheels, it gets more real
Running and laughing, music blasting
Side of the road, bent over crashing
Mouth all dry, been puffin herb
If you see my mama, don't say a word
The cops wanna know why my words are slurred
Don't ask me officer, ask her
Want another drink baby? She like, 'Sure'
Wanna hit the club? She like, 'I don't curr'
She all in the rearview doin' her hurr
Hairspray and lip gloss everywhurr
This all happens on an average day
Your life is the shit girl, I'm here to stay
Never had a girl make me feel this way
Even though I had to pay
Shawty I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, yeah
