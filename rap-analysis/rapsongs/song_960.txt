With your similar features like Olivia Newton-John
Damn, ohh, I make the whole place warm, then
Hit you with some shit that make you niggaz look deformed
Now, stay tuned to every Busta Rhymes, coming soon

Whoah, what seems to be the whole analysis?

When I step in the place you should keep your mouth closed
Take your fat finger out your nose
You should just pay attention, and watch how I wild on records
Make you sing, "The Lord is my shepherd"
In the process I do away with all nonsense
Hit you with magic like my name was Pocahontas
The dread, gon' make you party 'til you dead
Niggaz quick to talk shit oops! Upside your head
Put your head to bed let me do my thing Nuff said
Shit so hot make your chicken head do the spread
Tell me what you said, I said I never leave you misled
While you bullshit, I'd rather get the Lucci instead
Hah-huh-hah-hee-hah! Flip until you fall
Whylin' in your whip, 'til you crash into a brick wall
Through the nine-six, I be that nigga that be priceless
Always blowin' up your spot, bringin' more surprises
You, you know you really need to come clean
Let me do my thing, don't you even try to intervene
I will endanger your species like an ostrich
Hold you hostage, and crazy feed you swine sausage
Hah! I be the number one chosen just to keep you open
Chill with your thoughts I got your brain frozen
Pay the prices made the needed sacrifices
To present the grand opening of Flipmode Enterprises
Watch me get down and just do my thing baby
