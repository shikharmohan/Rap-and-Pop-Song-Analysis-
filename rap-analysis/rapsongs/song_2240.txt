[ E-40 ]
This bourbon and Carlos Rossi
Got me feelin like the man of steel
Extreme hyphy energy drink
Spinning steering wheel
Mardi gras beads around my neck
Invisible sets, pull-outs
Diamonds in my mouth
Rally stripes, muscle cars
Vans and campers
My dude got handlebars
Get out yo cameras
Put the tarp down, break out the crates
We on the soil ice skatin
Doin figure 8's
The king of slang
They call me Ebonice
Bout to get stupid and dumd
Like jasox and mantronics
(Dumb dumb dumb dumb)
Hear me out
The first muthafucka to even speak about a drought
40 a fool i heard he growin out his hair
Swear? yea he takin it there
Uuuhhh
It's party music
Get used to it
The hyphy movement
[ Chorus }
Tell me when to go
Tell me when to go
Tell me when to go
Tell me when to gooo
Dumb, dumb, dumb da da dumb
Dumb, dumb, dumb da da dumb
Tell me when to go
Tell me when to go
Tell me when to go
Tell me when to gooo
Dumb, dumb, dumb da da dumb
Dumb, dumb, dumb da da dumb

(The Game)
Yo I get hyphy
In Bays, All-Stars
Addidas, Hurricanes, Timberlands and Nikes
I'm so Hyphy
Snatch up wifeys
Got half the niggas in the NBA tryin to fight me
I put down the ball
picked up the tech
I'm nice around mikes like Ron Artest
Play better for the west 
40 Water I'm on one
Jesus had dreads so fuck it I'ma
Then I'ma shake my shit 
after that have a bitch braid my shit
Chop it off and fade my shit
If L.A. is back that mean the Bay is back
Then the top on the CLK is back
I get dumb,dumb
Wit da windows tinted
Cops pull da Benz over
And ain't nobody in it 
Ghost ride the whip
Ghost ride yo shit
And when i get writer's blok I ghostride ya bitch
It go front, back then i pull in out
Now gas break da car peelin now
First Master P, then Pac, then I came for the Bay
Don't do it for me nigga do it for Mac Dre
[ Chorus }
Tell me when to go
Tell me when to go
Tell me when to go
Tell me when to gooo
Dumb, dumb, dumb da da dumb
Dumb, dumb, dumb da da dumb
Tell me when to go
Tell me when to go

Tell me when to gooo
Dumb, dumb, dumb da da dumb
Dumb, dumb, dumb da da dumb
