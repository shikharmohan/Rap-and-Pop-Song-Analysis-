I got a drop on thirty, rims so purty
Shut ya lil' Gallardo down, close curtain
Ya got a Murcielago, I got a McLaren for it
Balla of the year, I oughta win a award
I got money offshore that I made off tour
Cash stashed in a paper bag from a whore
Some from the dro, some all blow
Never go broke but I still want more
Ya ain't gettin' nothing pimpin if ya ain't gettin' dough
Ya got a bitch and ya wonder why she ain't gettin' low
But she freakin' with four, shit, if you was tryin' to be fly

Who ya ever seen under thirty this fly?
Playa house, South Beach, top floor, it's just a tie
And this'll never stop, I'll do this shit 'til I die
Then after that consider me a ribbon in the sky
I'm G4 flyin', big boat buyin'
Land in Miami, then I sail to a island
My Cali crew high in the hills, I ain't lyin'
Man, them bitches get high in anything they tryin'
I got cars I don't know about, money I don't know about
Three or four movies, get a hundred K a show about
Ten mil in real estate make them niggas really hate
What I care about it? I ain't like them niggas anyway
Ain't no use in tryin' to lie
You know we be ridin' fly

Boy, you know we be twice as fly
We do this

I'm a fool with the bitches, I talk they listen
Funny thing, all I gotta say is lets get it
And my mouth piece sweet but my dick game vicious
Plus I'm paid but they already rich, they ain't trippin'
She can tell I'm fly first time, she ride with me
S65 who ride the 550
King worldwide, God of my city
Yeah, them other niggas say that they hard but not really
Coupe super clean, shut all the cars down
I got 50 G's on me, I'll tear the mall down
Used to be in the [Incomprehensible], I'm in the summer home now
One in Cabo, one in Miami, think I'll go to Rome now
Ain't no use in tryin' to lie
