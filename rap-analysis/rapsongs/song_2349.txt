Uh, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
We're renegades, yeah yeah yeah yeah
We're renegades, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hit me up man
**** I'm from the ***** yo' hood ain't no realer
You the **** livin' next to the killer
I'm the killer that moved out of the block
And head back to the hood, when I'm movin' my ****
You can find me on a dark road, dark clothes
****, in the console and God knows I make grip off ****
****, I could get rich off blows
My nation affiliation pitch forks I've chose
What the **** you gon' do? We bang back ****
I'm a six point star in a gray bandanna
I'd die for this, **** you rhyme for this
**** I ride for this and did time for this
That's why I'm convinced you fear, that I'm convicted
Until elevens in soaps, and some gangsta **** man
Guess who gorillas leave tats in fragments
Two **** through your cabbage, and gas from Ca$h
**** always talkin' that ****
What you flaggin', who you **** with? I don't give a ****
You can live in the hood and ****
But remember who you **** with, I don't give a ****
**** talkin' all that ****
What you flaggin', who you **** with? I don't give a ****
You can live in the hood and ****
But remember who you **** with, I don't give a *****
Tip our levels and scarce piece, a meal beast
We'll creep one deep, slump seat, dump ****
**** scream "**** me, he lucky, when I **** it
I left respect enough for an open casket
Way to go Ca$his, boost up my ego
Let loose, out sunroof with my Eagle
Folk of the century, rollin' with peoples
The omen, the sequel, the more they will see you
Close kin, **** close to no skin
His momma pretends that she doesn't know him
I'm the reason for the whole 'Say No' slogan
**** in folk and locoed if provoking
Got a brand new **** with the **** in
Leave your family with the wake for hostin'
I'll collect enough **** 'til my hands the Aspens
I'm the realest **** 'round here, ask for Ca$his folk
**** always talkin' that ****
What you flaggin', who you **** with? I don't give a ****
You can live in the hood and ****
But remember who you **** with, I don't give a ****
**** talkin' all that ****
What you flaggin', who you **** with? I don't give a ****
You can live in the hood and ****
But remember who you **** with, I don't give a ****
Loadin' the cup folk, loadin' it up tote
Hang fire up I, choke from the **** smoke
That's on the boss man, my **** Ross came
Place **** into a coffin
This is renegades, Rick not really paid
Gave Ca$h pistols, now they milli ****
Full **** of **** that's really weight
While my workers foldin', now that's really cake
Give it right back to 'em, watch it regenerate
I'm a degenerate black bandit, livin' ape
**** dig in they pockets like DJ's dig in crates
If you cuttin' my profits, you gon' in to dish some cake
**** and ****
I'm the independent kingpin, **** Koch
****, plus sold O-Z
**** never son me, I was born O.G. fo'
**** always talkin' that ****
What you flaggin', who you **** with? I don't give a ****
You can live in the hood and ****
But remember who you **** with, I don't give a ****
**** talkin' all that ****
What you flaggin', who you **** with? I don't give a ****
You can live in the hood and ****
But remember who you **** with, I don't give a ****
Aiyyo Alchemist
Let's play 'em some of that new Stat Quo **** man
