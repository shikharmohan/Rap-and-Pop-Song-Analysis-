(E-40 and son talking)
(E-40)
Why was I born in these trifling ass times?
Why is it mandatory that I carry nines?
Don't be to civil 'cause even white folks get jacked to
Doctors, high class lawyers and even Japs too
You ask me why I speak the real the way I feel
How come we call bitches hoes and you call us negros?
They want to do me like they did Stacks
What is this young black man doing with all that scratch? huh
I see some timahs on the yayo track readin they mail
Talking bout "I got white girl for sale"
But they ain't talking to me 'cause I'm an oldie and they knows that
I used to be just like them I tell them "y'all get that scratch"
Magazine was never nothing like Bel Air
High speed shot outs and shit, but I loved it there
	40 where you've been playa, it's been a while?
Marinatin' accumulating paper pal
Y'all kind of doin it huh, you still grindin?
Hell yeah, you know them tapes you keep rewinding
Money ain't changed me, money changed the way people think about me
When I was broke all I had was my family
You know what kills me doe them fuckin' numskulls
I hate when blacks be clowin blacks on all these talk shows
It's bad enough we shootin up each other tradgically
Two days ago they found some brother smothered badly
Nobody's to be trusted in this day and age
To much jealousy and envy on the wrong page
And fuck the po po because that 39% tax I pay
Don't get me nathan but a choke hold and some pepper spray
Chorus
Our father who art in heaven 
hollow it be thy name thy kingdom come
That's the prayer that I say so spread the word 
And if you feeling down and out read proverbs
You know that I've been tweakin off something strange
Startin to see a lot of womens at the shootin range
Domestic violence but here's an old ghetto myth
My potnas auntie scold her boyfriend with some hot grits
I'm from the G-E double T-T to the oh no
Where only few dare to go
   (e-40 Jr.)
I spits game like a soldier 
tonk since I told you this 
Rap kingpin giant, six year old vocalist
You don't want to see me 
Do it like I do that
All up in your tall-can face I tell you get more scrilascratch
Y'alll need to get up on it
The game is way to deep
I'm not your average hustler 
I be creepin while you sleep
Game, Straight game
Get up on it , Straight game
Chorus-  
It's all Bad
