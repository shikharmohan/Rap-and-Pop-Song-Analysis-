I've been workin' this graveshift
And I ain't made shit
I wish I could
Buy me a spaceship and fly, past the sky
I've been workin' this graveshift
And I ain't made shit
I wish I could
Buy me a spaceship and fly, past the sky
Man, man, man, if my manager insults me again
I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up
Then I'm gonna shorten the register up
Let's go back, back to the gap
Look at my check, wasn't no scratch
So if I stole, wasn't my fault
Yeah I stole, never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Askin' me about some khakis
But let some black people walk in
I bet they show off their token blackie
Oh now they love Kanye
Let's put him all in the front of the store
Saw him on break next to the 'No Smoking' sign
With a blunt and a marl
Takin' my hits, writin' my hits
Writin' my rhymes, playin' my mind
This fuckin' job can't help him
So I quit, y'all welcome
Y'all don't know my struggle
Y'all can't match my hustle
You can't catch my hustle
You can't fathom my love dude
Lock yourself in a room
Doin' five beats a day for three summers
That's a different world like cree summers
I deserve to do these numbers
The kid that made that
Deserves that Maybach
So many records in my basement
I'm just waitin' on my spaceship
I've been workin' this graveshift
And I ain't made shit
I wish I could
Buy me a spaceship and fly, past the sky
I've been workin' this graveshift
And I ain't made shit
I wish I could
Buy me a spaceship and fly, past the sky
Man, I'm talkin' way past the sky let's go, yeah
And I didn't even try to work a job
Represent the mob at the same time
Thirsty on the grind chi state of mind
Lost my momma, lost my mind
Life, my love that's not mine
Why you ain't signed? Wasn't my time
Leave me alone, work for y'all
Half of it's yours, half of it's mine
Only one to ball, never one to fall
Gotta get mine, gotta take mine
Got a tech nine, reach my prime
Gotta make these haters respect mine
In the mall till twelve
When my schedule wore headset nine
Puttin' those pants on shelves
Waitin' paitently I ask myself
Where I wanna go? Where I wanna be
Life is much more than runnin' in the streets
Holla at 'ye, hit me with the beat
Put me on my feet, sound so sweet
Yes I'm the same old G, same goatee stayin' low key, nope
Holler at God, "Man why'd you had to take my folks?"
Hope to see freddy G, Yusef G, love my G, Rolly G
Police watch me smoke my weed and count my G's
Got a lot of people countin' on me
And I'm just tryin' to find my peace
Should of finished school like my niece
Then I wouldn't finally wouldn't use my piece
Aw man, this pressure
I've been workin' this graveshift
And I ain't made shit
I wish I could
Buy me a spaceship and fly, past the sky
I've been workin' this graveshift
And I ain't made shit
I wish I could
Buy me a spaceship and fly, past the sky
I remember havin' to take the dollar cab
Comin' home real late at night
Standin' on my feet all damn day
Tryin' to make this thing right
And havin' one of my co-workers
Say, "Yo you look just like
This kid I seen in the old Busta Rhymes
Video the other night"
Well easy come, easy
Go how that sayin' goes
No more broad service
Cars, and them TV shows
And I all had that snatched from me
And all the faculties
All turn their back on me
And didn't wanna hear a rap from me
So naturally, actually
Had to face things factually
Had to be a catastrophe
With the fridgest starin' back at me
'Coz nothing's there, nothing's fair
I don't wanna ever go back there
So I won't be takin' no days off
Until my spaceship takes off
I've been workin' this graveshift
And I ain't made shit
I wish I could
Buy me a spaceship and fly, past the sky
I've been workin' this graveshift
And I ain't made shit
I wish I could
Buy me a spaceship and fly, past the sky
I wanna fly, I wanna fly
I said, "I want my chariot
To pick me up and take a brother for a ride"
