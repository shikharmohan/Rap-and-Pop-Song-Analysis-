And I'm doin' 'bout a hundred thousand miles
Doggy style all in your earhole 
Gonna get funky 'cause I know thats what you here for
You bouncin' your neck and bobbin'your head
What I'm tryna do here is wake the dead
Follow instructions

Bustin' my functions
Bumpin', funkin', jumpin'
Man these suckers on the mic ain't sayin' nothin'
So really you ain't really gettin' nothin'

Cause they just want a piece of the Undercover Brother
Wanna take him home tonight
Cause he's so dynamite
Sold him like Dolamites

Snoopie Doopie
And nothin' for Bootsie
(Bootsie)
Turn it loose
I'm just funkin' with my nephew Snoop
Where you get your funk from?
Now lets get ready to shoot
Undrecover Brother, the one you will discova
You can't get a piece what's under his sheets
