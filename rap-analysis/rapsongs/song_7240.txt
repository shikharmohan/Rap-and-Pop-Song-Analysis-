Ay, where the piano at Shawty?
Y'all ain't never seen a dope boy play the piano
And rap at the same time, have you?
I'ma show you somethin', dig this
I'm 22 and a vet in the game
Say I'm super coo', still a threat at the same
Time, rhyme bout the times I invested in 'caine
Pleasure and pain in every aspect of the game
I'm the answer to yo prayers if you prayin' for change
So, I dare you compare us and say we the same
When I'm, climbin' the ladder, they stuck in the same
Mind frame, they accomplishments are nothin' to gain
Eventually, see I'm outta yo range
Except this rose gold glow from my wrist and my chain
I entertain young niggaz who slang
Like a picture, no frame, see it's simple and plain
My shit bang, spit flames, put niggaz to shame
Flow so insane, lyrics stick in yo brain
Now you can't, mention my city unless you mention my name
T I P I M P, I'm the man
Ay, be easy, you don't want no trouble with me
Just be easy, the drama ain't nothin' to me
Ay, be easy, before you have problems just breathe
Ay, be easy, you ain't worth dyin', believe me
Just be easy, you don't want yo mama to grieve
Be easy, well mind yo business, don't bother the G
Be easy, swear you stuntin' but you frontin' to me
Be easy, behind the scenes or behind yo?
Ay, be easy
Kissin' ass when I came to leave
Set the standard for Atlanta, rearranged the lead
Okay, so what the fuck is fame to me?
I been plottin' since kindergarten, you'z a lame to me
I give the niggaz what they came to see
A reflection of one self where they aim to be
As you can see it ain't no change in me
And you won't meet another nigga off the chain as me
I'm so fly, no lie, don't deny it, ya feel it
So inspired by my style, decided to try it yo'self
Bet you won't, meet nobody ranked as high as myself
The checks you waitin' on, homes, I can sign them myself
Tote gats, dro smoked that, now I'm high
Seats way back in the Maybach I ride
Through the streets of the Westside, I slap five
And throw dubs, show love, nigga hate me nah
Ay, be easy, you don't want no trouble with me
Just be easy, the drama ain't nothin' to me
Ay, be easy, before you have problems just breathe
Ay, be easy, you ain't worth dyin', believe me
Just be easy, you don't want yo mama to grieve
Be easy, well mind yo business, don't bother the G
Be easy, swear you stuntin' but you frontin' to me
Be easy, behind the scenes or behind yo?
Ay, be easy
What it is pimp? T.I.P., Trap Muzik, understand that?
Grand Hustle pimp, ay, wus hattnin' Toomp?
Let's ride out homie, what it is mayne?
P and C, Pimp Squad Click, Shawty
Uh, uh, A-Town, stay down
Keep it pimpin', pimpin'
Ay, be easy
Ay, be easy
Ay, be easy
Ay, be easy
