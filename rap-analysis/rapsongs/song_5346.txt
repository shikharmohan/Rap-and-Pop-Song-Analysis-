[Missy - Verse One]
Don't explain, you never change
Same old thing, same old game
Say ya want, to be wit' me
But show me my ring
Baby, let me think
I been, in the cold
The story untold, about to unfold
How do you expect me
To ever believe, you won't be wit' me
[Chorus - Missy (Nicole)]
Why you all in my grill (why, you all, in)
Can you pay my bills (can you pay my bills)
Let me know if you will (let me know, let me know)
'cause a chick gotta live (a chick like me, I got to live)
[Missy - Verse Two]
Talk is talk, and talk is cheap
Tell it to her, don't say it to me
'cause I know, I'm in control
See tricks are for kids, and boo I'm too old
Go 'head, with your games
Don't ever come back, to me again
Where you go, remember me
I'm the best thing in history
[Chorus - Missy (Nicole)]
Why you all in my grill (why, why, why)
Can you pay my bills (can you pay my bills)
Let me know if you will (let me know, boy, boy)
'cause a chick gotta live (a chick got to live, ooh yea)
[Bridge One - Missy (Nicole)]
Third time (third time)
I moved you in, took you back
In my life (I was a fool)
I don't know, what's wrong with me
Third time (third time)
I moved you in, took you back
In my life
[Chorus - Missy (Nicole)]
Why you all in my grill (why you all, in my grill)
Can you pay my bills (can you pay my bills, yea)
Let me know if you will (let me know, let me know, baby, baby)
'cause a chick gotta live (a chick like me, I got to live, yea)
[Bridge Two - Missy]
If you want me
Where's my dough
Give me money
Buy me clothes
No need for talking
Have my dough
Where's my money
Where's my clothes
If you want me
(repeat)
[MC Solaar]
Zigzag zigzag, oui, j'ai du zigzaguer
De comÃÂ¨te en planÃÂ¨te ta salopette rosaguÃÂ©
shoot quand y'a des canettes, y'a plus d'bisou
Plus d'baisers, plus d'bises, juste un biz biz de bijoux
Tu veux du cling-cling clinquant, ne vit-on pas
sale top du top salsa plus Merco Classe A
Je braquerais les banques, toutes, tu ferais banqueroute
Boufferais des casse-croÃÂ»tes juste pour paver d'or ta route
J'jouerais ÃÂ  cache-cache pour trouver l'cash
Userais de la calache, de la tchatche, j'vendrais mÃÂªme du hash
Solaar trip j'excÃÂ¨de clean honnÃÂªte et net
T'offrira des tas d'poupÃÂ©es pleines de p'tites pÃÂ©pettes
J'aurais les poches vides, portrais le mÃÂªme jean
LÃÂªverais mon verre ÃÂ  la tienne, tu diras tchin-tchin
T'auras tout ce que sur terre le soleil fait briller
Joueras au monopoly, uh, avec des aiguillÃÂ©es
(music till fade)
