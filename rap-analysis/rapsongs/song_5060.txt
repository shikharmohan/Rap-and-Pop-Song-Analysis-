yea lets go lets go
microphone check, i make em all bounce
every teller and bank of America, make em all count 
you gon need da whole staff to add up the amount
its gon to take to pay me off to keep out yo house
to keep me n my zone, so that i don't  zone out
im rich and po like zone 4
thoughts as deep as tone loc
walk wit me like old folk, cross da street a scores goaled
i don't rap, i hockey rink cuz my flow(floor) is so cold
i am on my mm hmm, they are on they oh no.. 
i am really in here(hair) they ain't real like soul glo
don't u know im so sho, them niggaz got no glow
find a master for(b4) you  can come back into the dojo
lupe got his mind right, nigga dis is my mic
and I've come to take it all back like miller hi lite
he must not be tied tight, back against the wall
he will throw a ball, like he playin Jai Alai
I'll do the register, you just get dem fries right
i don't trust America after watching zeitgeist
take a look at my stripes, chest look like a tiger arm
and im hot as tiger baum, fire like a five alam
and its set to tie a barn, get ya firefighter on
i ain't worried bout you hoes,i don't even need to roll
i turn down yo X like how you put yo tires on
once i get these tires on i buy a bomb and tie it on
and ride this around the entire song 
find a line to drive it on, park it near a metaphor
wait for it, the timers on
you can turn yo hydrants on, I'll jus turn my wipers on
wipe it off then wipe me down but don't 4get about my BOMB!
