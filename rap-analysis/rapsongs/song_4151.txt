GOOD MORNING NEW YORK!

[Hook]
YEEEAH!
Dough is what I got lil' mama,
Dough is what I got pretty lady
Dough is what I got Shawty
Dough is what I got baby
C'mon I'm, Paid, I'm Paid, I'm Paid, I'm Paid
[Verse 1]
Give a woman none (uh' uh')
I already gave my brother some
It's my sister's turn
Ain't it funny how the fish do birds
Wit ya boy, just relax like a fresh new perm
And the world in the barrel of the pistol turn
We get it how we live, Never Live and Learn
Gotta talk about the flow, 'cause you is concerned
Only Down South Rapper coulda been in da FIRM,
Or, Tha Commision, or a Wu Tang Nigga
Tried to tell ya I can kick it like Lu Kang Nigga
Got that Sub Zero Flow how you want me ma?
Nigga get over here like Scor-pi-on
And, When it comes down to this recordin',
Im must be LeBron James if he's Jordan
No!, I won rings for my performance,
I'm more of a Kobe Bryant of an artist
Same coach, same game been startin'
Same Triangle offense
I come through the lane like a dawgin'
Referee niggaz is lame, they call chargin'
I have no brain I'm Retarded
We all not the same I'm a Martian
You can be my Jane, I'm your Tarzan
I'm from the jungle where the snakes is all poison
I am Magnificent like Marcus
You might wanna fall back like August
I'm laced up Timbo whateva you call it
I hit niggaz in the head like Vonage
I am talking to no particular audience
But understand I am the guardian
And understand there won't be no guarding him
You will just get played like an accordion
I don't give a damn if she's bossy
I keep pussy runnin' like a faucet
She better catch like she Steve Largent
Because I'm ÃÂ¢€Ã"Wassup!ÃÂ¢€Ã like Martin
[Bridge]
HAHAHA...Yeah, See I know yall talking about me and you don't like what you hear sometimes
But uhh, Umm, Since Im so bright Ima put tha spot light on you baby
[Hook 2]

I know you need to stop, stop hatin'
I know what ya not whodi
And that is Weezy baby
Blunts Up, Now BLAZE, BLAZE, BLAZE, BLAZE
(Work It!)
[Verse 2]
Yeah, tell the world take Six
Young dictionary make words make sense
Then, I make cents make dolla's
Make the skinny girl holla
Make that fat girl hungry
Make the ugly girls want me
But the Pretty girls on me, 
Make the shy girls horny, make the fly girls corny
But On-ly for me, 'cause I prove that I A-M,
Holla back in tha mornin'
Hey, now holla back if you on shit
The CEO of the Moment
Bullshit, I don't condone it
Aw baby just hop on it
