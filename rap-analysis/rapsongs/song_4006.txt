[Chorus]
Living in a World a Fantasy 
(Livin in a World a Fantasy)
His Back agaist the wal
(Cut the music up in my phones}
Living in a World a Fantasy 
(Livin in a World a Fantasy)
Perfect
His back against the wall
(yeah)
[Verse 1 "Lil wayne"]
Yeah Straight off the corner Apple and Eagle
Brave hard bitch like the times Im medieval
Married to the block, Divorce the Cathedral
Standin on the corner selling Porcelean to People
Forced into evil, Its all in your head
It's also cerebral, call me Canival
You follow when i lead you
Straight to the needle 
The barrel, the battle, the beetles will eat you
Mama named Cita, I love You Cita
Member when your pussy Second husband used to beat ya
Remember when i went into the kitchen got the cleever
He aint give a fuck i aint give a fuck neither
He could see the devil, see the devil in my features
You could smell the ether
You can see Cita
You can see the Cita, see the Cita in my features
I am her voice and the World is my speaker
Im speakin
[Chorus]
Living in a World a Fantasy 
(Livin in a World a Fantasy)
His back agaisnt the wall
Living in a World a Fantasy 
(Livin in a World a Fantasy)
His back agaisnt the wall
[Verse 2 "Question"] 
With my spine up agaist these
Tagged up brick walls
Fliip grams, quick hands, Quicksand Pitfalls
Big Balls intact, through error Syntac's
That Stormy Whether where the Trees dont bend back
Left home at 16
I aint never been back
When it come to being broke i say i never been flat
I punk ass bitch i aint never been that
Reminisce how Daddy cuaghta "slitch" in his lap
 IN his newport box with only one stick left
Snort heroin then he'd shove me in the chest
Used to really believe, I never be the best
Hell must be on my shoulders Cuz the devil seent the rest
Right on it through his binge's and
Then poisinous Syringe's
Beaten on my mama kicked the doors of the hinges
I wish i was old enough to stop him when he did it
So long agao but even I cant forget it 
So listen
[Chorus]
Living in a World a Fantasy 
(Livin in a World a Fantasy)
His back agaisnt the wall
Living in a World a Fantasy 
(Livin in a World a Fantasy)
His back agaisnt the wall
[Verse 3 "Question"]
Demonic in my presence
Street corner like a reverend
Tryna find the change, Shining lightining like im in heaven
Triple seven, Triple Six
Trebulations, Triple trip
Triple grip, triple spitiin' like a had a trple lip
Lets make simple sense of the main difference
Angel if Death's Wing gotta s sinner in a Clench
Revolver in my fist, Earthworm to a fish
Bait on the line watch me cath them with this
Hope flound compound off round White rock
Ballin like Earl man i go in his high tops
Third eye cyclops, beaten down by five cops
Left for dead and it aint even my block
Think of my pops, thinkin of my moms
Rather be just blazin listenin to Saigon
Cuz when u think up, God strikes you down
Body full of current lightenining never hit the ground
[Chorus]
Living in a World a Fantasy 
(Livin in a World a Fantasy)
His back agaisnt the wall
Living in a World a Fantasy 
(Livin in a World a Fantasy)
His back agaisnt the wall
