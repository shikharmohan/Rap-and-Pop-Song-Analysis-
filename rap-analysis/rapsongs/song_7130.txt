PUNISHER --
Ay-yo my murderous rap verbal attack is actual fact
Tactical tracks match perfectly with graphical stats
Half a you lack the magical dap of tragical rap
That tackles you back and shackles and laughs at you
That's...the mathematical madness I'm on, the savage, the strong
The marriage, a bond of havoc and song
This massacre's on as if Picasso laced you
There's lotsa hateful skeletons locked
in the closet of my castle of Grayskull
I'm possum at grade school, that's why I have to debate you
My raps are like Capel, slashin' your face, you
That's how a master degrades you
I'm battlin' Jesus (hay-soos) if he passes through my label
I'm snatchin' his halo
God I pray that you send my father back as an angel
Language is fatal and it's hypnotizin'
I'm only emphasizin', I'm still all about business and enterprisin'
I'm super lyrical, a brain boosts the chemicals
That's used contenicals inside of my mental projectable
CHORUS -- Lyrically I'm supposed to represent (Biggie)
          Niggaz'll tell you that I'm nice with the
          blah, blah, blah (Canibus)
          Lyrically I'm...<
It's Okay
Tomorrow'll be a better day
When ya rent a day late and ya tryna stay straight
But the only way to get it is to slang that weight
Okay, tomorrow'll be a better day
We all Came in the world with a sparkle in our eye
Not knowing the only thing that we can promise is to die
A promise is a lot can't nobody guarantee it
And death around the corner can't nobody damn see it
I can't agree that God good at all time
But we all know shit aint all good at all time
So I tote my strap in the hood and all time
But respect aint just something that's understood in our time
Especially by our kind man I hate it for the future
Police don't wanna lock ya up no more they wanna shoot ya
And that's half as bad as these hatas'll do ya
As soon as ya get ya loot up they wanna shoot up
Lord forbid to kill me I bet ya nobody knew what
Suckas get shot and police come straight to us
And that jus how they do us ever since niggas blew up
I know ya goin through it know I'm goin thru it too bruh
When ya rent a day late and ya tryna stay straight
But the only way to get it is to slang that weight
Okay, tomorrow'll be a better day
When ya daughter like 6 and her pops aint shit
You aint wanna tell her you and momma gotta go strip
Okay, tomorrow'll be a better day
I'm doin this for the hood and the kid wit no dad
I was just like ya'll don't feel so bad
Know it's hard when ya live so bad
They whoop ya ass and they wonder why ya still so bad
For long, ya get whoopin's and just laugh
Momma washin' clothes and find a lil' blue bag
She ask what ya what ya doin ya tell her stuntin' like my daddy
You knew that I was gonna be a hustla when ya had me
Look around ma you sent me to the store to get some bread
And I'm passin' atleast 8 J's or mo'
Rent been late for 8 days or mo'
But slangin' blow a better habit than 8 days of snow
Ya out speedin' wit the white and ya see the blue lights
And ya on ya 3rd strike so the judge say life
Okay, tomorrow'll be a better day
If ya son 14 and his dad a folk criminal
Hard to realize it Baby girl but god with ya
Okay, tomorrow'll be a better day
My momma girl son 14 just got killed
Had to catch myself
Bout to tell her I know how ya feel
I'd a been a damn liar
See her tryin not to cry
She know he in a better place
But she just wanna know why
Know somebody touch mine
and a nigga gon' die
It's goin down
How dare I tell her to calm down
I tried to convince her that he in God's arms now
She said i don't believe that theres a God right now
I know its hard right now and ya heart light now
But God give new begginins u can start right now
Know ya scarred right now cuz you apart right now
But Shit you in better shape than we are right now
When ya rent a day late and ya tryna stay straight
But the only way to get it is to slang that weight
Okay, tomorrow'll be a better day
When ya daughter like 6 and her pops ain't shit
You aint wanna tell her you and momma gotta go strip
Okay, tomorrow'll be a better day
Ya out speedin' wit the white and ya see the blue lights
And ya on ya 3rd strike so the judge say life
Okay, tomorrow'll be a better day
If ya son 14 and his dad a folk criminal
Hard to realize it baby girl but god with ya 
Okay, tomorrow'll be a better day
