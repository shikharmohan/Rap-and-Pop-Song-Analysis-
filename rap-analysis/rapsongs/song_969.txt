Streets! Flipmode baby, yeah check it Busta bus baby
Yeah, rah digga now, c'mon
Check it, huh
If you ain't noticed yet I have come wit a throne
See I was gone for a minute but now I'm home
The way I touch it you can feel it in your bones
Fuck wit the kid cause I'm taking you into another zone
See it don't matter what you think or what you say
I always love for the street every single day
You better get down on your knees, you better pray
'Cause goin' against the grain of this squad
I promise you will pay
You see flipmode is the team that I rep forever
Respecting the code of honor staying together
It's getting hot I think you should take off the sweater
Rattle and knock all of your troops who goin' to get this cheddar
See when we come I'm wondering how they gonna manage
Show them mysteriously watch how they vanish
See when we finish just analyze all the damage
No matter who you are, we accept any and every challenge
Yeah yeah, I think we got 'em again this time
Flipmode c'mon
I think, I, I think wanna say something like this
People denying that they feeling our shit
So we hit them with the really crazy flow
To let them know that we be hitting it far sure
Time goes by, in your life
And we're still here together
I hope you know that this is really not a game
The way I put it down you will remember the name
The way we change it up shit is never the same
And when I'm finished I promise I'll have you niggas feel ashamed
For giving the people shit they ain't really loving
It's funny to me but you all niggas be bugging
But it's alright because I will continue flooding the streets
With heat for the ladies and niggas who be thugging
And if you want it then bring shit wit open arms
While I continuously give you niggas bombs
Asalama will make them will lake them so long
I'm in the abscence of confusion holding the world in my palms
I'm tired of telling you there ain't nothing greater
Swinging the torch and repping for violator
So tell the DJ to go and turn up the fader
Putting it down for the streets regardless what you saying playa
How many times am I gonna have to tell you all?
Flipmode run these streets, c'mon
I wish, I, I wish I had just a little more time
Instead I give you this and leave more on your mind
Me and Busta bus be making crazy doe
So you know that we be killing it for sure
Time goes by, in your life
And we're still here together
I will be here just to hold you down
We'll still be around
'Cause we will rock forever
Dirty reppin' the squad, don't even get me started
Getting worldwide love keeping the street regardless
Ever since kindergarten, always been the sharpest
Doin' this for my fam 'cause home is where the heart is
Other crews could chill, all of you all days are numbered
Bus got the yellow digga coming in the navy Hummer
Start quality, guess I should thank my Mother
"Bionic woman" on the mic like I was Jamie Sommers
Now, I know that you don't wanna really take it there
Digga and bus you know we make the perfect pair
We keep it gully wit a little Latin flare, it's unfair
Oh well, how I still be spitting and keep everybody all up in the mix
