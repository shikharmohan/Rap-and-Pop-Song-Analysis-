[RedMan] {intro}
Yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo  check it out
Introducing, the International, Worldwide, Brick City
[Roz]
To each's own, I'ma have this known from the door
I make niggas walk like ball four
Y'all score game down the block, for me it's hip-hop
Around the clock, critical I'm bound to drop (stop)
You ain't know, I'm nice girl, youse a Wannabe
Like the Spice Girls, you better think twice girl
I'm untry-able, undeniable
Won't be held liable for giving knots that's untie-able
R-O-Z, recognize my name
Rap G.I. Jane rocking colorful wide frames
Straight from Newark we Brick layers, Na Na slayers
Don't play our coach and pick players in Da Bricks
Get your shit popped locked and stolen
Step back I'm holding, bitches be rolling
Ghetto style, I'ma stay that ripper
Tryin to get cash out the ass like a stripper
[Tame One]
Dub O, I'm down for whatever
Do what I gotta to get the cheddar
Fuck taking over cities, we conquered galaxies and better
I was put here to crush CD's and wreck tapes
Make a false move, I put this whole fucking planet in checkmate
Hell with this, we taking over the spot
I don't like to, but I will resort to the glock
The whole camp is sick, you can't do nothing but like it
It's like when you drown, your ass sink quicker if you fight it
Talking 'bout you used to rob niggas with pump shotty
I know you love club music nigga
But you ain't got a jack in your body
You fake ass niggas, getting screened like a short pass
And if you incorrect
I'ma diamond cut your bastard ass
You got mind control over me like Debo but you ain't my friend
Cause when I'm around you be quiet but when I leave you be talking again
But we gonna do it how you want cause I'm with it to brawl with you
Now what if I put your bitch ass in a headlock and fall with you
Y'all niggas, shut your windows and close ya doorz
Coming straight from Da Brick City (2X)
(C'mon Z)
[Young-Z]
Your bitch said aliens raped her and her four friends
But it was all or outs, we dressed up as Martians
When I, crack a brew it's nothing else I'd rather do
Hop out a cab or two to your avenue to battle you
Your style get ate like Italian steak
Then I get Red to sell you achey or a pound of shake
Y'all can open up wide and suck this dick
None of y'all niggas can fuck with Bricks
While you scrubbing dishes, we puffing swishes
Fucking women ends up in the Benz trunk with switches
We cop sixty-three nigs
One from every spot, blunts be mystery mix
We got, spots, all my niggas stay in Bricks
While y'all stash clips in bags of Bar-B-Q potato chips
Plus your main honey loved us
Slip her some bom-ba she'll fuck twenty of us
[Gov-Mattic]
Yo, you pack that little ass gun like Harlem Nights
After we brawl and fight, yo bitch I'ma ball tonight
At shows we so tight we flow like it's one mic
Raw underground, yo Don, tell em what that dough like
[Diezzel Don]
D. Don, I gets mine, and stay getting it
My thug mind I'll brawl with rhymes
And stay shitting it
Check my shine, iced out platinum like your pendant
V.I.P. ghetto nigga, hustling and spending
Got bitches tricking trying to get with me
Got police, flocking niggas trying to cop from me
How many pounds you want, how many pounds you need?
I cultivate, every block I go and drop seeds nigga
I grow trees, niggas know me, for being low key
That hustler from A.C.
[Gov-Mattic]
I'm steady shitting on hoes
Grand Royal like the Green Eyed Bandit
Jump straight in the Lex off a New Jersey transit
Let my man spit that Don shit
Gov-a-Mattic spit that shit that's toxic, I rock shit
It's that hot shit like Busta Bust got
Plus I bust glock, on pussies I trust not
They get blown, burned like minutes on cell phone
Bring the terror to your block like the toughest nigga from jail home
And you dead gone when my squad come 'round
We hella illa from Isabella to Downtown
