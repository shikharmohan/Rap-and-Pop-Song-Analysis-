Good morning Mr. Bozack time to wake up the nuts
(For what)
To hit the shower, so I can wash the butt
Damn, word life I had a blast
(Last night was crazy)
It was ass for days nuts had a full tank of gas
Golly G word P tits and VD
Pussy kicking louder than my Alpine Benzi box
Yes, I fresh sweet like gumdrops
Pay me like Oprah and no one to cock block
Slow down big fella, I think, you're gassing me
(Why?)
P, get off my big dick, chill, stop harassing me
Your dick, you mean my dick and don't forget
Now let me scrub that head because it smells like fish
Mr. Bozack
Mr. Bozack
That's your fault, black no Jim hat
(Explain)
You got in some fly shit and stuck me in bear back
Smarty, what happened over there at the party?
Was it Vodka and smeared on a bit of Bacardi?
No dick, sorry Mr. Bozack
(Don't call me that)
But you didn't help, talking 'bout
(Where the hoes at?)
I was hard, hard enough to buck
(How hard)
(Shit, you didn't rush the pussy)
See, I stuffed her like a duck
Mr. Bozack, you went out like a sucker
(What?)
Not me, G P 'cuz you the one who bucked her
Hachoo damn, here's a tissue
(God bless you)
Yo, P I'm feeling sick
Relax, what can I get you? Tetracycline
No a penicillin cap, it burns
Yo, chill Mr. Bozack
No, I can't believe that screw that
(Cool Jack)
All you had to do was wear a Jim hat
I reached for one but didn't quite make it
She grabbed on your head piece, I couldn't quite take it
Now lounge Mr. Bozack, stop cryin' like a wuss
Now bone up the nuts, G 'cuz yo, there's more puss
Look, P, the B O Z is like Audi
Audi like who
Motherfuckin' Kurt Gowdy
It's the Jim oww, it burns
Don't worry, G
I'll have ya hooked up on Friday
We'll go get the shot real quick
Everything will be copestetic
Oh, what the hell all
Got to stab this hoe cake right?
