Ladies and gentlemen, it's about that time again
You know what I'm sayin'? It's about that time, check this out
We got Eve in the buildin', that's right, baby, we got Eve, E V E
[Incomprehensible]
Now I ain't never been the type to not excite ya
Can't miss the vixen that meant you like her
Play a position just might invite ya
Party till the mornin' if she like ya
I ain't attracted to no lame dudes, don't wanna name a few
Don't lie either, so don't ask she might be namin' you
When I'm allergic to these corny bitches
Tryna start shit to end my freeze unto upon my riches
Game been a part of me, dog and I'm a keep winnin'
Never should have started me off, I love the way I'm livin'
And they wonder why she won't stop
Sit around mumblin' to myself hopin' that my shit flop
Yeah, that's the shit I like to laugh at
Obsessed with my every move, dummy find a crash test
Every year I'm just a little wiser
Ah yeah, it's still goin', left in the race [Incomprehensible]
Yo, she got 'em like E
Everyday eatin' and takin' it to the V
Vixen V-12 with systems, E
Everybody keepin' it movin'
It's double R flowin' hard
This is Eve-Olution, now scream E
If you really ready we takin' it to the V
Vicious spit flows ridiculous, E
Say it like you know the letters
Bombshell when the clothes a fetish
Just scream my name for me
I'm a hustle till I'm stacked up
Lot more to do when it's cool then I'ma pack up
Pass the torch along to someone else
But right now hold me down, little selfish thinkin' of myself
Took a long time to make it here
Before I make a move I make a plan, just so I can be prepared
Ain't no turnin' back, it's heavy now, fuck the petty shit
Bigger better shit and I'm ready now
Yo, she got 'em like E
Everyday eatin' and takin' it to the V
Vixen V-12 with systems, E
Everybody keepin' it movin'
It's double R flowin' hard
This is Eve-Olution, now scream E
If you really ready we takin' it to the V
Vicious spit flows ridiculous, E
Say it like you know the letters
Bombshell when the clothes a fetish
Just scream my name for me
Okay, she talk a lot of shit, cocky got plenty lip
Promise myself that I never live penny less
Took a couple trips, hopped in and out of plenty whips
Stacked up the game, now she readin' plenty scripts
Yeah, I'm accustomed to the good life
But don't get it fucked up, I owe it all to the hood life
Congratulate her when you see her past
It's a shame how these shits get agitated when we cross past
But we ain't even on the same level
I'm thinkin' 'bout a sexy eye, baby girl, you still nice embezzled
Smelt right, had to have it
Third joint still goin' strong, I'm not braggin'
I guess I am a little bit though makin' it happen
Who'd have thought I'd be famous one day makin' it rappin'?
Philly, she done lost her mind
Another hit, dog, the last line
Yo, she got 'em like E
Everyday eatin' and takin' it to the V
Vixen V-12 with systems, E
Everybody keepin' it movin'
It's double R flowin' hard
This is Eve-Olution, now scream E
If you really ready we takin' it to the V
Vicious spit flows ridiculous, E
Say it like you know the letters
Bombshell when the clothes a fetish
Just scream my name for me
E V E, E V E
Scream her name for me
