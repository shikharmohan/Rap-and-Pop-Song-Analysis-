We're rockin' on and on until the early mornin'
We're rockin' on and on until the early mornin'
We're rockin' on and on until the early mornin'
We're rockin' on and on until the early mornin'
Break up the beat make it move like so
Make you feel nice so you can feel the flow
Downright funk on cruise control
Do a slam dunk, put a bita' soul into the hole
You got your game wrapped tight, no need to slow
Gonna crash this party, gettin' put a bit back
If ya gonna act more loose than you usually are
Everything's alright 'coz we get down like that
Now music is the key to make your body rock
24/7 around the clock
Most of the jams have the hip hop
They make you do your dance and do it non-stop
Now you can see the vibe when it's comin' your way
Gotcha' feelin' right within the party
Make you wanna grab ya girl and say
"Hey, let's get down and do it your way"
We're rockin' on and on until the early mornin'
We're rockin' on and on until the early mornin'
We're rockin' on and on until the early mornin'
We're rockin' on and on until the early mornin'
Don't make a move just bust it out
When yo' party with us don't fuss about
If yo' want to have a good time
All y'all gotta do is free your mind
Just relax and take a chill
This is your night, do what ya will
Don't stop until you see the sun
And make sure you are havin' fun 'coz
The brothers make the songs that make you smile
Up jump the boogy and make your style
Home grown love from the heavens above
Put you in the mood you been dreamin' of
So jump on it, baby, don't get uptight
We bought it, baby, the way we just know you like
Ain't no way you could get it wrong
Just let yourself go and get it on
We're rockin' on and on until the early mornin'
