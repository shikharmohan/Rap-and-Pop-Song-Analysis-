(Hook)
I Use To Tote A .38 Up In My Crack Days.
I Tote That AK-47 In My Rap Days (x4)
(Verse 1)
I'm Too Fly, I Can't Stay Up In My Bat Cave.
Hello, Say Goodbye When The Gat Wave.
Hold On To Your Surf Board When The Gat Wave.
Homie, You Can Be Deleted Like Backspace.
I'm Coming Threw Like A Fax Page.
I'm Just A Gorilla In A Unlatched Cage.
I Peel Off Like Black Tape.
Weed & Syrup, Good Combination Like A Crack Safe.
Uhmm, Real Nigga In The Building. Where The Cris At?
I Got Them Twins With Me, You Know, Click Clack.
I Got Them M's With Me, You Know, Big Stacks.
I Stay On The Right Side When That Bridge Crack.
Cash Money, Everything Understood.
Everybody Hop On A Lil Wayne That Could.
Haha, Hollygrove, That's My Hood.
Eagle Street Is Where I Stood.
Bwoy!
