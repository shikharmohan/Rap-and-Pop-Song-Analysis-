The loser, microphone abuser
Feet hurtin', I just walked from Jerusalem
So you should get on the side with the movement
I'm the proof and I'll die just to prove it
Whatchu wanna know, anything, whatever
I can't tell you, I could show you better
Me, me and my gun, we took an oath together
Said, I would never die if we both together
Yeah, this is my testification
I'mma Wayne on their heads like precipitation
And in hell, you, you need justification
But, but for me, it was just a vacation
Somebody tell me
When's it gonna end, when's it gonna end?
I'm runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin' home
When's it gonna end, when's it gonna end?
I'm runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin' home, yeah
I lost all my money, I lost half my mind
Can't find my direction, where's the finish line?
Could I be that far away from it all, how far to go?
If I stay for it all then I shouldn't fall
But if I fall, I fall up and let the clouds hug me
And if I fall down, I bet I hit the ground runnin'
Bet you searched and found nothin', lookin' for the finish line
Stop short cuttin', you fuckin' up your finish time
Shit, but every twice in a while
It feels like I'm runnin' and life is the miles
Yeah, but until the lights dim and down
I'll be runnin' around, runnin'
Somebody tell me
When's it gonna end, when's it gonna end?
I'm runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin' home
When's it gonna end, when's it gonna end?
I'm runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin' home, yeah
Countin' all my pennies but it doesn't add up
At their mercy but somehow it ain't enough
Readin' all the red lights tryin' not to give up
But I don't know how long it's gonna last
It's almost over now
I say, it's almost over now
The end is gettin' closer now
Better do what you're suppose to
'Cause the world is oh, so short to die, yeah
When's it gonna end, when's it gonna end?
I'm runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin' home
When's it gonna end, when's it gonna end?
I'm runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin' home, yeah
When's it gonna end, when's it gonna end?
Runnin', runnin' home
Yeah, I'm runnin' outta time, I'm runnin' out of space
Feel like I'm runnin' 'round but I'm runnin' in place
We all in the race, I'm just another sprinter
If there's no finish line then who's the real winner?
