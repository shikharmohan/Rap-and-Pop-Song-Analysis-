and it was written;
up in the book of life.
that man shall;
endure forever more.
well did you know the pen,
is stronger than the knife.
and they can kill ya once,
but they can't kill ya twice.
did you know distruction of the flesh is not the ending to life,
fear not of the anti-christ.
did you know that I,
exist before the earth.
and did you know my eyes,
are windows to the world.
did you know you can't go ah Zion and ah wear jerry curls,
can't tell di boys from di girls.
your body's just a vehicle,
transporting your soul.
it's what's inside the people,
is beauty to behold.
fear not of evil.
everyday the flesh,
it grow old.
changes of the times,
take a toll.

me say me want, freedom,
justice,
equality. 
as it was written in the book of life, 
then; 
so shall it be. 
me want to big up marcus garvey and me big up hughy p. 
and me wanna know washality. 
and i meant, reality.
i see it in the signs,
everyday i live.
it's clear to my mind,
somethin' got to give.
the system is the problem,
but it ain't just gonna change.
the people got to fight as one,
to break free from the chains.
we livin in a time,
where whitey got us cornered.
shackles on the brain,
police on every corner.
lookin for some soldiers,
but they so hard to find.
my elders say be patient,
'cause things come in time.
not fast enough because yo, 
they wanna rewrite me history. 
i made him a lot of mystery. 
'cause we too strong for them dis we.
because it was,
and now it is,
and it will definetly be.
we know,
the days is up.
blaze it up.
african warrior,
raise it up.
push it up.
fill up your cup.
we had enough.
we gonna buck.
now is the time.
open your mind.
then you will find.
it's a design.
no matter what you do,
no one can stop the time.
and me want no
kkk, no cia, no
police brutality.
ghetto youth and R.B.G.s,
we ridin for liberty.
been here,
before the start.
still here,
after it's over.
and it's written in every heart,
of every soldier.
