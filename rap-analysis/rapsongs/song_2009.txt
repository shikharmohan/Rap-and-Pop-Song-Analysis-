Uh, no, ride with me, ooh, babe
Uh, no, ride with me, oh, yeah
So many people wanna ride with me
Bumpin' thru the streets gettin' high with me
And if you're down to ride with me
'Cuz you're rollin' with the Row
Creepin' down the back street on Deez
I got my Glock cocked 'cuz niggas want these
Now, soon as I said it, seems I got sweated
By some nigga with a Tek 9 tryin' ta take mine
Ya wanna make noise, make noise
I make a phone call my niggas comin' like the Gotti boys
Bodies bein' found on Green leaf with their fuckin' heads cut off
Motherfucker I'm Dre, so listen to the play by play, day by day
Rollin' in my '4 with sixteen switches and got sounds for the bitches
Clockin' all the riches, got the hollow points for the snitches
So, would you just walk on by 'cuz I'm too hard to lift
And no this ain't Aerosmith, it's the motherfuckin' D R E
From the CPT on a rhymin' spree, a straight G
Hop back as I pop my top ya trip
I let the hollow points commence to
Pop, pop, pop, yeah 'cuz if it don't stop
I have to put my shit in reverse
go back and take another stop 'cuz I'm
Rollin' down the motherfuckin' backstreets
Wit my drink and my cup and my strap in my lap, see
Ain't nothin' but the G Funk, bumpin' in my [unverified]
Hell, yeah, wWith all the niggas sayin'

(With all the niggas sayin')
So many people wanna ride with me
Bumpin' thru the streets gettin' high with me
(Hell, yeah)
And if you're down to ride with me
'Cuz you're rollin' with the Row
Just another motherfuckin' day for Dre, so, I begin like this
No medallions, dreadlocks, or black fists, it's just that gangster glare
With gangsta raps, that gangsta shit makes a gang of snaps
Uh, word to the motherfuckin' streets and word to these
Hyped ass lyrics and dope beats that I hit ya with, that I get ya with
As I groove in my '4 on Deez, hittin' the switches
Bitches relax while I get my proper swerve on
Bumpin' like a motherfucker ready to get my serve on
But before I hit the dope spot
I gotta get the chronic, the Remy Martin and my soda pop
Now, I'm smellin' like Indonesia, bus stop full of fly bitches and skeezers
'Cuz my '4 on hit, pancake front and back, side to side
And all that shit, so, when I crawl I comes correct
Now, if your bitch in my shit, it's your bitch you check nigga
Now, let the Chevrolet slide as I dip a nigga trip to the South side, yeah
Right back up in you it's the D R E
Witta ounce as we bounce thru the CPT
Diamond in the back, gators on the wheels
This is strictly for my bitches, now we're hittin' in switches
Niggas gettin' jealous 'cuz hos be on our dick
But Dre don't give a fuck and I don't give a shit
So, the '4 won't blow, stoppin' by the spot to get some indo
With all the motherfuckin' bitches sayin'
So many people wanna ride with me
Bumpin' thru the streets gettin' high with me
(Hell, yeah)
And if you're down to ride with me

Bumpin' thru the streets gettin' high with me
(No, hell, yeah)
And if you're down to ride with me
'Cuz you're rollin' with the Row
It's like Long Beach, Compton, LA and Wotts
I come thru beatin' down your block wit a million plus watts
I burn double peelout, check it out, it's me now
It's young Daz from the pad, homie, watch me skee'd out
I'm on a mission to mission with tha time for the streets
Me and my homeboys clownin' we be bouncin' to the beat
I come thru rattlin' and shakin' plus I break down walls
Me and my doggs ain't breakin' no law
Put the [unverified] in the verse, took a sip for the thirst
Swervin' by the curb while blazin' the 'erb, nickel bird
She got my sounds, the way I floss throughout the town
Me and my partners from the Row, partners from the Pound
Big Style, Joe Coomey and Snoop, Nate and Kurupt
Tray Deee, Technique, BadAss and Doggystyle
Put it work, day and night, night and day, but any day
