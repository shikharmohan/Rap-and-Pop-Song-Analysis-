I know you like my style
You like how I break it down
I know you like my style
You like how I break it down
I know you like my style
You like how I break it down
Wanna get rich I'll show you how
Wanna get rich I'll show you how
On ya mark, get set, let's go, switch the flow
Teach ya how to turn yayo in to doe
The original don dada nobody bomb harda
Ya heard what I said boy, I'm hot, I'm hot
The hood rats they say "He so crazy"
The snitches they say "He tried to spray me"
That's what you get for tryin' to play me
The aftermath and my wrath is so shady
No matter how you try you can't stop it
I catch ya stuntin' in the Bentley Coupe cockpit
If you a pimp why ya hoes stay outta pocket
Front and find out how my P 40 glock hit
50 you need some help chill yo, yo I got this
Where I'm from the D's tryin' to knock us
They swear to god that it's me sellin' the chop pas
Man I ain't give them lil' niggas no product
I know you like my style
But how much do you like my style
You like how I break it down
Wanna get rich I'll show you how
I know you like my style
But how much do you like my style
You like how I break it down
Wanna get rich I'll show you how
The birds they say I got a way with words
I be like baby girl I like them curves
If ya not busy tonight then we can swerve
I'm a bachelor baby, fuck what you heard
From the tellie in ten minutes I'll make you a believer
Tongue touch ya'll have ya shakin' like you havin' a seizure
I make hits about what I do in my leisure
G Unit gang, can't another clique out to see us
Niggas lip sync the lyrics cuz they wanna be us
Groupie hoes from the hood they be trying to G us
Try to holla at the kid, every time they see us
Girlfriend quit pretending I'm the nigga ya love
And I ain't got to say nuttin' you know that I'm thugin'
Wit my hands on dat ass and ya say that I'm buggin'
We family baby, kissin' cousins now
Look what the riff raff done drug in
For the cheese my degrees is hotter then ya oven
I'm a New Yorker but I sound southern
And we sip DP till the don stop bubblin'
After we play, ok, got to ya husband
I know you like my style
But how much do you like my style
You like how I break it down
Wanna get rich I'll show you how
I know you like my style
But how much do you like my style
You like how I break it down
Wanna get rich I'll show you how
'Em said you gone like my style
Dre said you gone like my style
I said you gone like my style
You like how I break it down
You're not really, really ready ready
The drama will have ya ass in trauma boy
You're not really, really ready ready
My knife flip open and then I gets to pokin'
You're not really, really ready ready
Them shells start poppin' and bodies get to droppin'
You're not really, really ready ready
You think ya ready, ya not
You're not really really ready ready
