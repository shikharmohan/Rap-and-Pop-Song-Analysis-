Shit but thats just how it go when a nigga gettin dough like,
ohhh, you know the niggas dont like that
[Verse 1]
I hear you talkin hater but you aint sayin nothin,
I hear you talkin hater but you aint sayin nothin,
I hear you talkin hater but you aint sayin nothin,
Man i let him keep talkin, let alone this motherfuckers barkin
Im a grown ass man, you want a C.I.D.
Filthy rich on the floor, fuck V.I.P.
Got my hand on my gripe, other hand on my waist
2 steppin to the beat, I chunked my set in a niggas face like, 
ohh, this beat got me bouncin like a check
and my ground wroted G's, causin stats on my specs
I move you like money, If i see it then im stackin it
Your wife in my show, & my shot is so accurate
You niggas like acitivists, appealing to the phsykie
Man Malone a get it jerkin, I just do it like Nike
See I'm really with the fight team, & I'm really with the vented man
Im married to the game, & as god as my witness
[Chorus]
Im in da Club throwin down something clean out front like,
uhh, you know the niggas dont like that
Lookin so damn fly send the corpse through the sky like, 
ahh, you know the niggas dont like that
Spend a hundred on my dime piece so if you aint a dime piece,
whooh, you know the niggas dont like that
Shit but thats just how it go when a nigga gettin dough like,
ohhh, you know the niggas dont like that
[Lil Wayne-Freestyle]
Yeaaa
Weezy F matchin with Bird Baby
VRP's, SB's, matchin shirt, maybe
White T, Neck V, glasses are Versace
Married to the mob, but im a bachelor baby
Love is in the air, I put on a Gas Mask
I rather be there first, than the ass glass
I'm a Gorilla, call me Sasquach,
and I keep my army with me like M.A.S.H.
Light up the purp, pass it like Steve Nash
Bitch your so hot i give yo ass a heat flash
Young Money boy, I'm on 03' cash
Such a CEO, like my homie D-Dash
Gas... we mash like Pac and the outlaws
and we stand-up, and try not to down-fall
tryin to reach my goal, like a round-ball
Freddy'll do anything for the crown yall
David Beckham, on pay'em or respect' em
pop one pop two, bitch i'm on a triple decker
Icicle on my necklace, on my cashmere sweater
Keep a shotgun, I'm a hunter like heather
yessir, shuddup and listen to the professor
or it could get ugly like Esther
Whether in the South or that Westcoast weather
I'm poppin, Malone is stoppin
[Chorus]
Im in da Club throwin down something clean out front like,
uhh, you know the niggas dont like that
Lookin so damn fly send the corpse through the sky like, 
ahh, you know the niggas dont like that
Spend a hundred on my dime piece so if you aint a dime piece,
whooh, you know the niggas dont like that
Shit but thats just how it go when a nigga gettin dough like,
ohhh, you know the niggas dont like that
[Chorus #2]
If you got a fly ride put your keys in the sky scream,
eyy, you know the niggas dont like that
If you feelin like a star spend a thousand at the bar scream,
ohh, you know the niggas dont like that
If theres honeys in your purse ass hikin up the skirts scream,
ayy, you know the niggas dont like that
If your girls sheeted up & your ass whipped up scream,
ohh, you know the niggas dont like that
[Verse 2]
Drop a hundred on my watch, a couple hundred on the chain (chain)
Whip out front cost a half a whole thang (thang)
Drop your drores with the automatic doors
Fifty on the pinky, twenty five on my hoes
Stunna man been ballin since the eightnigs
Ball fifty whips and ball one for my ladies ( for my ladies)
Betcha bottom dollas jewels aint flaws (aint flaws)
Cash money ball til ya fall 
[Chorus]
Im in da Club throwin down something clean out front like,

Lookin so damn fly send the corpse through the sky like,

Spend a hundred on my dime piece so if you aint a dime piece,
whooh, you know the niggas dont like that
Shit but thats just how it go when a nigga gettin dough like,
