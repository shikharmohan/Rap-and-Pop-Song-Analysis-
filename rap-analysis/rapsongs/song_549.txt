Krayzie Bone and the bone with my mighty, mighty warriors
With my mighty, mighty warriors
'Cause this is all real, what you see
I said, it's all real, it's just the thug in me
Nigga just because Krayzie quiet speak less
Don't be mistaking my kindness for weakness
Humble but ready to rumble
My violent side I can't deny
I'm like a Jekyl and Hyde, Gemini
Look if you see me quiet
Then I'm plotting to riot why tell me why tell me why
I'm labeled a menace but I like it
Destroy ya paranoia will make me blow you away but hey
Nigga got to close to me and that ain't how it's supposed to be
Nigga want respect but what do you show me you
Playa hate and anticipate the day that you can see me fall
Better act like yo know I'm rolling with Mo posse up
Do damage and manage to wiggle our way out of handcuffs
As we strut as thugs
We must doin' our best to obey god violent in these times
Got to do what you gotta do war till ninety-nine
Slim nigga gotta get up and go and get it if it's really coming
Now I got it and I'ma floor the niggas acting
The safety's off come and get it if you really want it
(Hey, hey, hey)
It's hating baby, they gotta be so cold the gotta be heartless
In certain situations like retaliation
'Cause this is all real, what you see
I said, it's all real, it's just the thug in me
Niggas be keeping it all real, we keeping it all real
With the real if it's real, stay, be real
Niggas be keeping it all real, we keeping it all real
With the real if it's real, stay, be real
We come with nothing but the real thing, baby
Krayzie got nothing but the real thing, baby
We come with nothing but the real thing, baby
Krayzie got nothing but the real thing, the real thing
Baby, now this is the sound of me and my trues
We put this down way down
So now if you hear me releasing some shells
Hit the ground with the quickness lay better stay down on the dark side
Take a look and you'll find true niggas like no other kind
Nigga say fuck the wine indo inside swisher sweet get me high
Ain't nothin', get to nothin', somethin' got to be real
Real, somethin' got to be real
Ain't nothin', get to nothin', somethin' got to be real
Real, somethin' got to be real
I still be thuggin' in the khakis boots and skullies
And since I'm weed, fiend for the green
Nigga gotta make that money man
I still be thuggin' in the khakis boots and skullies
And since I'm weed, fiend for the green
Nigga gotta make that money man
It's real always, it's real always, it's real always, it's real always
It's real always, it's real always, it's real always, it's real always
Last night, IP.O.D'd next to me, ouija, ouija
And I fell in this fucked up state of mind
Slipped in the dream and I see demons telling me it's time to die
Why me I see some niggas they creeping outside my window
I'm ready to bang, bang, bang, aim the 12 gauge pump let my lead go
Give it up for the bloody murda, mo bloody murda, mo, mo
See a nigga when he go through the window
Had to put a bigger hole in his soul
If he get away running out my back door with me sawed-off swinging
Get ready to duck now to the guts buck pap, pap, pow
I claim my thang to slang
(Murda mo, murda mo, murda mo, murda mo, murda mo, murda mo)
Them bloody bodies kill 'em all send them hoes up in flames
Krayzie, insane to the brain
I claim my thang to slang
(Murda mo, murda mo, murda mo, murda mo, murda mo, murda mo)
Them bloody bodies kill 'em all send them hoes up in flames
Krayzie, insane to the brain
Now I know I done did some dirt in my time
'Cause the devil was stressing my mind
Messing with my mind nigga
Bone don't know, every day they lie
Turn to realize that everyday I can do it if I only pray
Maintain, 'cause a nigga was lusting
For money had to get it cause a nigga was struggling
I hit him with the Mossberg, y'all heard about Mr. Sawed-off
Leather face till them lay round, after round, after round
They'll fall down, down
May they lay from the eruption man
We putting them six feet deep, we buck, we bang
'Cause this is all real, what you see
I said, it's all real, it's just the thug in me
'Cause this is all real, what you see
I said, it's all real, it's just the thug in me
'Cause this is all real, what you see
I said, it's all real, it's just the thug in me
