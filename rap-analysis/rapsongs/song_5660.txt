Woman you know I love you
Woman you know just how I feel
You try to tell me that you don't know
When I know you know the deal
Woman you know I love you
Woman you know I care
Hey, You try to say I'm running game
You try to say baby you don't play fair, oh darling
If there is any doubt in your mind
I want you to be sure
If you don't ever see me again
I want you to be sure
That I love you, oh girl
Oh baby, I love you
Darling I love you, hey
Oh darling I love you, hey
Turn the lights down low
Turn the lights down low
Oh baby, you got to understand how I feel
You need to understand where I'm coming from
Ain't no need to be afraid
Ain't no need to get up and run
Oh darling, oh girl you know I love you
Oh darling, you know I know I love you, oh baby
If you never see me again, I need you to be sure
From this moment right now till for ever more
Said I love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, baby
Woman I love you
Woman I love you
Woman I love you
Woman I love you
