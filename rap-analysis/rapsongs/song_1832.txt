(do you know what a dog needs?) 
Dog needs a...(grr..) x2 
Baby I am what I am 
I'm gonna be who I be 
everything from chasing the cats 
to pissing on a tree. 
Let me see what I gotta see 
do what I gotta do 
DOG FOR LIFE!!! 
but keep it true. 
Every once in a while 
I'll break out the backyard to roam 
when I get back 
I still know that 
HOME IS HOME! 
And when I get there I'm gonna sit there. 
take it up there, 
who the fucks there, 
handing them my biggest... who? what? 
then I run until I bust my gun in, 
ya gotta be quick, 
and when I come home 
I gotta go so just give me the whip. 
I ain't got time for the lip, 
just open the fence. 
Let me go, 
I'll come back, 
I ain't got time to convince. 
Ever since I was a pup 
I've been stuck on the streets. 
To keep the heat, 
ya gotta eat,
I'll pass in a week, 
because im out there wanted all of those times I done it. 
(Aaliyah) 
I know youd kill for me, die for me, 
I know you like to rip and run the streets. 
but I get worried sometimes baby, 
I can't help to think, you might not make it 
home to eat, I fell asleep. 
Now would you pick up a phone, 
call me at home so I 
know you aint in some heat, 
and don't go crying alone ya know im looking out for 
you because your looking out for me. 
(Chorus) 
can you make this promise to me, that you'll be back in one piece? x5 piece 
piece piece.......
