[Method Man]
The mad stola, the mad stola
(Who? Russel who?)
Ha ha, nah let me stop
Word up this is a Def Jam production
Featuring, Johnny Blaze word up
Another madman joint, dirtman on the track
Watch how I flip the script, flip the script
Check the steez (believe that)
Check it out now, check it check it out
I get drunk off of cheap wine and hold frontline
Niggas wanna front, fine
Fuck with me and mine
Rain on your sunshine
Swine niggas comin hard as a pork rind
Can you dig it, only five percent live it
While the rest of you fake niggas try to get it
Who the Stallion, half of y'all need to quit it
Frontin hard and be soft as a cotton knit
No balls at all, if you do son then get with it
I'm razor sharp and my jaw bone I might spit it
I'm dealin with it on an everyday basis
Growin weary, gettin cold as I stack glaciers
In the zone it's Tical want to get stoned
Throw your hands in the air and puff a Meth bone
Did you ever get the feeling for that phat shit
Somethin different from that R&B; and rap shit
Well here it come from the gums of the one, I amaze
I fire in the sky, peep me now, Johnny Blaze
Check it, my mind's on the rhyme, ain't a damn thing funny
Get money, blaze with resent, kill the fraudulent
Fucker givin me the grill
Nowadays everybody tryin to keep it real
4th Disciple hit me with that 30/30 rifle
Beats from the streets mega-trifle
Rap gymnastics, flippin from the cradle to the casket
Take another pull, fantastic
It's the Method not the Plastic Man
Comin down like hourglass sands, check the tactic
Flow P.L.O., P.L.O. now you know
The ultimate and rhyme legittin
Peep the counterfeittin or get snake bitten
Doped up with deadly venom, Johnny Blaze get up in em
Lay em out like Lee did em, can you dig it
Can a brother eat, can I live it
Gets no deeper, whoever slippin get the sleeper
Whole faces of death, bodies cold
On some Evil Dead part 2, swallow your soul
Yeah, and it don't stop
The body body body body rock, yeah
Hip hop, who sat out in the dark
We used to do it out in the park
Hill Avenue, ain't a damn thing new
Stay true to my Clan, I'm a family man
Loyalty brought me royalty
To the Gods I give my heart and soul totally
It's so hard can't be broken, that's my life
I'ma die if I think twice, I'm not jokin
To the essence if I'm half steppin
Politician use the system, a lethal weapon
When we slip up, lethal injection
Ha, everyday life's a lesson
I take my spot in the lower class section
Johnny Blaze, 9-5 to the 9-6
Word up, keep it movin
