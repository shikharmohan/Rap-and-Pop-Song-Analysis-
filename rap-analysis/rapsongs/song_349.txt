Let me get to the point real quick
When your pockets are thick  mad chicks be on a brotha's tip
When you sportin' jewels and drivin in a groovy car
all the hoes gonna slut you like a movie star
to get in your pockets that's what them girls wanna do
but if you not rich then them chicks gonna front on you
no matter how strong your rap
you only knock boots when you got loot and you're on the mack
cause if your broke you'll get a whack slut
if you got doe you get a hoe wit a fat butt
with fresh skin long hair and a cute face
and if you live alone shes gonna pack her suitcase 
-and move in
then you start losin 
all your bucks
soon you broke asa joke and outta luck
then she takes off and brakes off 
your hoes gone so long dear
I'm outta here
That good relationship's been torn
Cause when you're on top everythings o.k.
But when you broke you gets no play
Chorus:
If you don't got endz you won't be getting no skinz
And if you don't got money, you won't scoop a honey
If you don't got cash you won't be getting no ass
And if your not clockin loot you won't be knockin no boots
Girls in the ninetieys ain't nothing but crooks
Its all about whats in your pockets  not how you look
That's why you can't talk to just any whore
Leave a brothers for the next man cause he got a penny more
They want a drug dealer not a scholar 
Some girls barely speak but always askin for a dolla
And if your pushin a fresh benz they'll be your best friends YEEEAH
as long as you collect endz
You think shes all yours but as soon as your dough go the hoe go now you solo
But when you was makin paper sellin (jo polls?) you bought dumb clothes for allathem bum hoes
And you was takin-em to the movies every weekend
Now that you dead broke them girls stop speakin
Cause nowadays them girls want you to trip
The only thing they can get from Big L is a big _______.
Cause when your on top everythings o.k.
But when you broke you gets no play.
CHORUS x2
I tell it like it is cause I'm a bold figa
And I hate a money-hungry girl a.k.a. gold-digger
It ain't even funny
Some girls don't even know me askin me can they get some money
I'm looking nothing like your poppa
I wouldn't give a chick 10 cent to put cheese on a whoppa
They want to know why  I'm so fly
A girl asked me for a ring and I put one-around her whole eye
Chicks yousto diss but now they wanna kiss
Yo showbiz imma break it down like this
CHORUS x2
Its like that yall 
And that's a fact yall
I hit hoes from the back 
And don't give a jack yall
Its Big L yall
I'm livin swell yall
I do my fame  that's why my name ring bells yall
(Backup) If you don't got endz

(Backup) If you don't got endz
(Backup) If you don't got endz
(Backup) If you don't got endz
