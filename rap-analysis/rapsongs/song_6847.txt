Yeah, this pimping stay open all night
Check this out, Jellyroll
We do break hoes, we don't fuck with fake hoes
Yeah, we make hoes, strip down to their panty hose
Pop your whip, now grab that bitch, pimpin' Snoop ain't havin' it
Oh, you like pussy? Congratulations
I'm tryin' to get your ass in my congregations
I keep three hoes in my room at one time
Two nickels and the other's a dime
You wouldn't wanna, keep a hood on her
When I'm dropping that motherfuckin' wood on her
'Cause I perform, I G like Warren
A nigga getting paid off shootin' porn
They call me, the black folks President
Snoop Hefner mixed with a little bit of Doggy Flynt
Banging this parliament, come get a bar with this
You would wanna be a part of this, oh bitch ass nigga
Quit playing with the hoe, and let me borrow the bitch
You got what I want, tell me if you want, just what I want
'Cause I got, what you need, baby, if you need some, get it from me
'Cause I got, what you want, I want you to want, just what I want
Just want, what I want, ooh, you got just what I want
Look mama, make you hot like a corn to pop
And watch how fast you see a nigga boxers drop
I'm trying to work it fast, but I know you like it slow
You know, I got to bust a nut and hurry up and go
You got something that I want, right now
Hurry up and let me put the black spot on the cow
Make the pussy ball up like salt to a snail
And when I kill it big daddy, I want you to tell
'Cause I don't give a damn when it come to freaking hoes
Call up forty hoes, and have a rolly peep show
And when you give me something, you gone want something back
This dick to your mouth, little mama like that
Fish cost too much, so I feed her sardines
Man I'm the motherfucking MVP of the team
Cold game how a nigga steady spitting this shit
Make her mama jump back and say, "Bitch is a pimp"
You got what I want, tell me if you want, just what I want
'Cause I got, what you need, baby, if you need some, get it from me
'Cause I got, what you want, I want you to want, just what I want
Just want, what I want, ooh, you got just what I want
Love potion number nine, bitch, I got that antidote
Got a bigger dick that'll crack your spine
Then I'm gonna lay it inside your throat
Tricked out, kicked out get her on gone
Ludacris on the motherfucking microphone
Hey, what's up I came to pimp
Fur hats and fur clothes, and a razor Tim
Bitch, I got it made
Just pick one of my hoes, and I got it laid
You never heard as many bitches so fast and frequent
Can I get the ends, bitch delinquents?
Run my bath water, cook my meals
And shut the fuck up when I book the deals
And iron my draws, give me cuffs and creases
It's your nephew come to fuck your nieces
You got what I want, tell me if you want, just what I want
'Cause I got, what you need, baby, if you need some, get it from me
'Cause I got, what you want, I want you to want, just what I want
Just want, what I want, ooh, you got just what I want
You got what I want, tell me if you want, just what I want
'Cause I got, what you need, baby, if you need some, get it from me
'Cause I got, what you want, I want you to want, just what I want
Just want, what I want, ooh, you got just what I want
Gimme, what I want, I got what you need
Gimme, what I want, yeah, yeah
Gimme, what I want
