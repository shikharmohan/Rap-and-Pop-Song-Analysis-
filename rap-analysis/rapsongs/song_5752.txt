Bismillah ir Rhman ir Raheem
What it is, what it is
What it is, what it is
What it is, what it is
What it is, what it is
See me, want me, get me, touch me
Feed me, fuck me, love and trust me
This whole world is cold and ugly
What we are is low and lovely
I am the most beautiful boogie man
The most beautiful boogie man
Let me be your favorite nightmare
Close your eyes and I'll be right there
While open, all over again
See me, touch me, get me, want me
Feed me, fuck me, trust and love me
This whole world is cold and ugly
What we are is low and lovely
I am the most beautiful boogie man
The most beautiful boogie man
Let me be your favorite nightmare
Close your eyes and ill be right there
While open, all over again again
Again
