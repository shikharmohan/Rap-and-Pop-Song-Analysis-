The Godz must be crazy
I said, the Godz must be crazy
The Godz must be crazy
They said the Godz must be crazy
'Cause I let my hair go wild
Lookin' like a nappy nigga child
Black folk say, "Cut that bush"
Quicker than George Bush, drugs get pushed
They want a nigga clean-cut like the Ancient Greeks
But the Ancient Greeks, were fuckin' freaks
I'm gonna let it grow like a forest
Ain't choppin' shit down, that's why I hear the sound
Some days I wake up mad and I don't feel like hearin' shit
Put all your talkin' to the curb Jack, you don't even know me
Keep thinkin' wild, crush a kid when live, big on stage
At a show, not even fuckin up my cool flow
But this country luck's breakin', there's a war against the righteous
But I got a gun and the God got one
And his man got one and we gon' all be armed
The scope is aimed at the White House and still they say
The Godz must be crazy
The Godz must be crazy
They say the Godz must be crazy
The Godz must be crazy
Nobody do I need, bitch, back up
You think the Godz is trizznippin'?
You flexin', you betta watch yo'self
They say The Godz must be crazy
'Cause I don't bow to the cross
I even had a priest get tossed
Teacher of lies, kept his sword
And when you do, you're gonna praise the Lord
Of all things I could but I don't splurge
Won't submerge myself in material wealth
Just health and well-being through all eye seeing
But eighty-five percent of y'all is disagreeing
See the black man is God and that's an actual fact
But every time I scream it yo I'm under attack
With the crack on my people like a monkey on the back
Bust it in the brain, fuck it if it leave a stain, no pain, no gain
Black Man, change your demeanor
It's gonna be some shit when they unleash FEMA
We're headin' for Armageddon, I'm only spreadin' the facts yo
But since I'm black they say that
The Godz must be crazy
Uh-huh, the Godz must be crazy
They say the Godz must be crazy
The Godz must be crazy
One day I seen a riff, it was three against one
Became three against two 'cause the one man was black
Now three against three 'cause Mark the Spark was with me
Four against three 'cause Daddy-O from Stet was there
Was the odds fair? Have they ever been?
I proceeded with this plan to cut a hole in the grafted man
But then I chilled, I'll wait for the war
Then I can off much more
Skulls on the pavement, bones to bones
Sawed-off, mix it with microphone
Whole blocks filled with pools of blood
Stars and Stripes burned up in the mud
C-Cypher-Punks jump up to get beat down
Play around with the X and get your eye split
We're goin' two to the head Sadat X broke bread
Who said the Godz must be crazy?
