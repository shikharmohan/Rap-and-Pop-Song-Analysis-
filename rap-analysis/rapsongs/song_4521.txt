Yeah
(Chorus)
Up Straight to the top (top)
I just will not stop (stop)
And if they wanna hate just let em ha-a-ate (ha-a-ate)
I spit from the heart (heart), done that from the start (start)
Now look in my eyes and I just cant wa-a-ait (wa-a-ait)
Lil Wayne:
She really rather nice, she put me in her car, she cut off all the lights, she said I have the right to remain silent, now I got a howler, she sounded like a siren
And she know I'm raw, she know I'm from the street, and all she wanted me to do was fuck the police
And after we got done I said lady whats your number and she said 911, haa
and baby said only, headed out the curb for surgery on me
And now I'm here, I make her wear nuttin but hand cuffs and heels
Then I beat it like a cop, Rodney King Baby yea I beat it like a cop, haha, beat it like a cop, Rodney King baby said I beat it like a cop
(Chorus)
Up Straight to the top (top)
I just will not stop (stop)
And if they wanna hate just let em ha-a-ate (ha-a-ate)
I spit from the heart (heart), done that from the start (start)
Now look in my eyes and I just cant wa-a-ait (wa-a-ait)
I grab MC's within my clutch, and crush em.
Now wipe my hand off while opponents stand off, and look sad and unworthy
Im blood thirsty, no mercy, I kill em while they curse me, and damn 49 goin to search me. 
Dont get me started, I flip retarded and start choking artists, Ill leave their kids broken-hearted, fatherless. Im too marvelous, why would you bother this?
Ill squeeze your neck til the slobber drip, so tight, I bite off the bottom lip.
Until your head pop and your soul leave, whoever told you I was holy, Im a killer priest. I see too many wannabees be livin comfortably, southern comfort me. 
Whats the reason why youre frontin me, something like it only took you much to be, personally I take your mentality to mercury. Bring it back to Earth and see the same old check the sons of man lay low. We got 4 minutes to finish.
(Chorus)
Up Straight to the top (top)
I just will not stop (stop)
And if they wanna hate just let em ha-a-ate (ha-a-ate)
I spit from the heart (heart), done that from the start (start)
Now look in my eyes and I just cant wa-a-ait (wa-a-ait)
Gucci Mane:
Girls start choppin, the girls so fine that I put the chick shoppin. Guccis on that old school, smoking on that..fool, know that this a hit, my voice will hit the 4-2's
Gucci mane frightened and I got it like that, never seen a chick with a body like that, shawty acting feisty, too damn shisty. Get with Gucci mane baby youll be so icy.
Cant lie baby girl youre fine as hell, okay, when I hit it on the first day time will tell. Baby say she like the way the top drop back. Never throw my home boy girl a chop like that.
40 on the bracelet, back to the basic, a mill worth of ice in these playa haters faces. Mill worth of ice, Gucci man, good gracious, gotta sick flow, and I think its
(Chorus)
Up Straight to the top (top)
I just will not stop (stop)
And if they wanna hate just let em ha-a-ate (ha-a-ate)
I spit from the heart (heart), done that from the start (start)
Now look in my eyes and I just cant wa-a-ait (wa-a-ait)
