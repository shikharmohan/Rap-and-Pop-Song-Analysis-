Uh, oh, whutcha want, whutcha gon' do nigga
It's the man right Chea
I know ya'll, nigga ain't fuckin' wit me
You lookin' for me
If you gonna be down with me
Be all the way down with me, or get from around me
You see what I'm doin' but don't like it
Even though everybody and their mom's is 'bout it, 'bout it
Our concerts crowded, crowding used to be down
But now you doubt it
You fuckin' playa hatin' cowards! We real over here
We buildin' the No Limit mountain
2 million records and countin', so how the fuck is you soundin'
Nothin' but legends, two multimillionaires rhymin'
Sounds can be astounded, we sellin', ya'll drownin'
Black owned and clownin', CDs across the counter
Told ya'll, I was gonna do it but you didn't wanna see
Wasn't worried about a nigga till I was leavin'
Come here, let me show you the difference between a man and a ho
It's the man right Chea, oh you lookin' for me
Here I go
Whutchu want do nigga
It's the man right Chea
Chastise and brutalizing, stop 'em from dissin'
If I'm in it I own it, put the keys in ignition
I hope your seat belts get fastened, I'm known for massive harassing
Havin' to snatch your ass off the mic, grab ya and slap ya
Psh, come here, psh, shut up
I know you ain't gonna do it no more
You sayin' my name, you must be lookin' for me
Here I go
Whutchu, whutchu want do
Whutchu gonna do
We can do it whenever, however you want to
Entrepreneur soldier guns galore
Watch 'em burn bitch burn like a flame thrower
Rock it all sharp as a bull's horn
Long, strong as a python, whores they get they fight on
Soon as I cut my mic on, niggas getting humped or stumped
Fumbling MCs I crumble, come through like the reaper
So deadly you don't wanna rumble
That's right, don't panic, Mystikal the mechanic
Sank you like a torpedo gigantic as the Titanic
Rhymes I'm hummin' keep hummin', I'ma keep comin'
Grabbin' ya woman but the drummer still drummin'
Hard hitter, bullshitter, head splitter when bitter
Assassinate a rookie killa like Adolph Hitler
A Mandingo warrior, opponents get crushed
I'm too cruel to be moved, too fuckin' much to be touched
Got 'em danglin' and janglin' to that shit when they hear this
Fight me like a Viking, bitch I'm tragic like a terrorist
You think you don't like it but I have yet to begin
You'd rather be my enemy 'cause I'ma deadly friend
So stay the fuck from around me, do I make myself clear
Unless you lookin' for the man
'Cause the man right Chea
