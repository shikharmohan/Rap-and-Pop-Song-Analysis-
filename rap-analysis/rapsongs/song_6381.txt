Now the funeral is over
And all the tears are dried up
Niggas hangin' deep on the cut gettin' fired up
Lookin' for the nigga who pulled his pistol on my homie
An eye for an eye so now your life is what you owe me
Look deep into the eyes of your motherfucking killa
I want you to witness your motherfucking murda nigga
And since you want to kill then your ass has gots to fry
But ain't no police therefore your ass has gots to die
We play the game for keeps and if you slipped I guess you sleep
You showed no fuckin' now your ass is six feet deep
'Cuz where I come from yo everybody's gotta gat
And niggas try your ass just to see where you got your heart at
And if your shit is flimsy then your ass is gonna bend
And like I said before they'll be no tears in the end
I'm rollin' through your hood and now my heart is filled with anger
You at your sister's house now your sister's life's in danger
(By a total stranger)
With tha gang, niggas wanna bang ya
And hang ya, stain ya wit one up in the chamber
Let's take a trip up Holaway
So you can see how many niggas in my hood is down to die today
We standin' up for our own shit
And if you outside the click then you die bitch
(Quick)
It ain't no love in this motherfucker
It ain't no love for yourself or your other brother
Uh because we real with this shit so we stay true
And since we bang then we do what O G say do
I've got the mind of the man in the mirror so I'm lookin' at me vaguely
But I can't seem to fade me, I've got my pistol pawn cocked
Ready ta lay shots nonstop until I see your monkey ass drop
And let your homies know who done it
'Cuz when it comes to this gangsta shit
You motherfuckers know who run it
So when you put this motherfucker to the test
You gotta realize somethin' nigga, you fuckin' wit the very best
I got this killa up inside of me
I can't talk to my mother so I talk to my diary
I'm goin' off on the deep end
I found myself face to face with myself while I'm sleepin'
I see your picture in my head and my hand shake
You can run, you can hide, but there's no escape
My inner feelings show no mercy on my enemy
I got to get this mutherfucker fore he gets to me
So in your own blood you'll bathe
And I won't stop until I put this mutherfucker in his fuckin' grave
And I can say this once again, you can cry but you'll still die
They'll be no tears in the end
