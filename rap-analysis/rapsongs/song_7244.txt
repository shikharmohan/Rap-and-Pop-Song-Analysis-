Don't forget to remember me
Don't forget to remember me
I'll be back so remember me
Please keep me in your mind if we ever have to part
Don't forget to remember me
Ay, the king, modern day Martin Luther, Malcom X
I'm officially the freshest, don't dare to forget
I'm gone momentarily, don't bury me, yeah
Like Ali got, I got that title back, prepare for that
When the world needed to ask where he was at
But when he need somethin' back, fade to black
Talking behind his back, you a hater for that
I don't expect nothin' less in the game of chess
You think 5 moves ahead and not behind
Jumped up, cheered when I got my time
Like yeah, one whole year I got on my grind
But get me losin' off your mind
Shorty, may I remind you that there ain't another
Who done been through what I been through
Time after time again you better get some in you
When you said it was over for him
And you thought he couldn't continue to floss
Here's to your memory loss, sucker
Don't forget to remember me
I'll be back so remember me
Please keep me in your mind if we ever have to part
Don't forget to remember me
They say outta sight is out of mind
And 9 times out of 10, me and out of pocket out of line
You do it big, everybody that you out shined
Then your old lady fate talk 'bout how she got fine
She say she was tryin' to get away, he say about time
Right now we all thinkin', damn hopin' not mine
But when it's lights out for you and you're locked down
Ain't no tellin' whether or not your lady when and got down
With that *** town 'cause he hot now
Rippin' up your love letters, liftin' up her night gown
Right now somebody baby momma gettin' piped down
Kids in the next room listenin', momma pipe down
The thought hurt, don't it? But maybe she's strong enough
Or ain't get that lonely 'cause you wasn't gone long enough
Trump, it's just a temporarily setback
It's on when I get back, please don't forget that
Don't forget to remember me
I'll be back so remember me
Please keep me in your mind if we ever have to part
Don't forget to remember me
I don't mean to feel like this, don't mean to think like this
My heart just has to be sure
That the love that I give to you, that's the love I get from you
I need to be safe and secure
Don't forget to remember me
I'll be back so remember me
Please keep me in your mind if we ever have to part
Don't forget to remember me
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
