Itz that bitch wit that platinum grammy
kill a nigga' for ma' nigga'
by any means bitch, cock the hammer
Little Kim strike a pose and everybody snap they camera
ma' fans range from kids, to the motherfockin grandma!
Oh yess de Queen Bee is back in the game
even though it bin a while, I'm still a household name
rock a ice blue diamond that'll make ya' body shiver
like the Domino's pizza boy, I deliver.
Ya'll jus' mad cos its me they lovin
if your shit is half-baked, then put it back in the oven
See I laugh at'chu hoes try'na come for the crown
WELL C'MON IF U COMIN, COS I AIN'T PLAYIN' AROUND!
Quick like the lone-ranger, gunnin' you down
niggaz I used to look up to, im sunnin' you now
So fuck you, fuck you, and ya motherfocker too ya fuckin faggot! 
I should make ma' niggaz bust off the rappin'
ma' flow you never catch it, gotta' chain I might snatch it
ma' logo leave a imprint and it burn like acid
the L-I, L to the K-I-M
(yeah! yeah! yeah!)
you foolz, you gon' say I am...
Guess whos Bazack! Back on de block
If you niggaz bustin us, we bustin back wit' a glock
when Jake pull up we throw our drugs in the sock
we away for a while that means we buildin our stock
Guess who's Bazack! Back on de block
If you niggaz bustin us, we bustin back wit' a glock
when Jake pull up we throw our drugz in the sock
If we away for a while, that means we choppin' up rocks
(Kim sez a few wordz till fade out)
