Yeah, that's the one
Yo, Thor-El, just just check your mic
So you wanna be the Million Dollar Man, kid, what's your plan?
Make a deal with the Devil, settle for a hundred grand
Not enough, I call your bluff, hit you with the stuff
Deal with this an' think you're tough?
Gimme a call when things get rough
You get no Vette an' if I could stay leaded
I'm leavin' rappers one-legged from fakin' like the prosthetic
More artificial by cripple, rap is like your pistol
Grim Reaper, I got the whistle, death, I pull no tissue
Hit you like the Mac-11, MC's subtract by seven
Callin', callin' for the Reverend, lookin' at Hell like Heaven
I'm on the map, makin' it like the crazy on the track
Oh, what the hell, I get my mail while I raid you 'til it crack
H.I.P.H.O.P., we are
H.I.P.H.O.P., we are
Dead, two in the head before some A an' R tell me
I must give up the streets, you lift the company, can sell me
What's the sense in being large if you can't take a risk?
Thinkin' a risk upon a disc means you're written off the list
I'm not sayin' you can't have your fame an' glory just don't bore me
When I come to see you live an' I paid twenty-five
That's crazy loot Kris is sayin', I don't play those games
'Killing Rhyme Sessions' is the meanin' of my name
But don't call my name in vain 'cause I will appear
An' your livest MC will get slain right here
See, I do the homework an' I do the extra credit
You could sell a million records an' still can't set it
'Cause the Lex or Beem is probably just the matches an' a Jeep
So I'm sure your rap career, now if they come before your people
Oh, Lord, you can't be thinkin' about Billboard
With the mic cord an' several thousand people just bored
Bein' dope live is like bein' insured for life
You always get called back twice, you are
H.I.P.H.O.P., we are
H.I.P.H.O.P., we are
H.I.P.H.O.P., we are
H.I.P.H.O.P., we are
I burn like hydracholoric an' my city got itty
He's terrible, Thor-El's incredible an' terrific
Is it that you're under the influence of local obvious?
Rappers that die, but why? Explain the obvious
No stoppin' this lyrics from the esophagus
Rockin' strictly the hip hop populace
