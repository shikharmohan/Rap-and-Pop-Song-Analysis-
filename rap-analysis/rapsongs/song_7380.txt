[Jazze Pha - Chorus] 
We be pullin' up in the hot shit 
And that's the way to start a show
Now if you gettin' money and got whips (Ladies and gentlemen!) 
Just pull up on your stop 'n' go's 
This is the way we stop and go
Don't block my way, we stop the show 
[Bun B - Verse 1] 
Please rise for the president of the South 
And all hale to the chief wit' them diamond teeth in his mouth 
Make way! 
Big Dick Chaney is 'bout to enter 
King committees in session but first on the agenda 
Bend the corner on them fo's 
'Lac turnin' on them Vouges 
One time for the haters, two times for the hoes 
I suppose it's only right for me to grip up on the cherry
Oak wood wheel while I'm drippin' cranberry 
And very few have acomplished what we have acheived 
Without a rabbit out of a hat, or a trick up his sleeve 
I got a steady hand, and a steady flow 
So on your mark get set (Set), ready go, you already know
[Chorus]
[Pimp C - Verse 2] 
Swishers and dank, and pourin' up big drank 
Hundred thousand dollars in my grown set link 
I got two on that's two hundred
You gon' go crazy nigga tryna count my money 
I came from the bottom they hate me like I'm a Sadam 
One ninety eight in a spur house in Nevada ('Vada 'Vada) 
Vegas nigga got my paper pimpin' through Cerwin Vegas nigga 
Let me show you how we keep the parkin' lot on fire, 
Full kit on my shit twenty six inch tiiiiiires! 
Yokohamas an' the wheel still wood, 
Keep a bad yellow bitch cuz my dick feel good 
When you see us in the hood nigga
[Chorus]
[Jazze Pha - Verse 3] 
Dope man! Yay and the dro in the drought 
Pull up in the spot wit' the brains blowed out 
Wheels cost a whip, whip cost a house 
UGK and Jazze Pha show up and show out 
She wanna chill wit' the crew 
Kick it in the crib on the hill wit' the view 
You know you wanna holla "What it is? What it do?" 
She love me for my old school drops an' my cool 
Cuz my shit be the truth whoa! 
The wheels never pause 
Counterclockwise when I skirrrrrr on 'em all 
And when she fall through an' see the plaques on the wall 
She'll prolly call a couple friends! 
Shit call 'em all, down come the draws 
[Chorus]
