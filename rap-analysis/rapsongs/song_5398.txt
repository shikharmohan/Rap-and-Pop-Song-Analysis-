Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
What you got, boo?
I was in love wit' you, yeah
And you couldn't do no wrong in my eyes
When I found out the scoop on you, yeah
It was still too hard for me to realize
That I needed to be through' wit you, yeah
'Cuz you're the reason I can't eat nor sleep, yeah
All the girls you runnin' through, yeah
Used to be best friends down wit' me, yeah
When I'm gone, you're alone
You stickin' them chickens till I get home
When I'm home, you're wit' me
Kissin' on my ass, tryna be wit' me
Well it's done, this I know
Seen it for myself, I'ma let you know
You don't play, games wit' me
But before I go, betta leave my dough
I'm no fool for you, yeah
But you seem to think my love's a joke
I get no love from you, yeah
Like all these times I did before
I think I'll pass on you, yeah
Because the way you been actin' lately
I get no cash from you, yeah
If you want me to stay, you must be cra-crazy, yeah
When I'm gone, you're alone
You stickin' them chickens till I get home
When I'm home, you're wit' me
Kissin' on my ass, tryna be wit' me
Well it's done, this I know
Seen it for myself, I'ma let you know
You don't play, games wit' me
But before I go, betta leave my dough
Dedication
It was just a bad relation
Feel my pain, it cuts my insides
The tears, they fall deep down from my eyes
Dedication
It was just a bad relation
Feel my pain, it cuts my insides
The tears, they fall deep down from my eyes
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo, doo doo, doo doo, doo doo
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo, doo doo, doo doo, doo doo
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo
I want it al' from the motherfuckin' house, down to the dogs
You trickin' off with these chickens, I thought you ain't have no flaws
Keep yo dick in they jaws, Peter shoulda stayed in his draws
Now I'm out the door and you can't claim me no more, the loss is yours
How you gonna slumber wit' a bitch I'm supposed to be cool wit'
Went to grade school wit', couldn't pay me to believe you hit it to think
I footed all the bills and now you breakin' ?
Stop accusin' me of that dumb shit, I don't even participate in
You wasted my valuable time, there's money to make
Scared to set foot in another relationship, 'cuz of the heartache
Heartbreak hotel, no not faith, Kelly, and Whitney
It's brat, Liyah and Missy you miss me, 'cuz we finished
I'll just keep the keys to the 20 inch rim ride
With the TVs in it ,you don't need it, beat it, it's mine
Used to kiss my ass like your heart was in it
Keep stickin' them chickens
Send Peter straight to the clinic, nigga
See I'ma give you your props tho
You like a bad ass motherfucker
Runnin' two bitches at one time
When I'm flyin' out, she flyin' in
Sayin' the same shit, spinnin' the same game
Who the fuck you think I am?
Willy limp dick or somebody?
Forget you, man
That's why us bitches gonna stick together, bitch
