Hey get your mind right. Stay up out my limelight before I have to do it for ya bro now what that sound like?
No threats just promises, better use your common sense or face the consequences, repercussions and the punishments.
Hey evidently you forgot you dealing wit a parliament, king like Solomon and forces zero tolerance

Dare a god to learn a lesson, kick the ?messit? when I'm in the club stay up out my section.
If you're lookin for your chick well you'll more likely get ejected specially if she half naked and she choosin on the crew.
Grand Hustle in the building, nigga you know what it do like, like yeah...
