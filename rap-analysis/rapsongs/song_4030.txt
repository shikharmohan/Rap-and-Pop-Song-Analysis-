I did a lot, I know you say I've got to get away. "The world is not yours for the taking" Is all you ever say. I know I'm not the best for you, But promise that you'll stay. 'Cause if I watch you go, You'll see me wasting, you'll see me wasting away 'Cause today, you walked out of my life 'Cause today, your words felt like a knife I'm not living this life. Goodbyes are meant for lonely people standing in the rain And no matter where I go it's always pouring all the same. These streets are filled with memories Both good for detected pain And all I wanna do is love you But I'm the only one to blame. 'Cause today, you walked out of my life 'Cause today, your words felt like a knife I'm not living this life. But what do I know, if you're leaving All you did was stop the bleeding. But these scars will stay forever, These scars will stay forever And these words have no meaning If we cannot find the feeling That we held on to together Try your hardest to remember
