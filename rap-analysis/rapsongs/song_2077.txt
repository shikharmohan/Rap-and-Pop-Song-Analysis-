[Dr. Dre/Snoop Dogg] 
As the wheels turn city to city, hundreds fold, chronic smoke 
Twist up another philly (dun dilly) 
Them niggas still trippin off that old shit (really?) how silly 
It's a whole 'nother day (yeah yeah) Snoop Dogg (and Doc motherfuckin Dre) 
Nigga can ya feel this? 
It's the D-O-double, you don't run up, you won't see no trouble 
If you caught up in these fuckin streets 
Who you gon' call when them niggas gettin ready to blast? 
Yeah, and if that shit's gettin ugly 
Who you gon' call when them niggas come to gettin ya ass?(I came to get that ass!) 
Big dittog, push the big hittog 
Ya hoppin and poppin, how bout you hop up off my bittalls 
Got(GOT) dirt on my pittaws 
I(I) broke a few littaws 
It(IT) really don't matter cause I'm only here to spit on 
And get on, shit on niggas 
Do it to 'em D-O-double right on nigga 
I'm saggin it, baggin it, slang them Dubs 
You motherfuckers think The Wash is all soap and suds, whassup 'cause? 
If you tryin to get a dub sack, page me 
The ho's say "D-Loc, you so crazy" 
Poppin that shit don't phase me 
I need my chips and the dip it's like gravy 
Now back to the lecture at hand 
Perfection is expected and I'm feelin that demand 
Los Ang, broad day gunnin 
That ain't no earthquake it's just Dre comin 
If this shit ain't played, the party ain't bumpin 
If I don't show up, the ho's ain't fuckin 
Cali sunshine, come visit 
Just don't stop at stop signs with bullet holes in it 
All Star league, you writin Benjamins 
I handles my business, FUCK fake niggas 
I sell game a quarter million a track 
Snoop and the good Doc back with a brand new sack 
Shit's wrong, money gone, I blast 
Out of town, out of bounds, no pass 
Runnin up, talkin shit, get smashed 
Shoot first, ask questions last 
Fallin back on that ass, hit the switch and let the ass just drag(zzzt zzt) 
2001, 2002 Taz 
My nigga what you holdin? 
Step out with the Stacy's and the Snoop Dogg clothing 
Rollin, with the braids in my hair 
Crimped out, way pimped out, OH YEAH 
You gots to pay the cost to beat the boss 
After all that dirt I gots to get my shit washed 
The Wash
