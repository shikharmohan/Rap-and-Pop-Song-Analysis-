Hip hop hooray ho, hey, ho, hey, ho, hey, ho
You drew a picture of my morning
But you couldn't make my day, hey
I'm rockin' and you're yawning
But you never look my way, hey
I'm lickin' down you darlin'
In every single way, hey
Your funny flow is foreign
And a Green Card's on the way
This ain't got shit to do wit shampoo
But watch your Head & Shoulders
Brother older bold enough to fold ya I told ya
A raid afraid of what I made of played
Plus a funky fit so save ya flips
Plus tricks for that music in the monkey bit
Triggas from the grill town ill town some ask how it feels now
The deal is that we're real so we're still around
Don't lamp wit a freestyle phantom ain't tryin' to be handsome
Shrinkin' what ya thinkin' 'cause I'm vampin'
I live and die for hip hop
This is hip hop for today
I give props to hip hop
So hip hop hooray, ho, hey, ho, hey, ho, hey, ho
Hip hop hooray, ho, hey, ho, hey, ho, hey, ho
You heard a lot about a brother gaining mo' ground
Being low down I do the showdown wit' any little ho round, no
I wanna know who you're believing through you're funny reasons
Even when I'm sleeping you think I'm cheatin'
You said, "I know you're Mr. O P P man"
Yo PP Man won't only see me man
You should've known when I hid in the step
There I was waited a bit and I consider the rep heck
I did your partner 'cause she's hot as a baker
'Cause I'm Naughty By Nature not 'cause I hate cha
You put your heart in a part of a part that spreads apart
And forgot that I forgave ya when you had a spark
You try to act like something really big is missing
Even though my name's Graffiti written on your kitten
I love black women always and disrespect ain't the way
Let's start a family today
Hip hop hooray, ho, hey, ho, hey, ho, hey, ho
Hip hop hooray, ho, hey, ho, hey, ho, hey, ho
Hip hop hip hip hop hip hip hop hooray
There's many hungry hip hoppers
One reason hip hop's tip top today
'Cause I ain't bailing no hey ain't choppin' no crops
But still grownin' ever day
Here's a thunder sound from the wonders found
From the underground town down the hill
Feel how ill town drown smiles to frowns
Snatchin' crowns from clowns beat downs are found
Don't know me don't come around
Tippy tippy pause, tippy tippy pause
Sometimes creepin' up I eat em up
Your style is older than Lou Rawls
Peace to this one and that one and them
That way I shout out and I didn't miss one friend
Fools get foolish neither them or Parker Loose Lewis
You could have crews wit shoes and can't step to us
Some kitty purr I call 'em sir too looking for her crew
Any trick that this gets a curfew
I put my projects for boots step through troops and leave proof
My problem solvers name is Mook
I hittin' woodys in a hoody, peace to Jesette, Joete, Jo Jo, Gene
And every hood gee, that's right my fight is ill
Peace goes to L.O.N.S. and quest, nice and smooth and Cypress Hill
I live and die for hip hop, this is hip hop of today
I give props to hip hop
So hip hop hooray, ho, hey, ho, hey, ho, hey, ho
Hip hop hooray, ho, hey, ho, hey, ho, hey, ho
Smooth it out now
Now
Now
