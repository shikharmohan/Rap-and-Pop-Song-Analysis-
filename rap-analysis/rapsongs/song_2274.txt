I'm sittin' here writin' a song about
Baby'z mothers who try to sue the daddies for child support
Even though daddy is takin' care of the baby
But the mother's just, you know, scandalous, not just like this hey
Fuck my baby'z mama the bitch got drama
Fuck my baby'z mama 'coz she's the type o' bitch
That wanna see me broke, broker than a joke, bitch stole my role
And every time I see the bitch she needs cash
She make me wanna slap her ass triflin' bitch always got me in a fit
The low life Compton shoppin' swap me trick
I wanna kill the ho then slam her in the trunk of my six fo'
'Coz yo, that ho made my dick grow and now her lawyer's at every show
Waitin' for me to kick in my dough
But before I go I'm on death row
'Coz the bitch had too much drama.
Fuck my baby'z mama
Fuck my baby'z mama
Fuck my baby'z mama
Fuck my baby'z mama
Fuck my baby'z mama
Fuck my baby'z mama
Fuck my baby'z mama
Fuck my baby'z mama
(Trick bitch)
Fuck my baby'z mama
Fuck my baby'z mama the bitch got drama
And I'm not the one, I should just knock her punk ass out
While I'm in court payin' child support
But then I gotta deal with the father and the steel
And he's the type o' nigga that a nigga's gotta kill
Make me kick up a grip, I don't like her
'Coz the bitch is buyin skirts instead of diapers
Beggin' so much to hold hands it's startin to look like cuffs
I wish I never fucked but now it's too late
How much you made? 'Coz accordin' to your income
You might have to spend some time behind bars
Now ya find it hard
Never thought a bitch would pull a stunt like this
I can't do another day with Pamela
So I'm a pay ya, Anna but I just like to say
Fuck my baby'z mama
Fuck my baby'z mama
Fuck my baby'z mama
Fuck my baby'z mama
Fuck my baby'z mama
Fuck my baby'z mama
Fuck my baby'z mama
(Trick bitch)
Fuck my baby'z mama
I think of all the money that I spent on a lawyer
I used to be an employer
But now I'm just an employee filin' bankruptcy
But now the punk bitch can't touch me
Huh, I only call her to check up on my daughter
So now she's got a restraining order
Put me to the curb and had the nerve to ask a bower or dime
Bitch, you must be outcha rabid ass mind
Huh, love for start will take much, you see, the bitch broke me
So now I need a crutch
But you gotta understand a judge don't give a fuck
About a young nigga that's down on his luck
So I gotta put the P down and be down for the calls
And give the bitch back her drawers
So if ya drivin' by and ya see her
Do me favor, give the bitch the finger, fuck her
Fuck my baby'z mama
Fuck my baby'z mama
Fuck my baby'z mama
Fuck my baby'z mama
Fuck my baby'z mama
Fuck my baby'z mama
Fuck my baby'z mama
(Trick bitch)
Fuck my baby'z mama
