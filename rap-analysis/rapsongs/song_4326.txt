Lil Wayne: 
Shawty a dime
shawty a crime
'Cause she be killing them everytime
Shawty shop online, she stay at the salon.
But how she stick in my head
how she stick in my mind
shawty so so fine
that im not fine no im not well
this must be hell
Cause shorty were my angel
and i lost my angel
i should be single for being single.
What am i doin
where am i going
what didnt i do
what wasnt i showing
what wasnt i knowing
that you not knowing
because of you and him me and her not growing.
shit is not going the way that its supposed to she tell me every night she wish she woulda came before you.
i tell her everyday i wish she coulda came before you.
But we live in a world where wishes dont come true.
Chorus:
Damn i love you(damn i love you)
So much that i hate you(so much that i hate you)
But i hate that i love you(i hate that i love you)
I wish that i could hate you(i wish that i could hate you)
But damn i love you(damn i love you)
so much that i hate you(so much that i hate you)
I hate that i love you(i hate that i love you)
