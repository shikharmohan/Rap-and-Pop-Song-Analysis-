[Lil' Wayne:]
Okay, My Leather So Soft But Don't Think I Ain't Hard
Bitch Say Weezy Make It Rain, I Say Bitch I Ain't God
But I Am God's Son, But You Know I Ain't Nas
See, He Got A Positive Aim, And I Aim Nines
Man, Little Weezy Got A Style That Even I Can't Find
Man, Some Shit Just Be So Hard, I Be Like That Line Ain't Mine
And If That Is Under A Gram, Then That Line Ain't Mine
And If You Niggas Talking War, Well Bitch, It's Combat Time
Hey, I Take Three L's To The Head: Love, Live, Life, And I'm Dead
Young Money, Dipset, That's What This Is
And If I Ain't Good Looking, You Can Bet My Bitch Is
I Done Made It Off Apple Street Like It Was 2300 Jackson Street
Young Money, Can't Join 'em Nor Beat 'em
Where The Fuck Is Robin Leech When You Need Him?
A Rich Nigga Can't Even Buy Freedom
That's Why I Give My White Bitches Everything But Freedom
I Do My White Bitches Anything But Beat 'em
And If They Like Rat Poison, Then I'ma Feed 'em
I'm Sophisticated, Fresh From Antarctica My Wrist Just Made It
I'm Rich Bitch, I Ain't Broke No More
But I Will Still Chop You Up And Feed Your Ass To The Poor
I'm 'bout My Cream Like A S'more
You Old Ass Rappers Better Stay On Tour
You're Like 44, I Got A 44, I'm 24
I Could Murk You And Come Home When I'm 44
[Chorus:]
