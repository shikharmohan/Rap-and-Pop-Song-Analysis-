To the tic toc, ya don't stop
To the beat, beat, ya don't quit, shit
To the tic toc, ya don't stop
To the beat, beat, ya don't quit
Before the sun shines the rain falls
Applause the encore
Haven't you heard of a bitch who get open like pores
Pop a nigga like a pimple keep it simple enough
Make 'em wonder what the fuck happened leavin' 'em stuffed
Get that ass kicked fast quick in a hurry
You felt the fist of fury when you envisioned that I was comin'
Used to laugh when I had a demo
But since the big stretch Lex Limo
You ain't got no more jokes
Ya wanna come on and go with me
To my place hate to hurt ya feelings sexual healin' ain't the case
Laced the tracks like Angle dust, fuckin' wit us is deadly
Behead the whole crew of the last nigga who was'nt ready
Stay bregheted up, platinum plus
Nubians-e three four chrome's 18's three piece B B's treat seat's
And y'all shall find riches it's mad bitches gettin' dough
I'll die for I go broke just a lil' more
Just a lil' bit more
Just a lil' bit more
Do me just a uhh
Just a lil' bit more will ease my mind
Just a lil' bit more
Just a lil' bit more
Do me just a uhh
Just a lil' bit more will ease my mind
Now put one hand in the air if ya keep the chinky out effect
I live to party all night and love to have sex
Got a main squeeze in the piece on the low
Make a good piece of cheese but could use some more
Who got a lighter 'bout to blaze up it's tucked in tight
I let the ventilation slide sensation between the wind pipe
Ignite it up try to bite my style too tought
Its too much , too lil', too late for you to come up
Be decieved if ya wanna be foolish this bad mandate bitch is
True to the shit,envoke the spirits like the craft's
Serve the niggas half the stash in case the cash get low
The bastard know
Fuck over the dough and die
Pick yo casket if you feel that you gone try some shit
No nigga ever lasted past the first attempt
I leave 'em baffled and gaffle 'em for all of they keys
Then dispence to my niggas like sony distributing LP's
Just a lil' bit more
Just a lil' bit more
Do me just a uhh
Just a lil' bit more will ease my mind
Just a lil' bit more
Just a lil' bit more
Do me just a uhh
Just a lil' bit more will ease my mind
To the tic toc, ya don't stop
To the beat, beat, ya don't quit shit
To the tic toc, ya don't stop
To the beat, beat, ya don't quit
Just a lil' bit more
Just a lil' bit more
Do me just a uhh
Just a lil' bit more will ease my mind
Just a lil' bit more
Just a lil' bit more
Do me just a uhh
Just a lil' bit more will ease my mind
That'll ease your mutha-phuckin' mind yeah
So, so def with that mind blowin' shit
