She said she's never done it, she said she's never tried
She's sittin' there tellin' a motherfuckin' lie
She said she's never done it, she said she's never tried
She's sittin' there tellin' a motherfuckin' lie
She said she was a Christian and she grew up in the church
Would stay a virgin if for better or for worse
Had plenty friends and got offers all the time
Swore up and down she was just one of a kind
She said she's loved, but she's never gotten pimped
Not dominated couldn't imagine, never dream
And though she steady lookin' for the perfect man
To buy a ring and take her motherfuckin' hand, man
She said she's never done it, she said she's never tried
She's sittin' there tellin' a motherfuckin' lie
She said she's never done it, she said she's never tried
She's sittin' there tellin' a motherfuckin' lie
She said her stuff was sacred, and her momma told her so
And that she went and got it pierced on the low
Can you believe she's been waitin' for so long?
To get a grade a certified shlong
She said her parents never let her out the house
Because they knew it was so dirty in the South
She hates to boast and you know she hates to brag
But, man I gotta let her cut up out the bag, and
She said she's never done it, she said she's never tried
She's sittin' there tellin' a motherfuckin' lie
She said she's never done it, she said she's never tried
She's sittin' there tellin' a motherfuckin' lie
She said she never tried to take it in the butt
But, knew some ho down all around sluts
She even said she's never licked another girl
And never had any chocolate, vanilla swirl
She said that ring up in her tongue was for show
And she would never be mistaken for a hoe
She's tellin' lies over 20 years old
I guess the game is to be sold, not told
She said she's never done it, she said she's never tried
She's sittin' there tellin' a motherfuckin' lie
She said she's never done it, she said she's never tried
She's sittin' there tellin' a motherfuckin' lie
She said she had a nigga who was only there for rent
And wouldn't shake her booty for a red cent
She said she never fucked 3 niggas at a time
Till lil' Fate started fuckin' with her mind
She said she couldn't see how women turn tricks
And couldn't picture tryna suck a nigga dick
She had respect, and wouldn't do nothin' wrong
But, she the reason why we made this song
She said she's never done it, she said she's never tried
She's sittin' there tellin' a motherfuckin' lie
She said she's never done it, she said she's never tried
She's sittin' there tellin' a motherfuckin' lie
She said she's never done it, she said she's never tried
She's sittin' there tellin' a motherfuckin' lie
She said she's never done it, she said she's never tried
She's sittin' there tellin' a motherfuckin' lie
She said she's never done it
She said she's never done it
She said she's never done it
She said she's never done it
She said she's never done it
She said she's never done it
She said she's never done it
She said she's never done it
