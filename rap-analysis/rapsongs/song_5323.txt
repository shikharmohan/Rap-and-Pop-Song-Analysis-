It's the beat, he hear it in his sleep sometime
Blare it in your jeep so your peoples can stare at them rhymes
Real rhymes, not your everyday hologram
Even when ribs were touchin' never swallowed the ham
He'd rather eat a sand sandwich salad
It might need salt like your man's bland ballad
A lot of stuff happens that the news won't tell you's
Loose all L juice, snooze all hell loose
Rake it, take it like the good, the bad, the ugly
Break it rollin' through your hood in the caddy buggy
Butter softy, leather flossy, fatty juggy
Always threw me off when she told me, "Daddy, funk me"
I'm like anywho's
Seeds walkin' all out in street without any shoes
I guess it's better than some funky socks
You need to get her some skips before she catch the monkey pocks
Instead she wants to hear the beatbox
Take pills and make fake krills as sheetrock
Sing it, bring it back to your laboratory
While he's in his oratory, glorious like a horror story
The mask is like Jason
They told the place not to let the basket type case in
He could be some kind of wacko
Waiting for the chance to heat the pipes like a crack hoe
He busted in, blessed be the Lord
Who believe any mess then read up on the message board
If so I got bridges for the low, low
Same bitch a go dry snitchin' to the popo
Yeah, orange peal stoges for the hotel
Feel like I have been gone over a year, came home to old gear
It was the shit when I first scooped it
At least I get to sit out in New York and curse, stupid
Plead the fifth, sip wine stiffly
Patiently come up and be spiffy in a jiffy
Gift for the grind, criminal mind shifty
Swift with the nine through a fifty nine fifty
Well edjumacated, he heard it when he meditated
In deep data, had her hate the Greek plata
Dedicated cheap skater who keeps data
Sage stays self medicated and sleep later
Side effects is similar to sugar pill
Whoever go next on the mic he put a bugger ill
And made his exit on some calm shit
Begged him on the regular for kegs of more vomitspit
