Chorus
Girls you know you'd- better, watch out (Watch out!) 
Some guys, some guys are only about (About!) 
That thing, that thing, that thing! (Thing!) 
That thing, that thing, that thing! (Thing!) 
Throw your hands in the air! 
Admit two shots in the atmosphere! 
Verse 1
It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend 
The one you let hit it and never called you again 
Remember when he told you he was about the benjamins? 
You act like you ain't here him, but gave him a little trim 
To begin, how you think you're really going to pretend 
Like you wasn't down and you called him again? 
Plus when, you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him 
If you did it then, then you'd probably do it again 
Talking out your neck, saying you're a Christian 
A Muslim, sleeping with the Gin 
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in 
Who're you going to tell when the repercussions spin? 
Showing off your a-- because your thinking it's a trend 
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again! 
You know I only say it because i'm truly genuine 
Don't be a hard rock, when you really are a gem 
Baby girl! Respect is just the minimum 
brothas creepin' and you still defending him 
Now -- Lauryn is only human 
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament 
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly been 
It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in 
Look at what you be in, hair weaves like Europeans 
Fake nails up out Koreans 
Come again 
Yo! A-When when come again! (Yeah-Yeah!) 
When when come again!! (Yeah-Yeah!) 
My friend come again!!! (Yeah-Yeah!) 
Chorus
Guys you know you'd better, watch out (Watch out!) 
Some girls, some girls are only, about (About!) 
That thing, that thing, that thing! (Thing!) 
That thing, that thing, that thing! (Thing!) 
Verse 2
The second verse is dedicated to the men 
More concerned with his rims and his Tim's than his women 
Him and his men, come in the club like houligans 
Don't care who they offend 
Popping game (Like you got yen!) 
Let's stop pretend, the ones that pissed out by they waste men 
Cristall by the case men, still living in his Mother's basement 
The pretty face men claiming that they be the "big men." 
Need to take care of their three and four kids 
But they face a court case when the child support's late 
Money taking and heart breaking 
Now you wonder why women hate men 
The sleepy silent men 
The punk domestic violence men 
Quick to shoot the scene, stop acting like boys and be men! 
How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?! 
How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?! 
How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?! 
Unh-Unhh Come Again! 
Bro-Straight come again! 
Sit straight come again! 
Watch out, watch out 
Look out, look out 
Watch out, watch out 
Look out, look out 
Watch out, watch out 
Look out, look out 
Watch out, watch out 
Look out, look out
