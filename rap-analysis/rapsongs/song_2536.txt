Yo check this out, man we're gonna do this
Man we got 2 minutes and 20 seconds to get in and out of there
Yo, Redman, solo, man don't get in there and start frontin' man
Hit the vault, get the cash, don't shoot nobody, alright?
Tom, set the detonators, we 'bout to do this shit P let's do this now
Freeze hands in the air nobody move
Mack-10 is packed, so don't break fool
This is a stick-up, real deal, real steel
Full cooperation and no one gets killed
Hey security old man, don't play hero
'Cuz a hero is a dead man and a dead man is a zero
Yo, hoe put that loot in the money sack
You reach for the button and then you gettin' smacked
Crack the vault you stutter, mothafucka?
One more dumb move, P and I'm-a buck her
Chill, E listen lady, can't afford to do time
One more slip up and your ass is mine
I need all keys and codes to security boxes
CD's, jewels, plus money markets
Chill before I bulk like the hulk, Bruce Banner
Yo Redman solo what where the cameras
All men, women and children please hit the floor
Where I'll be, D-Wade, watch the back door
Time to get scratch, bring around the 560
Time check, a minute and fifty
Time keeps on slippin' slippin'
Come on, P, man, ya bullshittin'
Hurry up, grab the sack and let's do this
Pray for the Benz and haul ass like Carl Lewis
A reminder, a heroes nothin' but a sandwich gus
This is ridiculous, you say another word
I'll make ya famous, I feel like bustin' lose
P's been hit, ow a sharpshooter on the roof
Aw shit, yo Redman, keep the money movin'
Yo Tom J, if I ain't out of here in 10 seconds
Blow this mothafucker up and everybody, ya hear me?
You got 15 seconds to put your weapons down
And come out with your hands up
15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2
Let it go, 1, yo we outta here
