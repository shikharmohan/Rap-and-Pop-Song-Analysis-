||Verse 2||
Bitch im Mack Maine
I got tha heart of a king, blood of a slave
feel like i been there before, my second time to the grave
but its one life to live, thats why im gettin paid
off a flow thats priceless, i just got it appraised
spit like i need a raise
blaze as i gaze, at the stars and ask the lord 
why the culprit at the pall pit
it make me sick to my stomach
thats why i rap, like a pregnant woman i dont spit i vomit
so pay homage me and wayne two G's
like twenty hundreds
and we keep the semi's blunted
and we live like brothas from anotha
so f**k with him and mack gonna react like you did me something
thats a hint to you David
throwin shots at Goliath 
this the new testament, where the victor is tha giant
so you should get your way and lose the hate
remember males shouldn't be jealous, thats a females trait
||Chorus||
Future(I know)
Future(I know) 
Future(I know)

Future(I know) 
Future(I know) 
Future(I know) 
Future(I know) 
Future(I know) 
Future(I know) 
Future(I know) 
Future(I know they cant f**k with me cuz im da center of tha world)
