Get your drank on, get your smoke on
Get your dance on, skin tight pants on
Get your party on, get your holla on
Doogie-dance, lil' mama, get your party on
Get your groove on, get your yak on
If you game tight, playa, get your mack on
Get your thug on, get your buzz on
But don't forget we livin' in a warzone
Bouncers actin' like cops in the club
Mother fuck around and get dropped in the club
They don't play enough 2Pac in the club

Whole lotta dro gettin' passed in the club
But them cameras got the zone blasted in the club

Get your drank on, get your smoke on
Get your dance on, skin tight pants on
Get your party on, get your holla on
Doogie-dance, lil' mama, get your party on
Get your groove on, get your yak on

Forget about the world outside in the club
You can run but you can't hide in the club
Dance to the government lies in the club
Fuck that, party all night in the club
Still dames got no rights in the club
Party by the disco lights in the club
We spend a lotta cash in the club

Everybody's girlfriend's eating in the club
Everybody's boyfriend's eating in the club
Niggaz got a shank in a boot in the club [unverified]
Ready to cut a secret ID from the hands in the club [unverified]
Like what is corrupt in the club niggaz buy weed in the club
Crackers buy coke in the club
Get high in the club then die in the club
But they gotta bring identify in the club
If you see me in the club give a pound and a hug
Show love I'm just another thug in the club
But you can't rub me the wrong way
We can get it one, sho nuff, in the club
We can take it out in the club what's it all about, nigga what?
Why the fuck I came in the club get fucked up in the club
Loose a lot of blood in the club why the fuck I came in the club?
Get your drank on, get your smoke on
Get your dance on, skin tight pants on
Get your party on, get your holla on
Doogie-dance, lil' mama, get your party on
Get your groove on, get your yak on
If you game tight, playa, get your mack on
Get your thug on, get your buzz on
But don't forget we livin' in a warzone
