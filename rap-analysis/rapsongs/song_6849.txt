Yeh bitch I got my now and later gators on
I'm 'bout to show you how my pimp hand is way strong
You dead wrong if you think the pimpin gon' die
12 piece with a 100 hoes by my side
I'm down with that nigga 50 like I'm down with blue
Fuck Cu's, nah nigga motherfuck you
G-U-N-I-Tizzee, fuckin with me and the D-P-Gizzee 
Niggas in New York know how Doggie get down
I got my niggas in Queens, i got my bitches uptown
I got my business in Manhattan, I aint fuckin around
And got some butter pecan Puerto Ricans, from the boogie down (down)
That's waitin on me to return, 
So they can snatch these braids out and put my shit in a perm (word word)
They love it when I get to Crippin
And spittin this magni-gni-ficent pimpin
I don't know what you heard about me 
But a bitch can't get a blunt up outta me
I drive a Cadillac, wear a perm and I'm a G
'cause I'm a motherfuckin P-I-M-P
I don't know what you heard about me 
But a bitch can't get a crumb up outta me
I drive a Cadillac, wear a perm cause I'm a G
'cause I'm a motherfuckin P-I-M-P
(50 Cent)
It's G-Unit and the DPG
From New York City to the LBC
I break it down for you I'm a P-I-M-P
When my gun go off nigga ask about me
Nigga look what dun' happen since your bitch dun' chose
My wrist dun' froze I'll show you how I get them hoes
I'll spit that G that be fuckin with their brain
Have 'em on a track when it's freezing in the rain
Scream on a bitch with the nerve to complain
Like bitch you dead wrong
If you catch a date you be warned
You said you want the finer things in life
You gotta go out and get it
And I'll be right here waiting when you come back with it 
You see I was born to break a bitch
My instructions to make a bitch
I got me a New York Knicks, Celtics, and a Laker bitch
I got that G that make these hoes have a change of heart
I'm a natural I've been good at this from the start
(Snoop)
I don't know what you heard about me 
But a bitch can't get a blunt up outta me
I drive a Cadillac, wear a perm and I'm a G
'cause I'm a motherfuckin P-I-M-P
I don't know what you've heard about me 
But a bitch can't get a crumb up outta me
I drive a Cadillac, wear a perm cause I'm a G
'cause I'm a motherfuckin P-I-M-P
Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo

It's goin down now with 50, and big Snoop Dogg, and the Arch Bishop Don Magic Juan riding shotgun with Whoo Kidd, the straight up pimp. It's crack-a -lackin. 
It's pimps up, you know it's hoes down. It's green for the money, gold for the honey. 
We off and we runnin' with 50 and Snoop Dogg and the Mackalennium. 
Keep it down playa. Pimps up, you know the rest. Check.
