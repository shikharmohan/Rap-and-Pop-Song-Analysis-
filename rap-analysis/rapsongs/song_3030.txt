Ayyo, Water's back, quarterback, thought of as a fat cat
I brought her that, slaughter that, trust that, I rush dat
Don divas dice game fevers and up
Malibu Sea Breeze in the cup, what what?
D the Dean, D the Don, Waterbed dot com
Perignon Dom, hotter than Prada, hot now
Hotter tomorrow, hot as Nevada
Las Vegas, lost wages then I shook it off
Strip club why don'tcha take it off and then I break 'em off?

Toss Cognac, the boss on dat, spit semi-'matic
Pimp habits, mack status, black fabric
Black magic, rap magic, rap logic, Diggy got it
Check, D, on CD, now you fiend me
Big screen TV, now you see me, plush livin'
Touch women, phenomenal flow
Bahamas with a momma to go, fantastic
Money stretch like elastic, wreak havoc
Chicks who speak Arabic, Latin and such
With the satin to touch
They brag about us, mad about us
We toss it up, come on
You nasty Hev, you nasty

Black Rover, black Casanova, black on black Benz
Black upholstered, black chauffeur with a black holster
And chrome burner, head turner, head getter
Who better, new cheddar, handlin', chain danglin'
New York to England, it's D again, they diggin' me again
See me win again, hot like sun, bust like gun
Crush like Pun, rush this one, trust me son
They lust this one, that's why they come
Dame hitter, pretty thug nigga, flame spitter
Many loved by nigga, popular figure, stop 'em with glitter
Shock 'em with heat, rockin your Jeep
Rock 'em to sleep, Diggy unique, y'all hear me speak?
