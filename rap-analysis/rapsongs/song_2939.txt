First I loved God, then loved my mother
Love my babies, sisters and brothers
Love my father 'cos that's my mom's partner
Love my grandmother and my grouchy assed grandfather
Love my aunties on both sides of the family
Uncles, cousins, nieces and nephews
Mess with my peoples you get stepped to
Love the mother of my children, them girls is special
Love feels good though we stuck in the hood
Love my last album, though the joint went wood
My mans and my enemies, I love them too
Love God he let me see passed 32
Plus what he gave Wu, I chance to change music
Just listen, you and I know the truth
Love is essential, to some it's detrimental
Most of you would've use the next person as a rental
Love, lift us up, take us higher
Blossom every ghetto flower
'Cos love, only love has that healing power
And we could never live without it, no
Love life, the ground we walk on
My sickness, it made me strong
My loved ones in Heaven
The ones we lost to heroin
Malcolm, Martin, and what they still for, the men had it poppin'
Love the sun when rain drops in
Cosy night with mom punk in
Love the hell and my struggle
You gotta go through Hell to come out right
Love conquers pain and the puzzle
Funny on how love could end so subtle
Was it just sex and not really love for the couple?
Love people, love the fact when there's a baby bein' born
Like "Push girl, come on"
I'm not just sayin' that 'cos BET's on
We is one, one love, each one, teach one
Love, lift us up, take us higher
Blossom every ghetto flower
'Cos love, only love has that healing power
And we could never live without it, no
Love, lift us up, take us higher
Blossom every ghetto flower
'Cos love, only love has that healing power
And we could never live without it, no
Love, lift us up, take us higher
Blossom every ghetto flower
Love, only love has that healing power
And we could never live without it, no
Love
