You ain't that tough ya
Choose the right friends
You ain't that tough now
Don't make your life end
Come with it
You walk around the town like you a big man
But you never know now that there's always a bigger man
You sling the M-16 and flash the M-1
But you don't know what you're doing, never learned to handle one
But true, all you friend thinking you a gangster
While your mother tried to warn you from certain danger
So when you in your room, you're playing with your Mac-10
Fully loaded automatic, just you and a friend
You're posing aw dey mirror like you a gangster clown
But the Mac-10 go off and your friend go down
Uh oh, what you gonna do now?
Uh oh, they gonna blame you somehow
Uh oh, tell me what you gonna say
Uh oh, look, them cutting you away
Come with it
Your father telling you "Now son just go to school
Don't go acting like no fool and don't go acting too cool"
You get to the school, meet up with the right bunch
Just a group of kids with no names taking people lunch
You join the click because you wanna meet some girls
And you want a little prestige in your little school world
One day you're walking with your crew along the road
And a member of your crew pull out a gun and unload
Him shoot a parked car and all you run far
You and your friends laughing like you a superstar
You get home and you thinking it was fresh
And a cop meet you there with a warrant for your arrest
Them ask, "Who shot the gun while you walking down the street?
Didn't you see the little boy there in the back seat sleep?
Now the boy dead, we want to know from you
Who shot the car up, are we gonna take you?"
Uh oh, now what you gonna do now?
Uh oh, boy, them gonna blame you
Uh oh, now tell me what you gonna say
Uh oh, look, them cutting you away
Come with it
You ain't that tough ya
Choose the right friends
You ain't that tough ya
Don't make your life end
Come with it
White kids, you living in the whitest part of town
You are a white kid but you know, you hang around
So you and your friends thinking that you are all that
When you see a youth walk by and yes the youth is black
One kid say "Hey, what you doing on the block
We don't want no niggers here unless he is a cop"
So the kid pull out a big baseball bat
And them slap him with the bat just because the kid was black
Now the kid fell down but still alive
So he reach in his pants and pulled out a four-five
Pop, one friend drop and everyone run
Out of all the white kids now you the only one
You start cry 'cause now you gonna die
And it's all because what your friends did to this guy
Uh oh, what you gonna do now?
Uh oh, he gonna blame you somehow
Uh oh, what you think you gonna say?
Uh oh, now them cutting you away, check
Come with it
You ain't that tough now
Choose the right friends
You ain't that tough now
Don't make your life end
Come with it
You ain't that tough now
Choose the right friends
You ain't that tough now
Don't make your life end
