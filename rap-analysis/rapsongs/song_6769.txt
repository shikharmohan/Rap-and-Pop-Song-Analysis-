It's the same story, a *** rich
I'm on some *** ***, and yo' ***, ***
You better check him, tell him I'm off the chain
I buck and bang, homie that's on the gang
Oh, I ain't got a problem, you see me gettin' staxxx
You see I bought the Phantom, 24's don't come with that
I've been around the world, check grip in every state
Yo' *** don't like me, she fake, some people might call it hate
But I don't give a damn, a bosses life is how I make that bread
Toss the mic and I'll still be richer than rich
And have yo' *** make my bed
My pockets fat as ***, you *** mad as ***
Pumps 'Neither One Of Us', I'm on some Gladys ***
Many have tried and failed, *** I'm out on bail
I make more cheese than your old man and he went to Yale
*** I went to jail, you can go to hell
You got some *** to tell? I got some *** for sale
I got staxxx in my jeans, Phantom up in my garage

Candypaint drippin', look at all them bags
Had to show and brag 'cause bein' broke's a drag
I gotta get this paper, my kids they gotta eat
We got a lot of heat, just case them dollars cease
Been out for ballin', shot callin' I make that change
And I don't want the Range, chop that trey on thangs
That's how them gangstas do it, we get our green in bricks
We put our green in ***, you spend your green on chicks
I'm on some player ***, dynasty, straight Laker ***
Cook it up on some baker *** and chop it up for some paper ***
I got my mind right and my money right
If you ain't in the game for the money you the funny type
And I'm laughin' my ass off, Phantom with the mask off
Legal so they hatin' when I gas off
You know how Snoopy does it, Phantom don't *** touch it
One hundred thousand a show, I'm gettin' dough like *** it
I got staxxx in my jeans, Phantom up in my garage
I got staxxx in my jeans, Phantom up in my garage
I got staxxx in my jeans, Phantom up in my garage
My pockets look like Rerun, your pockets look like Raj

Look how that flag hangin', gangbangin' I ain't no punk
Maintain 'til that thang come out the trunk, make that K go pop, pop, pop
I'm 'bout my business boy, makin' money never been so smooth
Your *** you 'bout to lose 'cause she about to choose
And that's the way it goes, S N double O
You want that quiet type, I want that trouble ***
Now go get paper girl, yeah, I meant for real
One time I told a *** not to come back
Til she got two thousand dollars in two dollar bills
That's cold game, a hoe thang
I'm high as 'Soul Plane', I *** the whole thang
You know how daddy do it, I'm true to it
I take a cocaine Buick and put some blue to it
That's some gangsta ***, these *** love this gangsta ***
Khakis and some gangsta kicks, yeah, *** that's my gangsta fit
I'm ballin' boy and you ain't got to ask
She all about this pimpin', I'm all about this cash
