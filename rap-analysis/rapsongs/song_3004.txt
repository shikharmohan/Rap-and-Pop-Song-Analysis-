Uh-huh, one time
Yessuh yessuh
Now what they know about the banana and mayonnaise
Slices of toasted bread on the napkin
Straight up nuts with this country drawl
It ain't no reason lookin' for it ain't no fuckin' flaw
I didn't go to bed without my lucky bear claw
See, I'm a rare stud lookin' to bloom like a mushroom
In the jug, under hot lights, crystallize so nice
When I think twice, I love long summer nights
Four records deep, and I still get stage fright
From small towns to the big city night lights
If you don't like what I say, fly away, fly away
If you don't like where I stay, fly away
There's a ghetto in every city
Politicians slangin' slurs, high from the natural herb
Ain't no runnin' from niggaz everywhere you go, drankin' alcohol
Ready to call Earl, it's your world, black man
Them devils can't stand how we makin' moves, smooth
Avoidin' legal hassles goin' unseen like the hand that took
Then documented it in his book
How these niggaz shook the world with the hook
Now they back like jack in that red Cadillac
Now Git, don't let the doorknob hit ya where the good lord split ya
I'm hearin' rumors too that you so gone off that D and PCP
That thoughts of lettin' another man sample your wine
Haunts your mind look like the color pink
Rubbin' elbows with the wrong folks makin' kin breach they skin
Secretaries terminated after seein' the boss pack fudge
Dirty men need to do more than bathe, huh
How's about burned at the stake like the rest of those sodomites
Even though you had beautiful kids and a wife
He still bent both ways, ain't no due process
For boys that become gulls or verse visa
Field niggaz control this pin the hollow point tip
On this gay rights activists a ghetto game we all familiar wit'
Now how many licks, did it take, to get you wet
You ends today, fly away, fly away, now
If you don't like what I say, fly away, fly away
If you don't like where I stay, fly away
Yeah, well, I'm from the dirty, filthy nasty dirty south
Some of you niggaz still think we soft
And I swore, I wouldn't never write no rhyme like this
But now you're startin' to piss me off
Oh yesh y'all, Sugah he got that silky southern drawl
Every tooth in my mouth, got gold on em' all
I'm 'eal strong, and we don't want no bad blood
But it is some, it is some
Nigga think he gotta, better mind frame then me
Nigga really think he got mo' game then me?
Gonna make me sick, they gonna think you slick
But fuck around and make me click like a magic trick
'Cause I'll prove your ass wrong bout me
We so deep and quick to stomp a nigga to sleep
And, uh, we don't like to kill, but we will
Oh Lord this south is sho' nuff trill, now shit
When we on your side of town, we don't ask why
We abide by the rules that y'all live by
And see, you're welcome to come, you're welcome to stay
But any disrespect, we will make yo' ass fly away
If you don't like what I say, fly away, fly away
If you don't like where I stay, fly away
If you don't like what I say, fly away, fly away
If you don't like where I stay, fly away
