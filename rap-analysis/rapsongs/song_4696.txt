I'ma make you feel good
It'll be my pleasure to take you out the hood
Let you shop 'til you drop
Let you pick your own rocks
I'ma carry the bags
Tell you little things, make you giggle and laugh
In the strawberry bubble bath
The future's bright, baby forget about the past
Get your toes done
Sacrifice our love for no one
French perfume
Brand new mansion, let you decorate the rooms
Breakfast in the suite
Walk hand in hand in the French Riviera streets
Make no mistake
I'ma get you what you want, girl whatever it takes
You should know how to treat your girl, playboy
(You should know how to treat her)
You should know how to treat your girl, playboy
(That's your girl playboy)
I'ma caress your face
Give you the keys to your new place
Just don't touch my safe
That's forbidden fruit and that would be a waste
Which bracelet you want?
What shoes you wanna flaunt?
You like the Gucci joints
Or the Manolo Blahniks 'cause they ultra sheek
Have you lookin' like a runway model
Sippin' Perrier your way out of custom bottles
Aromatherapy and massages
Take you to church baby, teach you who God is, Amen
Tell me what you like
Where you wanna go, we goin' there tonight
No question I'm the real McCoy
You ain't gotta be a pimp if she loves you playboy
You should know how to treat your girl, playboy
(You should know how to treat her)
You should know how to treat your girl, playboy
(To the bridge, to the bridge)
I tease you with the tip
I'll bite your bottom lip
Make you climax real quick
Over and over again, it's sick
Orderin' your favorite food
Incense and candles, I set the mood
Tear you up on Playstation 2
You on the phone with your aunt 'cause I'm lacin' you
Pillow fights in the water bed, mirrors on the ceiling
Hot and sweaty, clothes start peeling
Why you think the waterfall's in the shower
Float with me, the world is ours
You a pretty little thing, you know?
You keep me hungry, make me wanna get dough
That's why I take care of you
Most men can't do what I do, you know?
You should know how to treat your girl, playboy
(You should know how to treat her)
You should know how to treat your girl, playboy
(That's your girl playboy)
You should know how to treat your girl, playboy
(You should know how to treat her)
You should know how to treat your girl, playboy
(That's your girl playboy)
Yeah, treat you right baby
I'll treat you right, yeah
