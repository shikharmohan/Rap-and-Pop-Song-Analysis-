Stoned is the way of the walk
Stoned is the way of the walk
Well, it's the Alley Cat puffin' on a hootie rat
Some think I'm a criminal but, yo I ain't all of that
Hit'cha with the baseball bat an' ya wanna ill though
Wanna mess around, you get fucked on the hill bro
Kick it like a steel toe, real slow, hits from the bong
Make me feel like Cheech and I'm kickin' it wit' Chong
Just like Cheech and Chong frontin' with 'ice cream'
Cypress Hill is here to give you a nice dream
Speak it like a rolla', and you know it's rolled tightly
I'm like the funky beat, so, why ya tryin' ta fight me
Pigs often site me, that's not polite G
And any hour of the day ya know
I might be harassed by a pig real fast
They wanna Rodney King me
Always tryin'a crown my ass
Ain't got no class, no class
I hit they' ass like the buddah that's stinkey
They wanna' scruff but they' just so rinky-dinky
I'm the freaka, the one who freaks the funk
Sen got's the Philly, an' he's gonna light the blunt
Sippin' off the [Incomprehensible] makes me go koo-koo
Somethin' like loco then turn in to this loocoo
Binggin' the beta, yea, now the funk is risen
Got the beta bass and the nasal highzen
As I kick atrip, it comin' straight from my siness
Crazy nasal vocals, cannot make the hotties loco
I rimemba sista Maggie, breast were kinda saggy
Used to sell me buddah outta fucked up little baggies
Honeyd up a twenty even when I had no money
She said "Pay me back with some latin dick, Sonnie"
Well, I neva' went out, and I don' think I'm gonna
Just for some buddah, she wanted me ta bone her
Deminin', ya think ya know what I'm meanin'
I got somethin' for the hoes ta be skeamin' on
I'm the Buddah Real. take a trip ta Hoota'ville
I'll throw ya out the door, of my big blue Siville
Then light another joint, this ain't no exploitation
Cause we are the ones stonein' in the ways of the mastas
Stoned is the way of the walk, stoned is the way of the walk
Stoned is the way of the walk, stoned is the way of the walk
Hit they, hit they ass, make the buddah get stinkey
Alas, Captain there's a ship in sight
Huh, blast 'em!
