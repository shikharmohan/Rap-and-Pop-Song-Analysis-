Yo, Ice, man, we halfway done with the album, man
You been throwing all this strong dope, stupid fly, pimp shit
But what's up with the sex rhymes
You ain't thrown no sex rhymes yet, man, what's up with that?
Yo man, I didn't even want to really do none this year, man
Yo, why you ain't want to do none, man?
Titties, man sex, sex, sex, man, all that
We need some sex
Man, I really wasn't about that, homes
Not? C'mon, man, just throw one sex joint man
For me and my boys, man, me and the man
The Niggas, man whassup?
Oh, aight, check this out, E, check this out
The other night I was out at this club, alright
