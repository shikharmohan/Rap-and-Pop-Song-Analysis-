Hey, yeah, hello, stranger
It seems so good to see you back again
Tell me how long has it been?
Seems like a mighty long time
It seems like a mighty long time
Oh, oh, oh, my, my, my, I'm so glad
You stopped by to say, "Hello" to me
Remember that's the way it used to be
It seems like a mighty long time
Ooh, seems like a mighty long time, oh yeah
Oh yes, I'm so glad you are here again
Oh, oh, if you're not gonna stay
Please don't tease me like you did before because I still love you so
Although it seems like a mighty long time
Listen baby, it seems, seems like a mighty long time
Oh my, my, my, my, my
I'm still have you baby
I think you are here to last
I'm stayin', stayin' down here longer this time
Still love you
