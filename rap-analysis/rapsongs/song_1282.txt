[Shag]
Gimmie that beat, bitch!  (vocal sample: "We Are At War")
Ding Ding Muthafucka
It's round two
I got my nuts and my denim, fool
You think we gonan bow down to some punk ass niggaz
We from the evil side, boy
Chorus: B-Real  [Shag]
Doughboy [Killa], Wack 10 [Killa]
Doughboy [Killa], Wack 10 [Killa]
Doughboy [Killa], Wack 10 [Killa]
Doughboy [Killa], Wack 10 [Killa]
[B-Real]
In about four seconds some east side niggaz
Is gonna put the foot in the ass of Doughboy and Wack 10
I suggest you stay tuned muthafuckas
[B-Real's verse]
It takes two of you faggets to get with one of me
Now I'm running up in you hoes
With "No Vaseline"
You could be the big fish
Bring your drama
Fuck your mama
I'll bring the pack of piranhas
You tried to pull a ditty, ho
But you the one who got the alternative rockers up in your video
You get addicted
You can take your four W fingers and stick it in Mack 10's ass and lick it
Ice Cube is a thing of the past
If I got no nuts it's because they're still stuck in your ass
You're the King of punks
King of busters
King of thieves
Now get down of your fuckin' knees  (Shag: Bow Down)
Start to sucking
You try to remake NWA without Dre and Ren
Dub's cool
But you're fuckin' up with Mack 10
Silly little philly
 I'm back tearing'
Can you really see my machine gun turrets?
Open and aimed at your fat little frame
How can I miss?
I'll twist your cap and take your name
Analyze it
My name should be Mack 11
 I'm a higher caliber MC
There's no question
Anytime you wann run up
You get dealt with
You get melted
"Check Yo' self" (bitch check it)
Ice Cube, you better tell'em  (tell 'em mutha-fucka)
Muggs made the best songs on your third album (biatch!)
Shag (spoken):
You and Wack 10
Can't deal with this
Cypress Hill to the muthafuckin' fullest
Fuck y'all
So what'cha wanna do?
Bring it on, nigga
This is Shag from the Neighborhood Family
Shag's verse:
Mack 10 is a bitch
Suckin' Ice Cube's dick
But what you faggets know about some gangsta shit  (B-Real: Nothin)
Let's take it to the streets
And fight like real g's
What you niggaz wanna do?
You can't fuck with these
Ain't never had a strap
Now you wanna gangsta rap
Come can't to your hood
'Cause you're scared to get jacked
Fuck peace, this is war
Everybody on the floor
When I see your fat ass
I'm takin' one to your jaw
Fuck you
Fuck your mama
Fuck your whole clique
Better yet, fuck every nigga that you're down wit'
Unoriginal
Can't stand bitch made niggaz
Ice Cube, youse an actor
Not a muthafuckin' killa
What neighborhood you from?
What don't you ever done?
When the shit goes down
You the first one to run
Everytime you talk
Got a mouth full of drama
Only missing you done
Is going to church wit'cha mama
B-Real's verse:
You got the Real-a
Swingi' of fmy nuts
Cube Killa
Break yourself niga, huh!
Give a lick-a
You ain't a killa
You a busta
Muthafucka
Bitch made niggaz
I never trust ya --Cube's "Can't trust 'em"--
Hoes like you can't figure out where you're from
Are you from South Central, the Westside or Compton?
Mack 10, the only thing you hoggin' on
Is Ice Cube's nuts
Now he's all in your guts
You wannabe like him
But you got no skills
If he's the king
You must be the queen of the Hill
 But I shank the Cube's fat neck
'Cause "A Bitch Iz A Bitch"
And a bitch don't get no respect
No doubt
Westside Connections means
Ice Cube's stickin' his dick in Mack 10's mouth  (Aahhh!)
All of your homies are down wit' my clique
Why you always gotta be bitin' my shit
And you don't know one bitch on my dick
But yours is best get a blood test for your kid
Only bangin' you done was with toy figures
Your mama wouldn't let you hang
With real g niggaz
Bring your clique on
You wanna scrap
So let's get it on  (bullets for some chingazos, ese!)
Mack 10
I gibe you a year
I guarantee
You'll realize that you're getting' fucked
And you'll run to me
You pretty little trick
You look real sweet  (Mmmm!)
I should make you one of my hoes like
Cube was for Eazy
Doughboy, you're fuckin' around wit' the real Cuban
I'm no fictional Scarface movie land bullshit
Actor, studio gangsta
You should win an award
For most outstanding wax banger
Fuck what you been through
What you're going through
East Side family, nigga
What you wanna do? 
[Shag]
