Over the globe again from the realm of illadelph
The planet overwhelmed yo just brace ya self
Ya wanna go against me first face ya self I pose threat
To whoever within ya commonwealth the top ten
I'm crushing ya crap concoction
To the utmost examine this up close it's shockin'
Now mic droppin' is only ya option
Here come the spliff scientist in the flesh have you forgotten
His excellency the most poetically inventive official hip hop shit
That's ya incentive to cop this actual fact and not the likeness
'Cuz possibly clones'd try to do it like this
Fathom this lyrically fabulous vocabulist
Hold mic like four fifth and lick shot somewhat like Pete
Malik rock think not I don't smoke I just sleep drink and eat
Think pot and I want the top a vehicle that brakes
God I want the top a vehicle that brinks got composing
To the ink sock my hip hop is wild megawatts
Continue with forever exist and never stop
Yo whut up whatever ock we can thicken tha plot because
And it's time for that and it's about that time
It's time for that and it's about that time
Rob O it's time for that and it's about that time
Pete Rock it's time for that and it's about that time
Black Thought it's time for that and it's about that time
I'm Rob O what, energize like a power plant blow speakers
Without an amp do things these wack rappers can't
And start again 33 RPM the hearts of men
Are cold like the steel I hold on microphones
Let my words express move men like chess
My mic will stand erect like projects
It's drastic top draft pick in this rap shit
You just a fraction caught up in tha midst of action
My catalog is current events breath the contents
What I move crowds for local events the show stopper
98 feature spot rocker Rob Odendo
Now every MC wanna mention me out of envy
Unofficially top of the charts I played my part
Held it down from the start you know the M.O.
Yeah yeah Rob Odendo
And it's time for that and it's about that time
It's time for that and it's about that time
Rob O it's time for that and it's about that time
Pete Rock it's time for that and it's about that time
Black Thought it's time for that and it's about that time
Yo it's the Capital P book rhymes of the century
Speak rap line essentially on tha M I C
I hold the mic appliance like science
My competitors and clients worldwide as my words coincide
With real life think twice transmit like true lies
It's televised take my manuscripts out of context
Who want next situation is complex
Stop the nonsense it's 98 time to set the record straight
Separate movers and shakers from those that hesitate
Ya featherweight name carry weight in every state
Ya name brand no frills niggaz is marinate
It's Pete Rock new world innovator
Crush imitators five years since the creator
It's nuff said as I paint the town red and move ahead
And it's time for that and it's about that time
It's time for that and it's about that time
Rob O it's time for that and it's about that time
Pete Rock it's time for that and it's about that time
Black Thought it's time for that and it's about that time
