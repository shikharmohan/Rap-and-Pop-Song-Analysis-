Ole Buddah coming at your life
Direct with the biggest fattest joint
Coming in with indo flavors
From Buddha, comin' at you like this in '95
It's Friday morning, where the weed at?
Let me dip into my pocket for my fat weed sack
'Cause I wanna get high like a plane
In the sky with the indo cloud in my brain
Where the fuck are my Zig Zags and my lighter?
So I can roll it and set it on fire
Damn, I wish I had scissors 'cause the shit is so sticky
That it's getting on my fuckin' fingers
But it's smoke-able, double tokable
I got the one-hitter
And the Bombay shit that's tokable
I wanna do a joint venture
Let me make sure there ain't no lump
In the goddamn center
The impregnated-looking joint, fuck it
I can smoke it and still get faded
Roll it up, light it up, smoke it up, inhale, exhale
Roll it up, light it up, smoke it up, inhale, exhale
Roll it up, light it up, smoke it up, inhale, exhale
Roll it up, light it up, smoke it up, inhale, exhale
I'm the freaka, the one who freaks the funk
I'm the freaka, the one who freaks the funk
I'm the freaka, the one who freaks the funk
I'm the freaka, the one who freaks the funk
East Coast hittin' that blunt West Coast
Hittin' that honey-dipped marijuana joint
And I want another hit, roll it up, light it up, smoke it up
I wanna stimulate my mind so I toke it up
Can I get a hit, can I get a woo?
Gimme that fat bag of weed and the broom
So I can get faded, elevated
Smoked the joint down with my bro's and I ate it
I stand true to the yesca
(Mota)
As I keep runnin' from the chota
Gimme that weed, fool, and your Zig Zags
Puto, don't be holdin' out on the big bag
Roll it up, light it up, smoke it up, inhale, exhale
Roll it up, light it up, smoke it up, inhale, exhale
Roll it up, light it up, smoke it up, inhale, exhale
Roll it up, light it up, smoke it up, inhale, exhale
I'm the freaka, the one who freaks the funk
I'm the freaka, the one who freaks the funk
I'm the freaka, the one who freaks the funk
I'm the freaka, the one who freaks the funk
