Aiyo Mary, I need you to vibe wit me on this one
Uh, uh
Check it
As I grab my pad and pen and begin to talk from within
Oh God, my eyes they water like a preacher who's sinned
I'm only human but the world has put me on a platform
Since the day I was born
To only wait for my downfall but like a brick wall, I'm too hard to break
Okay I do make mistakes but I'm the realest from the fake
That's why I'm the hardest to hate
I live baby girl, I've learned to love those while they still awake
Sleep sleep
And prepare a place for those who are good in the projects and hood
Give to those who are misunderstood
I know Lisa, Pac and Biggie and Jay and Pun are still number 1
There will be more of us to come
I am a leader, a teacher I gotta
Like a single parent provider
Put in back those hip-hop dividers
Like a priest with a back slider
I've sinned but I win
And anyone we've lost in life from 9-11
We'll be sure to see again
What you hear is not a test, I'm rockin' to the beat
See me and my crew, and my friends were gonna try to move our feet
See I am Mary Blige and I'd like to say hello
To the black, to the white, the red and the brown, the purple and yellow
First you gotta, but first you gotta
Yo, I don't wait for the DJs to drop bombs on my records
I drop 'em on my own shit
