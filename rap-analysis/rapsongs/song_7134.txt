Yeah, yeah, ya'll already know what it is, pimp
T.I.P., king of the motherfuckin' south
BGizzzy, let's do it homie
Grand Hustle, pimp, Chopper City in here
Got my nigga Blok in this bitch
Eastside represent Westside Bankhead nigga, it is on, what
A-town nigga, you know what it is, on through Mechanicville
Snow Hill nigga, Pittsburgh, all my real niggas ride out with me
Ya'll know what's happening, PSC nigga
I can give you what you want, T.I.P. the hottest
Game withcha ya need, I can tell ya all about it
You can come up in the streets but it ain't no gettin' out it
When I tell ya I'm a "G", pimp, I'm really being modest
I can tell ya bout the dope boyz, hoes and the ballers
The pimps and the macks, real niggas wouldn't call us
Hanging in the traps 'cause that's what our daddy taught us
From 30's on the 'lac, to a Benz on Broddas
Standin' on the corners, slingin' crack and stacking dollars
Till it's time to cop a brick and I'm tired of moving quarters
My daddy won't a doctor and my momma won't a lawyer
I ain't never had shit, congragulations is in order
Tryin' to get a mill for my sons and my daughters
If I caught a bad bitch with connections down in Florida
Said her daddy and her uncle, still gettin' cross the water
I'm richer now, I'd be a motherfuckin' fool, if I don't call her
What it is my nigga, what it do, what it do
I got a brick or two, I'm finna to buss a move, buss a move
What it is my nigga, what it do, what it do
I got a tool and I'm finna cut the fool
What it do, what it do, what it do, what it do, what it do
My nigga, what it do, what it do, what it do, what it do, what it do
What it do, what it do my nigga, what it do and what it do
I'm a H U S T L E R
If I don't know you, then fuck ya, if I know ya, I front ya
But ya gotta break me off, you don't, I catch ya slippin' on the block
And knock you off, I know people, I get nice deals
Get'em five dollars, sell'em ten dollars a pill
I know people, get ki's for thirteen
If I fuck with ya, then get 'em for sixteen
I know people, get'em three hundred a pound
Give'em to ya for five hundred if you my round
I'm a hustler, holla at me uptowm
I'm well connected with weed, white, tan and brown
Come see a nigga, want a nice sixteen
You real, we swap work, you fake, it's twenty G's
It's like that, I dun been through the struggle
I'm running Chopper City, and fucking with Grand Hustle
What it is my nigga, what it do, what it do
I got a brick or two, I'm finna to buss a move, buss a move
What it is my nigga, what it do, what it do
I got a tool and I'm finna cut the fool
What it do, what it do, what it do, what it do, what it do
My nigga, what it do, what it do, what it do, what it do, what it do
What it do, what it do, my nigga, what it do and what it do
I got the eye of a tiger and the heart of a bear
I'm the king of the jungle you can follow me there
Now you can hear it from these niggas, who hardly was there
Or take it from niggas, who fought and make it a scar to get here
Several years ago, I told myself that I solemnly swear
Forever be hard to kill, even harder to scare
One reason why me and the other cats is hard to compare
'Cause I'm fact, that's fiction, it hardly compares
Being hated, part of the game,yes, it's hard but it's fair
Well, I'ma be the best hating nigga, see if I care
But just know, I'm raising the bar and I'm keeping it there
And I'ma still ride clean, throwing weed in the air
With two or three bad bitches, got they feet in the air
Say they like when I smack on they ass, and skeet in they hair
Listen, I don't care if you got the song of the year
Ya whole show shut down, if the "Don" appears
What it is my nigga, what it do, what it do
I got a brick or two, I'm finna to buss a move, buss a move
What it is my nigga, what it do, what it do
I got a tool and I'm finna cut the fool
What it do, what it do, what it do, what it do, what it do
My nigga, what it do, what it do, what it do, what it do, what it do
What it do, what it do, my nigga, what it do and what it do
