Catch it, so just play it on a record
And take it off until you ass naked
Word to mother, shorty stack like a horse
Pushin' a force, lookin' to floss Diana Ross
Flow better, one of the biggest seller

All up in your body whippin' the Maserati
Through the city with one of my hottie

Whip about to 'cause all in the jam
Nigga's whylin' out at the bar

Shit that make your DJ
Spin it back 4 times yo
Let it rain and let it drizzles
Heat in the club be makin' you sizzle
All of the bitches right in the middle

Making you sweat makin' you get busy
Got y'all niggas loosin' your breath
So I started walkin' this way
Pass the sting rays, see the Kunta Kintai

Hey Mister DJ hit with a replay, check it
Hey why you all in my face
Give me some leeway

Other nigga's racin'
And whylin' all on a freeway
Rushin' to get in a club and get all up in the place
Get inside and see Flipmode in your face
