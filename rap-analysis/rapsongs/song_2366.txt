[Intro]
So i changed, huh
You got a phone,
Pick it up, call me
[Chorus:]
How come, we don't even talk no more,
And you don't even call no more,
We don't barely keep in touch at all,
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no mo',
And I heard it through the grape vine we even beefin' now,
After all the years we've been down,
Ain't no way, no how,
This bullshit can't be true,
We family, aint a damn thing change unless it's you
[Verse One]
We were so young,
So full of life and vibrant,
Side by side wherever you was ridin', I went,
So close almost was some Bonnie and Clyde shit,
When Ronnie died you was right by my side,
With a shoulder to cry on and a tissue to wipe my eyes,
And a bucket to catch every tear I cried inside it,
You even had the same type of childhood I did,
Sometimes I just wanna know why,
Is it that you surcame to yours,
And mine I survived it,
You ran the streets I nine to fived it,
We grew up, grew apart this time went by us,
Then I blew up to both yours and mine surprises,
Now I feel the vibe I just cant describe it,
Much as your pride tries to hide it,
You're cold your touch, its like ice,
And your eyes is the look of resentment,
I can sense it and I don't like it
[Chorus]
(Kon Artis)
[Verse Two]
It was my dream at first to be on spittin the verse,
On my own album with a deal but shit got worse,
So I came out I would'a killed the nigger first,
'Fore I let him disrespect me,
Or check me up with somethin' worse,
Some bitch that I wasn't with,
I would hit her & quit,
but you would pull a talk with her 
&& tell her she was the shit
I told you don't get involved with her,
You were smoking the cron'c with her,
Coming out'a the bar with her,
Stumblin' half drunk,
Like y'all husband or wife or somthin',
But you cathin her fucken other niggaz
Must've hurt your pride or somthin',
'Cause you wolf I fit them after people,
Like you want it with me,
When all I tried to do is show you that your girl was shifty,
and ever since the fans and all the shit that i produced
You actin' like I ain't your man,
And lyin' like she can't be loose,
But I am really your friend,
I'm just trying to tell you the truth,
Don't hate the game or the playa',
The one that's changin is you
[Chorus]
(Proof)
[Verse Three]
We gettin lonely at the top
'cause my homie had to stop
now we actin like i gotta live only for the block
and homies in the hood only see me on the tube
so they gossip on the porch, get to speakin on who 
fools i used to rap with, all expect magic
like my finger get to snappin and *poof* it just happen
but Proof its just actin, at the party were stoned
shady made it so my babys aint starvin at home
see the devil in your grin, since the ghetto we been friends
forever, real intelligence, thats forever till the end
I peep the hatred in your eyes and the Satan in your lies
aint wastin my time with these snakes in disguise
(How come) when you talk its with bitter with fight
(And how come) its my fault for what you did with your life
and every time i go to hear you and play you look away
we barely embrace, you cant even look me in my face
(Chorus)
