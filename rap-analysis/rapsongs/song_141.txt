You don't see me in the hood
It's 'cause I'm doing this man
Niggas, I'm still grinding, I still hearing those sirens
I'm still getting chased by those lights
Only the light's lime and my mic's on
And my time is none because I'm writing more
An' I ain't here to meet a soul in this business
I'm here to eat, speak until these hoe's feel this
And I can't let y'all derail me, man
I got Young Kobe homey, you gotta let go off Obie
'Cause Obie be back, we got them craps going on
And that yak going on, soon as a nigga touch down, back from town
It's forever, put that on the cheddar, man
But in the meantime, it's Jimmy Iovine time
Chase cheese, rhyme 'til my voice give out
This is it my niggas, this what we boast about
Now I'm here, so shut your motherfucking mouth
And show me love, bitch
I just wanna love you for the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the morn, hold you through the night
I just wanna love you for the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the morn, hold you through the night
There's a certain mystique when I speak that you notice
That's sort of unique 'cause you know it's me
My poetry's deep and I'm stillmatic, the way I flow to this beat
You can't sit still, it's like trying to smoke crack and go to sleep
I'm strapped, it's known any minute I could snap
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry, it ain't even money
You can't pay me enough for you to play me
It's cockamamie you just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady
My noodle is cock-a-doodle, my clock's coo-coo
I got screws loose, yea the whole kitten caboodle, I'm just brutal
It's no rumor, I'm numero uno, assume it
There's no humor in it, no more you know
I'm rolling with a swollen bowling ball in my bag
You need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass
You better love me, bitch
I just wanna love you for the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the morn, hold you through the night
I just wanna love you for the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the morn, hold you through the night
My buzz is crazy in the hood, they holla my name
If it ain't about the flow, it's 'bout the stones and the chain
If I was you, I'd love me too, I roll like a boss
Nine Eleven Porsche same color as cranberry sauce
I ain't gon' front, I thought R. Kelly was the shit
Let me find out he fucking 'round with Bow Wow bitch
Niggas eating popcorn right, rewinding the tape
Now shorty mama in the precinct, hollering rape
I'm convinced, man, something really wrong with these hoe's
I thought Lil' Kim was hot 'til she start fucking with her nose
I used to listen to Lauryn Hill and tap my feet
Then the bitch put out a CD, it didn't have no beats
That boy D'Angelo, he determined not to fail
That nigga went butt-ass, for his record to sell
My back shots'll help Ashanti hit them high notes
And Big Ben taught Charli B'More to deep throat
I just wanna love you for the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the morn, hold you through the night
I just wanna love you for the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the morn, hold you through the night
