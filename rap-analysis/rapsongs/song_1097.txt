Girl, she used to dance at magic city
The other girls couldn't be half as pretty
You look so sexy when you grab them
Ooh, oh, yes
Sugar, good Lord, you'd been blessed
If this is a sin I must confess
The way you dress is like birthless
I guess you don't mind been in undress
I like your way, it's going down
Hips are moving all around
Round and round, upside down
A once was lost but now I'm found
Sweetheart that you get me another round
Sweat in like you loosing pounds
Touch the ground, make a sounds
