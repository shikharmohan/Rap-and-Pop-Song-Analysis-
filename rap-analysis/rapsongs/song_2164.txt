Pay attention, this one with extension, big boots with the gloves
Seems she's lookin for love
Spent a dub at the bar with her, see I promised not to hit her
long as I can get her
to the floor fashion show, short skirt and high heels
so the ass can show, satisfaction
Action make her ask for mo', gettin dough
Don't need no hoe that's po', you know?
You'd rather blow fo' with the snowbunny, well I ain't mad
cause the hoe money mo' money, sweet as snow money
Bring it to a pimp so he maintain wealth
Forty G's on the yacht, I got cock for sale
Might bail to Miami, nine hoes deep
Red Bull and my bad hoes get no sleep
Gators on my feet, I talk shit you know
on how everything here is a hoe

[E-40]	Beeyatch!
Smell, smell, Char-lie
Smell, smell, smell me
Smell, smell, the cheezie
Smell, smell, smell away
You can't make a tramp a champ even if you put her on a stamp
That bitch still wouldn't be worth a cryin dime
a blue nickel, or a screamin quarter
40-Water put it in order
Bitch it's about CB&H; and I ain't talkin about pure cane sugar
I'm talkin about cock a butt and HEAD
Cock, butt, and head
Cock, butt, and head
Cock, butt, and head
Cock, butt, and head
[E-40]	Beeyatch!
[Roger Troutman voice]
