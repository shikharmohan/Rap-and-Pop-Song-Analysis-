(Boo gotta blunt in his ear)
The clock is tickin 
the cops is sittin waitin on me to pop the ribbon so i can get locked in prison
but i forgive em
they dont know i got the bishop
givin me a future face they cannot prevent it
skys the limit, i travel but i tries to pivot
look in my eyes and combine the spirits
time'll end it
if its not a coupla g's its dimes and pennies
if i dont break a knuckle or knee, my shine is finished
im climbin in it but i could fall down the chimney
a hound is in me so dont come around or near me
you clowns is really f**kin up 
ya bound to get it
i sit a barrel on ya tongue so round and pretty
fought my ticket now ima skip town and kick it
dress code just some khaki brown lil Dickies
got them pounds and chickens stuffed and coffee grounds in visions nigga
chorus: x2

Birdman keep askin me to stick 22's on the Rolls and i keep tellin him no but

im the screw face to this rap game
weezy put me on new face with the same name
oh yes i did get em kid if i ask ya

faster than a panther goes the lead from the clapper
round up ya boys get this round of applause
