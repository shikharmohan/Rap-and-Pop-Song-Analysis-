Intro:  
 Eeeyeahh  
 
 Wuditlooklike  to all you trick bitches  
 and you punk ass niggaz out there  
 I'm talkin to you live from WFDS  
 It's about two thousand degrees down this motherfucker  
 We're From the DarkSide radio  
 But the funk just don't stop  
 As we take y'all fat roly poly asses on another journey  
 To the darkside...  
 
 Verse One:  
 
 Wuditlooklike? When I wipe off my sweat  
 Verbally I'm Untouchable like Elliot Ness  
 To the best of my ability I rock any facility  
 And fuck the yellow cabs I smoke buddha out deliveries  
 I'm just as high as the fuckin friendly skies  
 Cause the buddha I smoke, is no joke, when I'm loc'ed  
 When I'm, open, you can't even see my chinky eyes  
 Then I wet it, then you be like -- that shit be soaked!!  
 and Two Black Guys when I get busy like the L.I.  
 I'm saggin my.... Karl Kani...  
 Well I, swing it back and forth like a leaf  
 But I can pass niggaz straight out of first-class  
 Without traffic I flow like the B.Q.E.  
 PPP, got the glocks and techs  
 Then leave em huffin and puffin like first day at Lemans class  
 
 Chorus: repeat 4X  
 And Def Squad always got some fly shit on deck  
 
 I said wuditlooklike (wuditlooklike)  
 Wuditlooklike (wuditlooklike)  
 
 
 Verse Two:  
 A-hem...  
 The Funk Doctor Spock blow the watt through your box  
 I come hotter than Treach, you bet about callin the cops  
 Because (this type of funk you don't hear on the regular)  
 Rock six seven eight nine ten (to eleven ta)  
 Knew my style got more powers than Cocoon  
 Zoom your focus, I drop the mic and leave it smokin  
 When I'm vexed, my concepts Wreck like Effect  
 I'm robbin your brains with antilogical, phenomical  
 Verbal communications blow to the next ep  
 Suicidal with lethal type funk spread your nodules  
 Straight up the weight up plus I max like a Beta  
 Boy I fuck your head up like a blunt that's laced up  
 The boogie verbalist, vocalist  
 I get open with, puttin scannings on the fake soloist  
 My style reachin down like Ike, switch up like dykes and  
 You'll be tellin your psychologist wuditlooklike  
 Chorus  
 
 Verse Three:  
 
 
 Wuditlooklike suckers, punk motherfuckers  
 Bitches be actin funny, don't wanna show me no love 'cause  
 They think I'm crazy and like mentally sick  
 Ahhh, give em the dick then they quiver like fish, then I  
 Smoke a pound of herb a day, and yo  
 Some bitches say, I'm the Mack like Maceo  
 I don't be that I just beez the funk disease  
 The funkindominal, I bring drama to any rendezvous  
 Rock three-sixty-five, twenty-four, Monday through  
 that leave MC's, recognizing like Sam Sneed  
 That other shit, makes them other ship, flip  
 funk ridiculous, inconspicous with lyrics  
 A-uhhm, oh-seven-one-oh-three's where I from  
 Been gettin dumb, every since Harlem World used to jump  
 I bust off the glock for the hood and the block  
 Chorus And that's for all them hardrock niggaz that's comin in flocks
