Uh, Fiji water granddaddy purp,
Excuse me I let the semi-automatic burp,
Blood game muthafucka call me red alert,
Young Carter kill in order, who get it first?
Stuff that girl wit dick 'till her head burst
Young Weezle flow needles I can thread shirts
Boy you ain't did shit, I had done said worst
Flip your fitted cap back like Fred Durst
Uh, Fiji water O.G. kush, yeah, I drink verses and eat hooks
Got the stove on my waist, and we cooks
I'm in the way you can't pass like Aaron Brooks
Uh, President ride the car slow, I let my driver drive,
I'm on par 4
Spit hangin' from my mouth retard flow
And I say what I want like an award show
I'm on some shit ain't even came out the ass yet
Sit back and watch the green grow like the grass wet
Young or old their ain't no comparing me
I just cleared that up
Moment of clarity, Uhh
[Verse 2]
Uh, Im about to go almonds,
Young head bussa, get your helmets
You niggas real soft. What is that velvet?
I get big chips, you get Alvins
Uh, I'ma bout to go walnuts,
We get seven digit money you can call us
Hit 'em wit the choppa, watch 'em ball up
Paint your face red, you all dolled up
Yeah, Young Nino nigga,
I do it for my team Tim Tebow nigga
I'm killing this shit grim reap flow nigga
Gettin' swallowed by the Maybach deep throat nigga
Uh, I'ma bout to go Planters,
I'm still in my prime, Dion Sanders
We all gamblers, I will not lose
Flow precious as diamonds, I drop jewels
Uh, gimme mine or Imma take mine
Smokin' purple,I heard thru the grape vine
Weezy Baby aka your highness, I just killed this shit
Moment of silence, uh
[Verse 3]
Uh, I'm in the zone like a fastball,
And I fuck the game like a bad call,
Let the money stack, don't let the cash fall
Bars all day, no last call,
Uh, I'm in the redzone nigga,
Wake up in the mornin' with your head gone nigga
Birdman Jr. wings spread on niggas,
Leave the beef in the streets and bring the bread home nigga
Yeah, tell the doctor step aside please,
Dr. Carter gasoline in your IV's
Strong dry weed, make my eyes bleed,
Strong arm rap, I rock an iron sleeve
Uh,I'm in the zone like the secondary,
No lie bitch I'm flyer than a pet canary
Imma dog on the beat fuck the veterinary,
Two women praise me like Mary Mary,
Uh, I'm in the zone like college ball,
Spit fire like Im sippin on a molotov
Lose bowels, this shit so easy
(Jay-Z: I might send this to the mixtape Weezy)
