Baby, it's not true
When they say all men are dogs
'Cuz I know alot of women who cheat
I know you kinda wondering
Why I'm having this conversation with you
'Cuz I speak upon experience
And if was worth anything
I'll never cheat again
I know I may act stubborn boy
But that don't mean I don't love you, boy
Please forgive me for my attitude
When it seems, I'm takin' all my shit out on you
I know, I never said this here
Let me make myself loud and clear
I appreciate the way you treat me
I've done a lot of things you still don't hate me
Remember when you caught me cheatin', cheatin'
You said I stopped your heart from breathin', breathin'
But you loved me so you forgave me, gave me
When you could've ran out and played me, played me
Am I a disappointment to you baby?
Most of the time I'm wrong
Makin' excuses for the abuses I've done
Stepping all over your heart
But you never let me baby
Say I'm sorry all the time
Any other guy would be gone
But you stayed right by my side
Oh cheatin'
Cheatin'
You said I stopped your heart from breathin'
But you loved me so you forgave me, gave me
When you could've ran out and played me, played me
And the love like this, I can't play no games
'Cuz it's hard to forgive it, but you didn't never complain
Never rub it in my face, just let me slide on by
I know that every girl, wish she had you as a guy
'Cuz you're mine, mine, oh mine
No no no no, no no no
'Cuz a love like this can't play no games
And it's hard to forgive things I did to you
Let me slide on by, yeah
Have you ever gave?
When I cheated you said you couldn't breathe
Said you couldn't breathe
Now I'm sitting here beggin' on my knees
Take me back, I'll do anything including please
I didn't mean to burn a bridge third degree
Like fantasia said, "Let yourself be free"
The truth be, without me you'll succeed
I'm sorry baby, please believe in you and me
C'mon
Ain't no love better than you
With all the pain I put you through
I'm still closin' mountains
And you still love me but you know
Ain't no love better than you
With all the pain I put you through
I'm still closin' mountains
Without you here what would I do
Remember when you caught me cheatin'
