One wa-wa one, one two, one two
One wa-wa one, one two, one two
One tigga one, one two, one two
Dug Inf on production, my man
Com for the discussion, check it
One day, I was tryin' to be myself
The same day this thug say, "You gotta come hard"
Nigga, times is hard, I'm tryin' hard to make it
It ain't hard to tell, it's hard for me to fake it
Plus, it's hard to be me, it's hard to stop drinkin'
I guess it's hard for you hard niggaz to start thinkin'
Pussy MCs stinkin' so I can't get hard
Some, become MCs 'cause it's hard to get a job
Hard for you to trust people, you don't trust in God
Even harder to be the Gods we created to be
This Western way of life ain't native to me
Put one nigga in your Pulp Fiction that related to me
I hate it that we, the only race that call our women hoes
Niggaz, be too hard to say, "Ho" at the shows
I rose like a florist to bring the flavor like a Taurus
Might not have the murderous verse, but I stay hard to the chorus
Took this girl to work, she say I ain't have a real job
Like that dick you had last night, baby, I work real hard
Simple motherfuckers tellin' me hard is criminal
Niggaz you thought was hard, you pourin' out your liquor for
Years ago, I thought I was hard, in high school fightin'
Now, I'm the hardest man working in show business
Handle your business or shut the fuck up
It's just one two many niggaz got cars and no land
One two many niggaz with cash and no plan
One two many niggaz that's tryin' to MC
That's one two many niggaz comin' up to me
That's one two many niggaz
Just one two many niggaz
Just one two many niggaz
That's one two many niggaz
Just one two many niggaz
One, two
Forever, I ain't gon' be rappin'
Shit'll happen to me, I gotta let niggaz know
This mark asked me do I know his cousin Jimbo
Nigga, I don't even know myself
You want me to get you in
Jack, I'm trying to get through the do' myself
Opportunity knocked, but he ain't call 'fore he came
Yeah, I got a name, but only twenty dollars to it
Next album you gon' blow, up my ass, you done blew it before
Being in my video, what's that gonna do for your life?
Get you some pussy?  You should be gettin rump off GP
Quit that you look like you say I seen you on TV
I be readin' niggaz but readin' be makin' me sleepy
(Hey)
So strong am I, A Hundred Styles and Runnin'
Niggaz stuck on one and them-a ran by
Claimin' they fly but they stand by
I come truer than a dream, and youse a damn lie
With that anti-rap, complainin' about this and about that
Sounding bitch like, that ain't gonna make a nigga get right
I'm number one
One two many niggaz tryin' to tell me bout they theory
One two many niggaz that ain't tryin' to hear me
One two many niggaz doin' shows that don't happen
One two many niggaz life depend on rappin'
That's one two many niggaz
Just one two many niggaz
Just one two many niggaz
That's one two many niggaz
Just one two many niggaz
One, two
One two many niggaz can't find they niche
One two many niggaz wanna be my bitch
Nigga, one two many niggaz
Nigga, one two many niggaz
Nigga, one two many niggaz
