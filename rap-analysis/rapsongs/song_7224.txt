I been a menace to society
Since when, since menace to society
Still refused to become a legitimate citizen quietly
Felt like my labor hidin' me
But here I am anyway I might be back to slangin' grams any day
And if this record flop well I'll be back wit' a bomb of heart
Wit' C-Rod and the squad this whole industry's a facade
Man this ain't real life
Half these rappers don't know what sacrifice feel like
Man these niggaz is all hype, not even rappin' on real mics
They just get high and say whatever the fuck they feel like
They make me feel like bustin' these niggaz one at a time
And I'm still outbustin' these niggaz hoe pick a rhyme
Ay, what these other niggaz talkin' I don't believe that shit
I'm the king 'cause I said it and I mean that shit
Ay, what's so special 'bout him ay, he ain't all that shit
I set the city in fire have you seen that shit?
Ay, what these other niggaz talkin' I don't believe that shit
I'm the king 'cause I said it and I mean that shit
Ay, what's the big deal about him, he ain't even that shit
I set the city on fire have you seen that shit?
It's only five rappers outta Atlanta who bustin' and I'm one of 'em
The other four, you know who you are
But if you gotta think twice well shawty you ain't nice
Regardless of your publishing deal you can't write
I'm the best thing left blowin' breath on the mic
The king of the south nothin' else will suffice
You wanna bet? Well put yo' budget up
Match the price me and you like putting matches to ice
You won't make it
Before I had a deal I was still butt naked
God signed this, like keeping' the Lord's promise
The truth nigga like Beenie's first LP
You can do a song with N'Sync and couldn't outsell me
I'm a legend in my own time a prophet in my own rhymes
A king wit' a concubine
Ay, what these other niggaz talkin' I don't believe that shit
I'm the king 'cause I said it and I mean that shit
Ay, what's so special 'bout him ay, he ain't all that shit
I set the city in fire have you seen that shit?
Ay, what these other niggaz talkin' I don't believe that shit
I'm the king 'cause I said it and I mean that shit
Ay, what's the big deal about him, he ain't even that shit
I set the city on fire have you seen that shit?
Niggaz like you, a dime a dozen they come and go
So why I'm runnin' now and I ain't never run before
Grab choppers, cock 'em and blow
Stoppin' the show bet or owe 'em, droppin' the hoes
You just keep watchin' the door
Pop 'em, watch 'em drop to the floor fluff his pockets and go
Put a quarter block on his nose and a glock in his clothes
He can keep his watches and gold for his momma to hold
She'll be there buyin' the hoes before the drama unfolds
They know shawty outta control got me hot as a stove
Puttin' holes in yo' Girbaud wettin' up yo' polos
44's and Callico's a black and a chrome
Lettin' loose and splackin' your dome
Hoppin' back in the Brougham
Known for kickin' in yo' door wavin' gats in yo' home
Clearin' it out I'm sorry I ain't hearin' you out
You hearin' about the squad pumpin' Fe in your heart
Because you know sacrifice was near and dear to your heart
Ay, what these other niggaz talkin' I don't believe that shit
I'm the king 'cause I said it and I mean that shit
Ay, what's so special 'bout him ay, he ain't all that shit
I set the city in fire have you seen that shit?
Ay, what these other niggaz talkin' I don't believe that shit
I'm the king 'cause I said it and I mean that shit
Ay, what's the big deal about him, he ain't even that shit
I set the city on fire have you seen that shit?
Ay, my niggaz y'all already know what it is
T-I-P, Grand Hustle, Pimp Squad for life nigga
Sanchez on the beat, dig this man
I'ma keep it always pimpin' I'm stayin' down
Y'all niggaz gone send yo' demos in
Get cha little motherfuckin' deal
Go sell records
Nigga I got houses, I got blow, I got dro
Nigga I got hoes, nigga I got property nigga
What you wanna do nigga?
Fuck y'all niggaz
Come see about me if you don't like it
King of da goddamn south
Rubberband man in this bitch
Uh, oh, uh, oh
