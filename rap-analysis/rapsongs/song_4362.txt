Yeah
Hat to tha front
Lookin' like I'm lightin' up a bat for a blunt
I'm stickin' to the script tryna kick it like a punt
My life is like a movie and I do my own stunts
I'm tha Birdman Jr. call me Young Baby
Could've been a killer but Cash Money saved me
Remember I was little but the cash money made me
Big dog bitch no tramp no lady
Young ass nigga had a thing for old ladies
But as I got older I began to like 'em younga
To Heaven's where I brung her
My wing she was under she say
Daddy they
Daddy they
Daddy they
Daddy they
Daddy they can't do it like you can
I get chips like Vegas and I am not a Blue Man
Too much ice on my wrist and now I got a blue hand
And if I sing "Prostitute" she gon' need some new pants
And if I sing "Pussy Monster" she gon' need a new man
Hello world I would like you all to meet me a new man
Ha body stay on top of ma summer like Susan and hustle
Everyday
Everyday
Everyday
Everyday
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Fillin' up my cup again
Where's that purple stuff again?
I can't get enough of it
Point me in the direction of a Swisha and I'm stuffin' it
Wit' that purple stuff again
I'm on some same color shit
After you do Wayne it's time to do Wayne's brothers bitch
I get money like a fuckin' Wayans brother bitch
I get chill with gurillas and stay away from the
Rattlesnakes
And the Jake's
And the fake
And the hate
Interstate 10 no cops in sight
And I'm comin' back wit' a whole flock tonight
Lord, don't let me get stopped tonight
Or I'ma have to shoot it out with the cops tonight I swear
And tell the jack boys not tonight
Cuz I ain't N'Sync but I will pop tonight
Yeah, that's right if you ain't got that price then go
That way,
That way,
We can't even negotiate
Big money heavy weight
On my way to Heaven's gates
Hope it be them open gates
Flow so appropriate
Don't associate me wit' the bullshit
One wish, I wish a mothafucka would trip
Like a engine I come from under the hood bitch
But now a nigga gettin' paper like a booklet
They ain't hope you wit' it
But now I took it and now they
Never get it
Never get it
Never get it
Never get it
Never get it back yeah that's my word
Bling bling in the dictionary, yeah that's my word
And for me Ja Rule baby just like Erve
Sometimes I still go through the hood just to kiss ma curb
'Cause I love that block nigga Eagle and Apple
O.G.'s, Young G's, Bettles, and Barrows
But God found me like a needle in a barrel
And I'm so ready for war cuz I'm a genius for the battle
Money on my mind, that's all I think of
Married to the game, never takin' my ring off
M.O.B. yeah that's my theme song
Smokin' two L's, rockin' bells like ding dong
Yeah I got my wings on
Flyer than the rest
I don't rest I keep goin'
I just I-G-nore 'em like
Anyway
Anyway
Anyway
Anyway
Anyway it goes I'ma get dough
And I should see the top the way I'm climbin' this pole
A nigga wit' a flu ain't rhymin' this cold
And nigga I'm hotter than a fire in a hole
Steppin' out my shower like a lion in a robe
Eyein' these hoes
Iron in my hol...ster, syrup, purp., cher
Let's elevate
And get away
Accelerate
And never hate
Dedicate this to the blue eyes and blonde hair
I'm on top of my green like a lawn chair
Don't worry I'm straight like arm hair
Don't worry I'm straight like combed hair
This world fucked my pops and I was born here
From tha cell to the jet call it Con Air
I told my niggas that we will see better days
Yesterday
And today is a better day
Celebrate
