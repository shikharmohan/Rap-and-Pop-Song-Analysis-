Yeah, hey, motherfuckin' business here, nigga
Yeah, all you hatin' ass niggaz
What you sneak this in, niggaz?
I see that you don't get your own
It's gon' get you hurt, nigga
If you a hater an' you know it, fuck you
[Incomprehensible] rappin' ass bitches
I rather listen to your instrumentals, nigga
Bitch ass, nigga, do somethin', nigga, see
I'm here now, you old news
Gotta couple Porches, trucks, couple old schools
I'll line ya ass up, push ya tape backwards
'Coz I'ma real nigga an' I don't like rappers
An' that ain't this an' this ain't that
An' bitch, I'm strapped
Fuck wit real niggaz that'll cut ya throat
An' they don't drink Pepsi, they just sell Coke
All I do is talk 'dro, it's like my brain on drugs
See me out, nigga, I do my thang in clubs
Listen up, Jeezy got a little riddle
Stack of 20 dollar bills, two bands in the middle
All the gangstas, they gon' ride to this
They gon' grind to this, they gon' shine to this
This is gangsta music, this is gangsta music
This is gangsta music, this is gangsta music
All the hustlers, they gon' ride to this
They gon' grind to this, they gon' shine to this
This is hustler music, this is hustler music
This is hustler music, this is hustler music
We don't talk on the phones 'coz it might stick
Gotta play for the 7, call it Mike Vick
Dirty birds, nigga, we play wit dem falcons
Know some niggaz in the Decatur that pay for dem falcons
Talkin' young hungry niggaz, eat ya whole plate
Jeezy, place the order, niggaz eat ya whole face
You got me misconstrued all fucked up
Jump out, hit the switch, light ya ass up
Carbon 15 wit the hundred round drum
Got plenty for any nigga, think he wants some
We don't leave 'em at the house, we bring 'em out
My chain for yo' life, we can swap it out
All the gangstas, they gon' ride to this
They gon' grind to this, they gon' shine to this
This is gangsta music, this is gangsta music
This is gangsta music, this is gangsta music
All the hustlers, they gon' ride to this
They gon' grind to this, they gon' shine to this
This is hustler music, this is hustler music
This is hustler music, this is hustler music
The hoes love my voice, make they pussy moist
Certified G shit an' I'm the gangsta's choice
Niggaz poppin' off, I hope they bullet proof
Leave holes in ya, the size of a sunroof
Mack 11 in the club an' a snub nose
Swear to God, knock you niggaz out ya fuckin' clothes
Lay ya ass flat like a doormat
Niggaz askin' for it but they ain't want that
In the rap game, takin' niggaz client
