basically] (24X)  
 
 Whoo  hahh... ohhahh  wooooh  
 Aww shit!!  
 So don't sell me to stale cheese  
 Hey dudes my interludes more fatter than most niggaz LP's  
 
 I'm more nicer than Little Red Robin Hood's grandmama  
 kick more bars than the penile G  
 My grand finale's like an alley when it's rowdy  
 puffin on ganja  sippin on a  Cherry Bianca  
 Click click  bee yow  bang  booyaka!!  
 And let my nine clap loudly  
 What am I do to ya? It's somethin new to ya  
 Like screwin ya, all over my studi-ah  
 Ride on my MP-60 and let the S-950 squeeze your titties  
 
 That quickly I hooked you, now fix me with your lips  
 B...otch, unloosen my belt thinkin to grab the crotch  
 But before you do move my glock before it shoot my cock  
 And see basically them trick bitches get no dap (word)  
 And see basically Redman album is no joke (word)  
 Cause I kill when they fuck with food on my dinner table (word)  
 And see basically I don't get caught up at my label (word)  
 
 I drop a punchline at lunchtime  
 cause I'm a Close Encounter of the None Kind  
 I battle allay'all at one time  
 with dumb rhymes  
 So fuck all you fools out there with the large vocabulary  
 in your sentence, I don't need that shit to pay my rent with, huh  
 And to the nosey snake-ass hoes I ask you  
 Why you be acting all fly  
 always use the underground to make a comeback?  
 And why is it everytime that a multiplatinum artist  
 when your monkey-ass work at fast food?  
 Is it fair to the hardcore niggaz that rap?  
 That don't give a fuck about the radio  
 plus the next bitch at that?  
 And being hardcore and mad about wearing high-tech boots  
 and black skelly hats?  
 And making fake-ass frowns because your best buddy packs?  
 
 Think about it  
 Sip on a chocolate thai, and let your brain fall out of focus  
 This is another episode, coming live from the Funkadelic man himself  
 Yeah  
 Huh Ahhh
