(Alright Go)
This comes from the E Chapter 8 verse 10 and it reads
Its time to put some niggaz in check
When you shoot a gun,hot shells eject
Catch'em they get used as evidence
Only when they get brushed for finger prints
You ask Why am I like this?
'cause you wanna hear about shit like this
So I tell it,how I know it,Just hope the fuck I dont show it
Niggaz out frontn ,lottering and looting.
Lets recreate a drive by shooting
More brothers in a car blocks away
Waiting to spray, shotgun,Mack10 and an AK
They roll thru to a line of nigga's
It was 9 just like tha fuck they figured
Go around tha corner come back real slow
Lights off,cars in neutral,rolln at a snails pace and creepn
Hoping to catch all of them sleepn,a so called gang,drugs and sex (NWA)
Start busting a cap and all tha others jet,3 of'em fall to their doom
Pronounced dead at the scence,with gun shot wounds
3 dead 'cause Compton is scanless.
I'd like to tell ya brother, Ashes to Ashes,Dust to Dust (Amen)
daaaaaaaaa,daaaaaaa,daaaaaaa
(You will now witness tha sound of ??)(We will now pass around tha hat)
(thats good enough)No it aint,you fucked up, you fucked up (its cool) no
it aint
