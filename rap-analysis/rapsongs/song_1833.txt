Hey Mimi
Word?
Get 'em boy, get 'em boy
Get 'em boy, Get 'em boy, boy
X is comin' for ya, can't do nothin' for ya
'Cause X is comin' for ya
Run, hide, duck, duck
We don't give a fuck, fuck
X is comin' for ya, can't do nothin' for ya
'Cause X is comin' for ya
Run, hide, duck, duck
We don't give a fuck, fuck
Look in the mirror say my name five times
Turn out the lights then I done crooked nine live
Don't get scared now nigga finish it 'cause you started it
Watch shit grow out of control now you want no part of it
Nigga where your heart at? Tell me what you made of
Already lost a stripe 'cause I know what you afraid of
We both know you pussy but I ain't gonna say nuttin'
Just hit a nigga off and you can stay frontin'
I gotcha back for now till I cased the joint
Plus give the feds a real good place to point
And laced the joint I ain't gonna front I had my hands full
Glad to be alive but you like that's that bull
But now you know what you get when you fuckin' wit
'Cause you shoulda left alone now you stuck in shit
Duckin' shit till that headpiece gets blazed
Screamin' this ahh cease to the grave
It's over at least for you it is
It don't think the coroner to see how true it is
I knew these kid but did that stop me from gettin' 'em screamin'
It was all for the money while I'm hittin' and splittin' him down
From his nose to his nuts
Fire department comin' put the hoes to his guts
Washed away just like dirt when it rains
And now because of you I hurt when it rains
X is comin' for ya, can't do nothin' for ya
'Cause X is comin' for ya
Run, hide, duck, duck
We don't give a fuck, fuck
X is comin' for ya  can't do nothin' for ya
'Cause X is comin' for ya
Run, hide, duck, duck
We don't give a fuck, fuck
My real name is Damien and my girl's name is Carrie
That poltergeist bitch is hot but too young to marry
That nigga Satan be fakin' mad jacks so I taxed his ass
Every chance I get is just another hit
Another nigga split there go white meat another nigga
Takin' up room in the morgue under a white sheet
That's what you get for tryin' to take it there
But with this desert eagle in your mouth
You cryin' about let's make it fair
Sometimes it takes pain to make the brain a little smarter
When I think the rain will stop it only starts to rain harder
Part of the game is niggaz wanna become famous
And doin' the same shit I do remain nameless
I want house money, jag money so I gots to bag money
I ain't laughin' but yo it's mad funny
I used to talk about that shit you got
But you ain't never got that shit when that shit get hot
Runnin' up in the spot with two niggaz from Israel
'Cause it is real you did squeal now how you think your kids feel?
Knowin' you died a snitch I look in yo' eyes and see a bitch
Wasn't surprised to see a switch
Let's make it quick I got a flight at six goin' to Pakistan
So let this nigga know I know he pussy I'ma smack his man
Fuckin' willie niggas and silly niggaz
I'd rather be eatin' of a plate
With all them Baltimore and philly niggaz
'Cause I done took about as much I can stand
A nigga smilin' in my face like they my motherfuckin' man
Aiyyo it gets a lot worse 'cause there's a curse
That says "The reward for bein' real is a hearse"
Before you turn thirty 'cause the dirty shit you did
Catches up and get you right when you thought you slid
It's gettin' dark and with the cold to the heart
You realize you ain't gonna see your shorty
Old enough to walk for real
X is comin' for ya, can't do nothin' for ya
'Cause X is comin' for ya
Run, hide, duck, duck
We don't give a fuck, fuck
X is comin' for ya, can't do nothin' for ya
'Cause X is comin' for ya
Run, hide, duck, duck
We don't give a fuck, fuck
