Load up your shit and get in the car [Come on, come on, come on.]. Come down to ride on these imposters, fake playa, gangsta thugs, and these hoes who claim they mobsters, 'cause they cloggin' up the game. Muthafuckas is rappin', sayin' anything, and tryin' to claim everythang to get they pockets paid. I'm tellin' 'em, "That's the wrong way!" Can't say you thuggin', then be fake--nigga, that's the point I'm tryin' state in this case. But niggas ain't feelin' me, though. So yo, I say we weed em' out and heat em' up. Heard you woofin'--yeah, we heard em'--let us see them nuts. And then if he really jump, more power to you. 
But no matter how it go, nigga we still gon' be bringin' it thug style to you--buckin'. Boo-yah! Checkin' these bustas do be kind of fun, because they know when it's static, we gon' handle it however it come, and nigga, whoever it's from--sure ain't givin' a fuck who you roll with. If they human, then they ain't shit we can't control. And if they bleed, and they need oxygen to breathe, nigga ya die. Never fear no man. No matter the size--the bigger, the harder they fall. Got somethin' for all of y'all, especially cocky, 'cause TEC'll chop him up--now he ain't half the man he thought he was. I bet these niggas think, "They rappin' so they actin'." So we come for a little target practice aimed exactly at you, exactly at you. 
Try me, if you're feelin' lucky and you think you wanna fuck with me, come on.

Walk through my city: I see niggas watchin'--probably plottin', schemin' to rob me, take all the money, and dump my bloody body. I'm sorry, not me. I stay alarmed and be alert. Whether you're goin' to play or work, make sure you got you pistol first--be ready to burst. Hesitation could bring up a fucked up situation like you leavin' in the body bag--zipped up, slip on that body tag. So if you spot him--blast. Better him than you, huh? I'm tellin' you now that me and my thugs can bring you anything that you want right out of the trunk. So, what's the bullshit? We got some shit you can't fuck with, and nigga that be this muthafuckin' thug shit. We love this--probably gon' die because of it. Fuck it! I ain't worried about dyin' right now, my money what's important. 
Hey, we livin' to die anyway--no matter if it's now or later. You gon' rest in peace; it don't get no greater. Kill 'em all, and when it's time to drop the mic and go pick up a rifle, time to fight for what we right for, see who really like war, yeah. I bet you most niggas lose as soon as they get in it. I can't afford to roll with bustas, 'cause I'm really tryin' win it [I'm really tryin' to win it.]. We fightin' to be victorious [victorious]. Witness the story of [story of] this silent, mighty, mighty, warrior [warrior]. If you hear any nigga move--shoot. Don't let the nigga layin' dead be you. So soldier, pick up you boots and move. Runnin' for cover, 'cause if they buck ya, it's over. Just like I told ya, you can die soldier, you can die soldier.
Try me, if you're feelin' lucky and you think you wanna fuck with me, come on.
