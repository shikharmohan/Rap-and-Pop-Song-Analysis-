Uhh, they don't wanna battle
They ain't ready for the battle, uh-uh, uh-uh temple of hip-hop
Listen, listen, listen
Your spirit ain't ready, your church ain't ready
Your bishop ain't ready, your deacons ain't ready
Your choir ain't ready, your ushers ain't ready
At the temple of hip-hop we teach many
Your spirit ain't ready, your church ain't ready
Your bishop ain't ready, your deacons ain't ready
Your choir ain't ready, your ushers ain't ready
At the temple of hip-hop we teach many
Look, to all my people hurtin', all my people searchin'
What we know for sure, God is always workin'
Workin' while you flirtin', workin' while you jerkin'
Workin' while the world is turnin' and these cities burnin'
God is always workin', workin' while you learnin'
Workin' while you ignorant and when you're not concernin'
Christ consciousness, get that, got that
Spit that, rock that, hip that, hop that
You sniff that? Stop that, I give back and got back
Greedy? I'm not that, you needy for that shock rap
Slangin' on the block rap, duckin' where the cops at
I don't know that, but Jesus done copped that
Not that man on the cross, it ain't like that
You must act like the son of God, that's where the lights at
Stop readin' only and start bein' show me
Like the resurrection I'll be back, they can't hold me
The spirit ain't ready, the church ain't ready
The bishop ain't ready, the deacons ain't ready
The choir ain't ready, the ushers ain't ready
At the temple of hip-hop we teach many
The spirit ain't ready, the church ain't ready
The bishop ain't ready, the deacons ain't ready
The choir ain't ready, the ushers ain't ready
At the temple of hip-hop we teach many
One thing's for sure and believe it hurt
It's when the pastor ain't sure, and deceives the church
They don't know God's law, and can't see God at work
So when they see hip-hop, they push it to the back of the church
Like fig trees or figures they don't bear fruit
They gospel artists, still tryin' to chase that loot
Hear the truth now, I come to enhance the light
They women of God, singin' while they pants is tight?
They not hot, really they, regular
They clothes they flows, all that, secular
What's the difference I could stay in the world and wild
If these church girls wear more makeup than destiny's child
Keep it real christian, some of y'all liftin' ain't likin'
But this is the difference between a christian and a christ-ian
Stop readin' only and start bein show me
Like the resurrection I'll be back, they can't hold me
Listen, listen, listen
Your spirit ain't ready, your church ain't ready
Your bishop ain't ready, your deacons ain't ready
Your choir ain't ready, your ushers ain't ready
At the temple of hip-hop we teach many
Your spirit ain't ready, your church ain't ready
Your bishop ain't ready, your deacons ain't ready
Your choir ain't ready, your ushers ain't ready
At the temple of hip-hop we teach many
Look, spiritual minded, you must find it
Find your spirit and go deep inside it
This goes out to the christ-ians listenin'
This is the flow that, gospel's missin' it's
Urban inspirational rap
We got our own section in the record stores, in our own rack
We respect tradition, from the start
But we now know, the true word of God is written in our heart
We gotta say somethin' to the streets kid
All these churches surroundin' the Devil still ain't defeat it?
They the type to get down, I'm the type to get up
From criminal to spiritual minded, now raise your head up
Let me start, these rappers ain't got God in they heart
All they want is quick money, and a movie part
Let me begin' what, where, why or when
What's the use of double platinum if you're livin' in sin
Hear the truth how long you think you gonna last
Rockin' the mic, without havin' to go back to class?
Now you're forced, to listen to the teacher outrap them
Yes there's life after platinum
