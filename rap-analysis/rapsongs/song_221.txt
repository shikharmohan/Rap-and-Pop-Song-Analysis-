Do you think about me?
Do you think about me?
Do you think about me?
Do you think about me?
You think about money when you think about me, huh
That's why my ex's my ex, you don't want to be her
She used to have the Beemer, now she own a sneaker
I had her eating lobster now she eating pizza
I think about Easter when I think about Keysha
Shorty stay fly, that's why I keep her
Round like the reefer, brown Mona Lisa
She good if I leave her, she got her own Visa
Think about them when you about frontin'
Think about stuntin' when you think about me
I'm the boss Bentley or the Porsche
Overseas see jet skis slide across
I love the way you dress, now take it off
Put your legs high on my shoulders across
I'm racing through your mind, but you already lost
I'm at the finish line and you're the friend of mine
Come on, let's ride
Just a lil' bit every now and then
Goddamn girl, we used to be friends
Just a lil' bit, just a lil' bit
Just a lil' bit, just a lil' bit
I think like a hustler, I'm thinking about a shipment
She thinking I'm her hustle, she thinking bout commitment
It's like Paul McCartney stuck in my head
He fell in love with a bitch, she walked away on one leg
She ain't even have to run to get away with the bread
That's some fucked up shit, think about that kid
I'm thinking what this bitch thinking when she take me to court?
I pay my child support, what the fuck she want?
This relationship, shit it's too much for me
I wanna fuck, be friends, and live comfortably
She wanna shine and blow minds on shopping sprees
She should have what she wants, just not for me
I'm thinking 'bout my future, she part of my past
She don't care 'bout me, she just want some cash
I'm thinking damn girl, we used to be friends
How did shit become all about M's?
Just a lil' bit every now and then
Goddamn girl, we used to be friends
Just a lil' bit, just a lil' bit
Just a lil' bit, just a lil' bit
Do you think about me?
I know you think about me
Just a lil' bit, just a lil' bit
Just a lil' bit, just a lil' bit
Do you think about me?
I know you think about me
You were so special to me
Do you think about me?
Do you think about me?
Do you think about me?
Do you think about me?
Do you think about me?
