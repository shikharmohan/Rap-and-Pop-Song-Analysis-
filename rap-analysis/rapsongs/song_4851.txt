It was Friday night
And I was feelin' aight, yep
Downtown Atlanta, big city, bright lights
Mixin' Henny wit tha Sprite
While I'm drinkin' and drivin'
No police lights, no police sirens
I'm headed to da club, lookin' for a freak
To spread a little love
And spread a couple cheeks
Pull up to da spot 26's like bam!
Eyes on me, like bitch, do you see 'em?
Stroll to da front do' headed to da VIP
Bought a couple bottles and I took a couple sips
Scopin' out da room and what do I see?
A nice round butt and a pair of double D's
So, I crept up like, Shawty what's happnin'?
You killin' that dress and I love it wit a passion
Then she turned around and her face was aight
She had a gap tooth and a mean overbite
But I was like hmm
If I take one more drink
I'm gon' end up fuckin' you
Is that what you wanna do shawty?
If I take one more drink
I'm gon' end up fuckin' you
You too
Woke up the next mornin' and all I can remember
Was takin' shots and tippin' a bartender
Surrender to da woman, and they're bringin' me home
Cause' she started lookin' better
Every shot of patron, yep!
I jumped up wit a devilish grin
Cause' tonight damn right, I might do it again!
So I called up da homies, whaddup?
Let's ride, we can hit the sportsbar
Over on the Southside
Get a couple of Coronas, couple of limes
Went up to da bar, and saw a couple of dimes
So I, slowly walked up and said hi
My name is Ludacris and I'mma hell of a guy
One said I know who you are, I'm your #1 fan
And right now is too bad, I got a man
And I said I understand, but where the hell is he at?
Cause' in a minute, if he don't show up, then man
If I take one more drink
I'm gon' end up fuckin' you
Is that what you wanna do shawty?
If I take one more drink
I'm gon' end up fuckin' you
You too
Ay Pain, holla at em right quick man!
Yeah, you gon' get in trouble with your man girl
(Don't get in trouble girl)
Talkin' bout how you're my biggest fan girl
(I know what I'm doin')
Now I don't wanna do
(Please)
What you gon make me do
(Don't make me do it, don't make me do it!)
If I had one more drink
One more drink I'mma get cha
Home, then I'll split cha
Grab the camera phone
And take a bunch drunk pictures
Cause' Hennessy mixed wit a whole bunch of buddha
Equals you, mixed with a whole bunch of Luda
And you know how far one drink could go
Start slurrin' my speech, slowin' up da flow
Hikin' up these skirts, climbin' up your shirt
It's Mr. Latenight Luda and I like to flirt
So guess what baby girl?
If I take one more drink
I'm gon' end up fuckin' you
Is that what you wanna do shawty?
If I take one more drink
I'm gon' end up fuckin' you
You too
You hear what I'm sayin'?
People too picky these days, damn it!
Too tall, too short, too fat, too skinny
Have a couple of drinks and quit discriminating
This has been a Luda Service Announcement
Deuces, ha ha ha
