Stand on the block Reebok gun cocked
Avalanche rock get paid off mass murderous services
Chef break 'em, watch the alley cats bake 'em
Watch the alley cats bake 'em
Four-nine made 'em, Jah create 'em take 'em
Quick fast we reflect like the sky be blue true
Wu-Tang saga continue
Grab Myer Lansky crashin' fantasy
Get high fellas, stand by, here's the plan, see?
Sit back collectin' Tecs N checks and
Blowin' slow in a Montaro flexin'
Beats break heavily word to INS bless me
Blow me like three bags of cess
For real from the Killa Hill locked and caged in
We're swarm representatives, reactin' like paid men
Strive for why's, nine lives in lies
Max sell and enjoy the highs, what
The treasure is the glaciers of ice
Orginal man possess the power to hold G's guns and grams
Caker baker pull off a keystone caper
Point out the baddest bitch in the crowd and I'm a scrape her
Proceed with caution as you enter the symphony
Degrees of pulse will increase intensely
Syndrome was caused by the deadly drums
But the battle was won by swords being swung
Slicing with a vocal from the international vocalist
Ya style is too local to fuck with this all fits of antagonists
No assistance movin' motionless mysterious swiftness
Thoughts roll down the shaft of the brain
Mental gives the signal to the physical
Whirlwind kicks and hits from every angle
Violent temperaments, uncountenance dented
Poison vintage wine rhymes I invented
Chumped by the drunken punches that punches the heart
Vital sparks from the arteries start
The treasure is the glaciers of ice original man
Possess the power of hold G's guns and grams
Straight up and down it's all good
Peace to them check castin' chain snatchin' gun flashin'
Niggaz in the hood bubblin' good
Analyze stocks, we'll be buyin' lion heads and cloths
To all my house bitches, starks will be home soon
I'm on tour chill, catch you ninety-six in June
But until then my ten-man team be safe
Chill on the whips to settle this, we can all get laced
Take a boat cruise, sip daiquiris and max swimmin' pools
Fly jewels Wally shoes blow stacks relax kid
Black kids got a cravin' for grapes until we get back
I'm packed leave the Mac that you're with
But whatever, I gotta hit other sides of the Earth
Spread Wuness, foolish, civilization's cursed
But luckily I'm born to be wild and aureal
Move crowds collect twenty thou and then we out
Heavy convoys my crew keep pretty boys paranoid
Blow like a steroid pat Dan's they're Akyroid
My seeds growin' his seeds marry his seeds
That's how we keep Wu-Tang money all up in the family
The treasure is the glaciers of ice
The treasure is the glaciers of ice
The treasure is the glaciers of ice
Original man possess the power to hold G's guns and grams
Caker baker pull off a keystone caper
Point out the baddest bitch in the crowd and I'm a scrape her
My seeds growin' his seeds marry his seeds
That's how we keep Wu-Tang money all up in the family
It's been a long time
This is the time
It's been a long time
Says Wu-Tang had the chance to shine
It's been a long time
It's been a long time
It's been a long time
