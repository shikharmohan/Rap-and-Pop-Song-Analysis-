Shhh, they're about to start the movie
[Intro]
And, hear ye, hear ye
Disturbing Tha Peace presents, "Theater of the Mind"
Get your popcorn, get your popcorn
You scoot over to the left a little bit
Single file line now
It's an extravagant event starring Ludacris
Please silence all cell phones
We're about to go on a ride!
Let the show beginnnnnn!
[Ludacris]
Lights, camera, annnnnd
ACTION! Take 6, Ludacris, it's nice to meet ya
Blow the smoke in the air 'til I blow out your brain
Turn it up until I blow out your speakers
Gotta keep them Tweeters tweakin, gotta keep them woofers pumpin
Then I blow out one of these verses
Spit 'em in ya, got a million more comin
However you want it, I can give it but you gotta admit it
Other rappers talk it, try to walk it, Luda live it
Sign it and seal it, multi-mil' it, said it and did it
They give me sixteen bars on another nigga's song
and you know that I'ma FUCKIN KILL IT
Cause I'm the FUCKIN realest, when it comes to this rappin sheeit
Semi-automatic tongue when I spit another verse cock back, I'm packin beeitch
And I'm back and attackin with album six
Tell them other niggaz we see danger
Probably cause I got enough, albums to fill yo' CD changer
Gotta buy my whole collection, gotta beat my whole selection
Hit your neighborhood record sto', and you can get it in the smokin section
Now that's a coke connection, these fiends are addicted to it
No guts no glory, so that's my story and I'm STICKIN to it
That's my story and I'm stickin to it
Here's my story and I'm stickin to it
Here's my story and I'm stickin to it
Here some stories and I'm stickin to it
Annnnnd CUT! On a good gate we're movin on
