Yup, I shakes my butt, shakes my gut like 'yeah bitch, what?'
Yeah I likes it rough, tough ask ya man how I'm good in handcuffs
Me and Nelly came to rock the club, pack the place, don't push and shove
I'm from the club straight to the crub, I'll let ya know if the sex was good
Pump it up! show me love, chick

  (This is how me and Nelly pump it up)
Oh, show me love, chick

Pump it up! Let me see those big ass hips
Pump it up! Big booty, pump it up
Down south players, we got that fire, man
Get up on my booty, tootie fruite on the rudy

No matter what the size, my big thighs, I do my duty
Look at the way my rump like shake like a movie
See my tight jeans and the coochie
Spend a little loochie, gotta work for the booty
Me and Nelly hot on the track, Nelly, can't no one ever top that
'Cause we came to rock the club, DJ's betta pump it up
Mother fuckers need to back it up
'Cause we gonna tear the roof off the club
Pump it up! show me love, chick

Pump it up! Let me see those big ass hips
Pump it up! Big booty, pump it up..
You know down south chicks got big asses
And we a little heavy sometimes
But when you from the south, we don't call that 'fat'
We call that 'big-boneded', for show
Yeah ma, I heard you like the magic stick
Me I got that gadget stick, it's like go-go gadget dick
You know, make her climb the walls shit
I make her wanna press pause and shit
Walk up in the party, girls swingin' they panties
You see they was doin' that before I had them Grammy's
I get a little baby when I'm in Miami
I may act a little fresh but I still got mannies
It's Nelly phelony, and Missy, misdemeanor
Both goin' down, [Incomprehensible]
Check the records we got, records that broke
Records in record time and I aint talkin' 'bout the records they buyin'
Lyin', kid ya need to keep up with me
You see I'm still spendin' [Incomprehensible], stackin' the ride with me
You struggle to recoup, I struggle on which coupe to ride in
See how we be stylin'
Pump it up! show me love, chick
Pump it up! Let me see what you workin' with
Come on pump it up! Let me see those big ass hips
Pump it up! Booty, pump it up
  (This is how me and Nelly pump it up)
Oh, show me love, chick
Pump it up! Let me see what you workin' with
Pump it up! Let me see those big ass hips
Pump it up! Big booty, pump it up.
This is fire, this is fire, this is fire
