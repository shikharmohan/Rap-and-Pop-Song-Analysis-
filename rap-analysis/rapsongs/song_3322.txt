Dont Hate The Playa Lyrics:[intro: too $hort]
Yeah man we just sittin back, chillin
Bunch of players listenin to the seventh deadly sin
Short dawg is doin his thing with my nigga ice-t
Dont fake the funk
[ice-t]
Ice-t baby, this goes out to all you haters out there
Actin like a brother done did somethin wrong
Cause he got his game tight
Dont hate the player, hate the game
[chorus: ice-t]
Dont hate the player, hate the game
Niggas, sharpen your aim
Every baller on the streets is searchin fortune and fame
Some come up, some get done up, except the twist
If you out for mega cheddar, you got to go high risk
[ice-t]
Sometimes I get illy, cock back the nine-milli
I choose not to bust, smack your punk-ass silly
Just bought a crib, it cost two-point-five milli
Swimming pool in my livin room, I guess ima willy
I dont get high, so I dont split the phillies
Niggas say they gonna kill me and I say: "oh really? "
Hit my kawazakie I pull off on a willy
This is straight-lace pimpin, I know you hoes feel me
I come through - make your whole club petrol
You might as well let go, I blast, make the whole cub echo
You dont really wannna test an l.a. vet though
Most of my crews on death row - the real!!
Quick with the trigger, nice with the steel
Step into the kill zone caps get peeled
You whack!! you lookin for a record deal
Bow down, on second thought punk bitch kneel
[chorus: ice-t]
Dont hate the player, hate the game
Niggas, sharpen your aim
Every baller on the streets is searchin fortune and fame
Some come up, some get done up, except the twist
If you out for mega cheddar, you got to go high risk
Dont hate the player, hate the game
Niggas, sharpen your aim
Eve
