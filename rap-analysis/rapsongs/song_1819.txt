Rapper and actor DMX along with wife pregnant wife Tashera
Showed up at the Federal Court in Queens, Wednesday
To accept a plea agreement
Inside the courthouse
DMX signed autographs with a sketch artist over the face
As well as the fans caught off guard
By this star's appearances
My baby motha be buggin' soon as I walk in the door
Got me like, "You ain't messin' with that chick no more"
Shorty, crazy, so I can't deal with her
Thinkin' 'cause we got a kid together, I'm still with her
My baby motha be buggin' soon as I walk in the door
Got me like, "You ain't messin' with that chick no more"
Shorty, crazy, so I can't deal with her
Thinkin' 'cause we got a kid together, I'm still with her
My baby's motha be buggin', she one of 'em plastic ***
One of them talk *** and then get they *** kicked ***
Once upon a time, y'all *** know the story
And that everythin' is lovely when it's all about the glory
But soon as *** hit the fan
Honies be wanna take the kid and scram
I'm havin' bad thoughts
Don't like how dark it's gettin', man
From the time I wake up and get dressed
I get stressed and hardly ever get rest
It's O-5, so I'm on some different *** cousin
She ain't gon' have me listenin'
Through that riffin' *** cousin
I got moves to make and mad *** to do
Her friends are lookin' good, so I might hit the crew
It's like one and two that might get a *** that big and happy
And I know them *** me
'Cause when I see 'em, they be winkin' at me
You listenin' thinkin', "That's a crazy brother"
But I'm gon' have to be a father
Who ain't *** with his baby motha
My baby motha be buggin' soon as I walk in the door
Got me like, "You ain't messin' with that chick no more"
Shorty, crazy, so I can't deal with her
Thinkin' 'cause we got a kid together, I'm still with her
My baby motha be buggin' soon as I walk in the door
Got me like, "You ain't messin' with that chick no more"
Shorty, crazy, so I can't deal with her
Thinkin' 'cause we got a kid together, I'm still with her
*** be callin' the cops, thinkin' they callin' the shots
Takin' the dude with the bag, baby, it's all in the pops
And do yo' thing 'cause I'm doin' mine, boo
A *** just been chillin', I been doin' fine and you?
I kicked it with my honey and she put me on to somethin'
You gon' think until you really see me gone, I'm frontin'
Maybe if you kept your friends some respectable distance
Out of our business, I wouldn't have to come and visit
I thought you knew, let the *** you like switchin' clothes
When them *** through, ain't [too co] sure when they ***
But that ain't never stopped yo' ass from passin' on the Guess
Askin' for that Cougie sweater, paddin' up the breast
Paddin' up the butt but you think *** is stupid
Last week yo *** was like the dog but look at it now, too big
I ain't gon' blow yo' *** no more, I shouldn't be even did that
'Cause you my baby motha and I'ma always hit that
Give a hell what you say
I ain't never gon' go away
I'ma stalk you 'til I find you
Turn around and be right behind you
Be in the bushes outside your house
Just waitin' for you to come out
'Cause I'm a stupid b***
A real *** stupid b***
Ain't nothin' but a stupid b***
My baby motha be buggin' soon as I walk in the door
Got me like, "You ain't messin' with that chick no more"
Shorty, crazy, so I can't deal with her

Shorty, crazy, so I can't deal with her
Thinkin' 'cause we got a kid together, I'm still with her
My baby motha be buggin' soon as I walked in the door
Got me like I ain't f*** with that b*** no more
Give me a Puerto Rican honey that cooks rice and beans
And hair down to her ***, who looks nice in jeans
So I can be like "Damn, you lookin' good and I wanna what"
But you a chicken, so when I'm finish, I got a duck
Plus, you don't wanna be around and see what honey do
And plenty comin' through, she comin' through with that 22
Trust me, you don't need that in your life
Oh, y'all b*** already know, I got a wife
You'se a stupid b***, a real *** stupid b***
You ain't nothin' but a stupid b***
Give a hell what you say
I ain't never gon go away
I'ma stalk you 'til I find you
Turn around and be right behind you
Be in the bushes outside your house
Just waitin' for you to come out
'Cause I'm a stupid b***
A real *** stupid b***
Ain't nothin' but a stupid b***
