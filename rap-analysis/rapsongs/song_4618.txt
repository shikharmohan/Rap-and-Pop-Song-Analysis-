Hey, hey, this some grown man shit right here
Take it slow
Yeah, take it slow
Listen
I'm trying to man up see what's really good with you
Gentleman's approach, not bring it hood to you
Same things that you hear everyday like
Hey ma, hey boo, baby, what's your name?
Please pull up a seat, I'm so glad you came
My mother call me Thomas, you can do the same
Damn it's so refreshing when you calling out my name
Been Pooh for so long it doesn't sound the same
My occupation rap and I make a little change
I see you not impressed with what this life brings
Finished school, got a job, girl do your thing
It's a lot of independent women wanna be claimed
Marry into money or marry into fame
Or at least give birth to a check
With all due respect, let's two step in the name of like
Who says we gotta do the waltz all day and all night? It's like
If love is not enough, we don't have to rush
Come around, I'll slow it down just for you
Lady, you should be right here next to me
Come around, I'll slow it down just for you
We can go to the movies, I'll take you to the park
And promise to have you home before the lights go out
Steady, asking you questions what your life about
Oh and me, mine's everything I scribe about
No doubt this my life
And dedicated to this witting sacrificing
Everything for it wasted time, I can't afford
So if it ain't you and then you know I'm cooped up to the record
I'll scoop you up in me Porsches, 'ike, you know I got a Nissan
That I'm still paying for, still got a lease on
But it don't matter 'cause that ain't my aim to get you
I got fame but you know that just ain't the issue
Because you're looking like a woman of virtue
So well rounded, no wonder you're in my circle
And normally you probably wouldn't give me the time of day
'Cause Tay got rhymes but no he ain't got time to waste
Let's do it now darlin'
If love is not enough, we don't have to rush
Come around, I'll slow it down just for you
Lady, you should be right here next to me
Come around, I'll slow it down just for you
Sometimes I think I'm from another world
(Preach)
When I'm trynna tell a woman just exactly where I stand at
(Aight)
I want a girl when I want a girl
And when I don't want a girl, I want a girl who understands that
And that's some hard shit to explain
To a woman that's in love with you, it's a pitiful thing
Until I had to figure that I don't wanna play around
But I don't wanna settle down
And that's a man's dilemma
'Cause every man remembers
How his daddy and his uncles did it
'Cause more than likely that's the way they're gonna do it
I know it sound fucked up and most won't admit it
But yo, I gotta face it 'cause I know I'm living through it
'Cause when the party stops and niggaz get old
And the chain and the cars and the houses get sold
And that other side of the bed gets cold
You don't wanna be alone so girl, I'm trynna hold you
If love is not enough, we don't have to rush
Come around, I'll slow it down just for you
Lady, you should be right here next to me
Come around, I'll slow it down just for you
Oh, baby
(Take it slow, take it slow, take it slow, take it slow)
What you need to do is take it slow with me
Slow it down a little bit
(Take it slow, take it slow, take it slow, take it slow)
We don't have to rush into anything serious
  (Take it slow, take it slow, take it slow, take it slow)
No, we don't, take it from me
(Take it slow, take it slow, take it slow, take it slow)
My name is Percy and I make miracles
If you take it slow with me, baby
  (Take it slow, take it slow, take it slow, take it slow)
