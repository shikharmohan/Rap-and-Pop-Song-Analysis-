She don't wear draws,
She like her pussy raw,
And she don't like pets,
But she cool with my dawgs,
And she cook a nigga steak,
She fix a nigga plate,
She rub a nigga back,
Like I'm in the NBA,
And she know I'm in the game,
But she know I don't play,
And she know just what ta do ta make me say "I'm gone stay",
She know gotta work,
And she know I got work,
She buy my socks, box-ers, and t-shirts
She know gotta work,
And she know I got work,
She buy my socks, box-ers, and t-shirts
