I'mma lil mannish muthafucka
I take out them older brothas
Started out sellin' marijauna
But now I'm sellin' yola
Shit was gettin' hella funky at first
When a nigga was snatchin' up bitches purse
Ended up gettin' kicked up outta school in Vallejo
They clocked me like a circus
(Like a circus?)
I was the 'lil mannish mufucka showin' out in the back of the church
My momma was quick to hit me witta switch and I'd say that hurts
Get to the house, start some shit and start some trash
I never believed a hard head made a soft ass
'Cause I be movin' fast and I be tryin'na stash
Beat up the pizza man and I straight dash
Disobedient sports cut my days short
My mama got tired of takin' my ass back and forth to court
I said momma I'mma straighten up for you and I promise that I'mma work
Got me a job as a paper boy, 21 dollars a month
5 o'clock in the morning, damn I'm slavin' for the fuckin' white man
21 dollars might buy me some porage call me chicken George
I'm tired of muthafuckas fuckin' over me
How can I find a way to make some real money?
But you don't feel me, I was tired of being broke lookin' tore down
I came up off a twenty dollar break me down
Next thang you know, I was up to about a quarter of a key ballin'
Niggaz wuz trippin' off me cause I was a young muthafucka ballin'
Gettin' my fetti on but when it was funk I had to stall
Time to go get them choppers and bring out the u-haul
I'm extra mannish-I make ya vanish-I play for keeps
Investigate that ass till I find out where you sleep
Muthafucka, I'm Kamikaze-don't even try me I
Bars nuttin', best believe that I'mma bring the uh
Fully automatic tommy with the info red and say I'm sorry
Before I pump yo ass fulla lead and dump the body
"Extra mannish" thats what people be callin' me
Oh we can be cool until you gets to threatenin' me
I lose my temper and shit, my eyes turn red
Blow my top and get real hot at the head
I guess I'mma failure, I got no future in my frontin'
All I'm able to do is sell dope and hit the blunt
Don't ask me why? Sometimes I go to church and testify
The preacher preaches and I be dang near ready to cry
Rebuke the devil, I gotta get up out the ghetto free
Sometimes I wonder if mommy and daddy was ever payin' me
Who would ever think that a nigga like me
Would become such a bad ass youngster?
My mommy and daddy done fucked around and created a damn monster
Why didn't I wait till I was bigger, before I started drinkin' malt liquor?
I guess I was a nappy headed stubborn 'lil mannish ass nigga
Guess who comes thru
(who?)
Its me the Y O U N G M U T Z
I'm just as mannish as I wanna be I pack a 30-30
Niggaz wanna blast me because I'm down and dirty
Extra mannish is how I'm livin' and I'm fuckin' my neighbors bitch and
She's lovin' every minute of the dick that I be givin'
Bitches on my jock bitches on my jock
Niggaz on the block know I got a glock
Bean cocks, Pecos, and all that
I'm beatin niggaz down witta baseball bat
I'm not the revenues, I'm gettin' paid fool
A ghetto muthafucka witta attitude
S I C K W I T I T
It's Young Mutz and E-40
This explains why its hard for us blacks and Hispanics
And why we turn extra mannish
