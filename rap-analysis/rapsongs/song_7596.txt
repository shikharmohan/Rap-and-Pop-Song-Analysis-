[Dee Money Verse 1]
I relate to niggaz and they relate to me
Real niggas do real things thats how it supposed to be
Cut from the same clothes make the same shirt
Probably had the same glock and got the same worth
I'll whack ya ass and skip to da N.O
And lay low in the projects with my kin-folk 
AK-47 with the shoulder strap Set it off had it sounded 
like the Nolia clap Got 2 strikes nigga dodgin the 
P.O,P.O's This real life leave ya brains in da thresh hole
I a street nigga mayne pimpin ain't easy leave da block
silent holla at em Jeezy.

[Young Jeezy Verse 2]
It's my style They jockin my slang 
Im a real street nigga 
We ain't the same nigga Im grown nigga
So play wit your own kids I'm a street nigga
I was born in da streetz kid One white girl left
Save the last dance My partner said you want it
Well this your last chance Funny how a Murder can get u 50 years
Like a Co-defendent makin deals like he work at Sears
Still posted like a stripper dawg
Judge gettin mo money then a stripper dawg
Play the game how it go nigga running niggsz quicker then a
kitchen sink dirty south nigga on my way 2 da bank
