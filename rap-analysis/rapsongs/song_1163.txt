I'll admit, I was a wild seed when I was a kid
Slangin' dope, poppin' Shroomz and droppin' lots of sin
Psychedelic visions would ensue my view
Feelin' the alter-states as they altered my fate
But I [Incomprehensible], all that distorted shit brought it up
I came short and couldn't afford to store it up
So I began to record it on audio
The autobiography of Luis Mario
Somethin' that's unbelievable, inconceivable
That half the shit I set out to do was achievable
But alas, look at all the shit come to pass
While we remained strong, others broke like glass
'Cause you lack style, and you need all the help brother
'Cause you're fragile, and it should say it on your cover
This side up, for the celebrity
Who lacks intelligence, integrity, intensity
Oh, it's true, I got you in an angle like Kurt
But don't go gettin' your fuckin' feelin's hurt
I spit many bars of heat, that burn like a furnace
I pour rhymes out like coffee spillin' out your dermis
I got my 9 millimeter at my waist, papa
I got my shotgun in the escalade, papa
If you feel groggy then jump and get sprayed, papa
I don't wanna but you dug your own grave, papa
I got my 9 millimeter at my waist, papa
I got my shotgun in the escalade, papa
If you feel groggy then jump and get sprayed, papa
I don't wanna but you dug your own grave, papa
You know me and you've grown with me
And if I had a big enough pad, I'd take you all home with me
I don't walk around with bodyguards, that's not me
I'm hangin' out with the people of my posse
Used to have a lot of enemies with bad intentions
Spreadin' gossip like disease, creatin' lots of tension
People turn around when you become a star it seems
But others hate you all 'cause you've fulfilled all your dreams
They smile in your face and act like nothin's wrong
When you turn your back, they hate, and play one of your songs
Why don't you take your mask off, look me in the eye?
You afraid I might blast-off and call you on your life?
Take a deep one, and peep son
Retribution comes around more than once, like a re-run
You're a cheap one to kill, so steep son
You're just another one who gets thrown in the quay, son
I got my 9 millimeter at my waist, papa
I got my shotgun in the escalade, papa
If you feel groggy then jump and get sprayed, papa
I don't wanna but you dug your own grave, papa
I got my 9 millimeter at my waist, papa
I got my shotgun in the escalade, papa
If you feel groggy then jump and get sprayed, papa
I don't wanna but you dug your own grave, papa
You know they smile in your face
You know they try to take space
I let you punks know you ain't safe
'Cause you know you're just dead-weight
But at the present day they gettin' stalled out for some reason
But not from me, because it's punk-hunt season
Charged with high-treason, I'm easin' the blow never
[Incomprehensible], that you're leasin', ain't gonna roll forever
So think about that, is it worth the pain?
When you flirt with pain, bitch you don't hurt your brain
But you're thick-headed, numskull and rick said it
"It was the moment you feared, when my venom spreaded"
I got my 9 millimeter at my waist, papa
I got my shotgun in the escalade, papa
If you feel groggy then jump and get sprayed, papa
I don't wanna but you dug your own grave, papa
I got my 9millimeter at my waist, papa
I got my shotgun in the escalade, papa
If you feel groggy then jump and get sprayed, papa
I don't wanna but you dug your own grave, papa
You know they smile in your face
You know they try to take space
I let you punks know you ain't safe
You know they just can't wait
You know they smile in your face
You know they try to take space
I let you punks know you ain't safe
You know they just can't wait
