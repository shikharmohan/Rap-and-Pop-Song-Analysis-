Diamonds are foreverÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
They are... all I need to please me
They canÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ stimulate and tease me
They won't leave in the night,
have no fear that they might... desert me
[chorus]
Diamonds are forever: Throw ya diamonds in the sky if ya feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever: The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever, ever ever, ever ever, ever ever, ever ever, ever ever, ever everÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
Good morning, this ain't Vietnam, still
people lose hands, legs, arms for real
Little was known of Sierra Leone,
and how it connects to the diamonds we own
When I speak of diamonds in this song,
I ain't talking bout the ones that be glowin',
I'm talking bout Rocafella, my home,
my chain, these ain't conflict diamonds, is they Jacob?
Don't lie to me man
See a part of me saying keep shining, how?
When I know of the blood diamonds,
Though it's thousands of miles away,
Sierra Leone connect to what we go through today
Over here it's a drug trade, we die from drugs
Over there, they die from what we buy from drugs
The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets the charms's
I thought my Jesus piece was so harmless
till I seen a picture of a shorty armless
and here's the conflict - it's in a black person soul to rock that gold
Spend ya whole life trying to get that ice
On that polo rugby it look so nice,
how could something so wrong make me feel so right, right?
Before I beat myself up like Ike
You can still throw ya Rocafella diamond tonight
because...
[chorus]
People asking me if I'm gone give my chain back *Unh*
That'll be the same day I give the game back *Unh*
You know the next question dog, yo where Dame at? *Unh*
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign/rain back *Whoo*
What's up with you and Jay man, is y'all okay man?
Jay-Z:
Yup! I got it from here 'Ye (yay), damn.
The chain remains, the gang is intact
The name is mine, I'll take blame for that
The pressures on, but guess who ain't gon' crack? 
*Ha Ha* Pardon me, I had to laugh at that
How could you falter?
When you're the Roc of Gibraltar
I had to get off the boat so I could walk on water
This ain't no tall order, this is nothing to me
Difficult takes a day, impossible takes a week
I do this in my sleep, I sold kilo's of coke
(So) I'm guessing I can sell CD's
I'm not a businessman,
I'm a business, man!
Let me handle my business, damn
Kanye, he got me,
Freeway and Foxy,
YGz, Teira Marie, Peedi watch me
Bleek could be one hit away ya whole career
As long as I'm alive, he's a millionaire
And even if I die, he's in my will somewhere
So he can just kick back and chill some where, oh yeah
He won't even have to write rhymes,
The dynasty, like my money last three lifetimes
Shirley Bassey's in the rear saying exactly what I been saying practically my whole career
The diamond is forever, I been mining this forever
Now the Louis Vuitton Don's timing couldn't be better
People lined up to see the Titanic sinking
stead we rose from the ash like a phoenix
If ya waiting for the end of the dynasty sign
It would seem like forever is a mighty long time! 
I'm. Young. Bitches.
Goodnight!
