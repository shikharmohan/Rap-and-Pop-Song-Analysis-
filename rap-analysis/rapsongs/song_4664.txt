I met this new girl with big juicy lips
An' nice round hips, I mean her body's a trip
An' when I go over her house, you know what I like?
The way she tells me take it off an' never says syke
Yo, I'm never in need, she's feedin' my greed
She never waits for me to ask, she takes the lead
Her tongue is sticky an' hickeys are her specialty
E wants her, but she saves the good stuff for me
Her name is Kanday, she's dandier than Dandy Don
You're mad an' I'm happy that she put me on
I'll never leave her for nothin', only a crazy man would
That's why I had to tell ya that
I feel good about Kanday
I feel good about Kanday
I feel good
Now an' Laters, gum drops, jellybeans
Brothers beg for the leg, she's on the cheerleadin' team
It feels wicked, every time I stick it, that's right
When we're alone, she never ever acts polite
Hey, yo, she blows me kisses, she does my dishes
I wished I bust two an' she grants my wishes
She's clever in bed, she uses her head
She's the kinda girl that keeps a fat man well fed
Left to right all night, the chick's outta sight
I broke my lamp shade in half because I don't use a light
Man, she's juicy like a berry, chocolate with the cherry
Ask me if it's good an' I'll have to say very
Wouldn't leave her for nothin', only a crazy man would
That's why I had to tell ya that
I feel good about Kanday
I feel good about Kanday
I feel good
I'm feelin' gooder than good, if you wouldn't, I would
If you could, I know you could, she's kickin' back in the hood
When she starts to get off, she can knock off a cough
I know cough don't rhyme with boss, but she made me her boss
She's the talk of my room, whenever I'm in my room
My little brother loves her more than his favorite cartoon
Her body's bad, the girl's built, skin like silk
Wet, steamy an' warm just like a hot cup of milk
She's all the way live, keeps me satisfied
I don't go outside, I like to stay inside
Her ways are like a angel, with bright white wings
An' I'm crazy 'bout the way Kanday shakes her thing
Wouldn't leave her for nothin', only a crazy man would
That's why I had to tell ya that
I feel good about Kanday
I feel good about Kanday
I feel good
Ooh, you couldn't imagine, I'm lickin' my lips
If she was tea I'd take a sip, when I'm in gym, I do flips
I'm in love with the pizznoot, it's proper as hell
I'm hittin' harder than hard, always makin' her yell
She's cooler than an iceberg, word to the mother
In the house, down the steps an' under the covers
Right away, no sation, or frontin', or playin'
Or delayin', I'm never steppin' off, I'm always stayin'
Her mother knows me well, father hates my guts
He don't know when we're alone
She's always feelin' on my niggy, niggy nuts
For a snack, cornflakes, crackerjacks
Day after day I try to break that back
An' man, oh man, damn, you can't an' I can
Last time I saw her with man I had to shake almost hands
I said, "What up?" He said, "What up?"
"I took your girl, so what up?"
Gotta walk on the ground with a hole to fill up
All the boys laugh about her, Darryl an' Dewayne
Bobcat an' Earl, but they must be insane
Michael Spelling's on my side, an' Big Chuck, the Grease
She's my private freaky deak, my own personal skeez
Wouldn't leave her for nothin', only a crazy man would
That's why I had to tell ya that
I feel good about Kanday
I feel good about Kanday
I feel good about Kanday
I feel good about Kanday
I feel good
