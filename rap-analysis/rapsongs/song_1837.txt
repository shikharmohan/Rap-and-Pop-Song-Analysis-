They're back
This is what you're tellin' me? Okay
It all comes down to this huh? Okay
This is what you fuckin' tellin' me?
That this is it? Okay
How many slugs should I plug into your chest before it's get filled?
Since you ain't got nothin' else to do but get killed
Been a fiend every since I found out how a slaughter taste
Empty a clip of hollow tips into your daughter's face
'Cause that's just the type of shit that I'm on
Collect my dough make the fuckin' hit and I'm gone
I ain't never gots to worry about the aim
Infrared to your head will make sure I hit him in the brain
Fly one more time for good luck
For what? He was already dead, what the fuck?
I be breakin' my shit up off in a nigga
When I don't see nothin' but soft in a nigga
Fuckin' coward I wonder how it feels
To have to look at your moms squeal after I hit her with the steel
Ill that's how a nigga blows shit up believe whoever I hit up will never get up
Tell me how it's goin' down nigga if I'm bein' a fuckin' clown nigga
Take a couple of rounds nigga, I keep a toast real close
In case I gotta turn the rest of your peeps into ghosts
Fuck it I'm ready for combat with a gat
That'll make any nigga become a meal for the fuckin' rats
There won't be nothin' left of money but a soup bone
Big motherfuckin' DMX from the group home
Niggaz don't mean what they say when they talk
Niggaz lean a certain kind of way when they walk
Niggaz don't mean what they say when they talk
Niggaz lean a certain kind of way when they walk
So, since the first day in it I made a promise to myself
I was gonna make it happen that's the way I felt
You know Philly never scared play the cards we dealt
Doin' it my way you bitches strugglin' for help
I hear your rumors and your so called beefs
But it's a different story any time we meet in the streets
I'm fully in it bitch your shit is juvenile to me
We can squash it go head let you warm up the crowd for me
I hate to even be like this you all bring it out
To tell the truth it excites me I scream it out
Sick wid' it ain't a bitch that can get wid' it
Admit it I'm that bitch you can't live wid' it
And I'ma keep it comin' long as I'm here
Pitbull back at ya neck I'm hearin' them cheer
E V E is what they need in they life I'm bout mine
Now I'm done with you fuck out my face wastin' my time
Bitches don't mean what they say when they talk
Bitches lean a certain kind of way when they walk
Bitches don't mean what they say when they talk
Bitches lean a certain kind of way when they walk
Yeah, aiyyo, I got a wet haze coke and a P-blow block
But you all still missin' the point like a free throw shot
Get it this ain't some you learn this is some you earn
Turn it up and give me some to burn
That boy kiss is a hell of a man
Treat your life like a cell phone so try to get a hell of a plan
'Cause most dudes left the hood broke
A couple knew what they was doin' so they came back like good coke
Down south they'll tell you, kiss is good folk
Up north I hit my niggaz off with good smoke
Out west they ridin' with me now I'm back hard
I'm just worried 'bout the rats that's in my back yard
Hated by many, confronted by none
I trust two guys one's God and one is my gun
Jada is the nice guy, Kiss is the monster
D-Block and double R is my sponsor
Cowards don't mean what they say when they talk
Cowards lean a certain kind of way when they walk
Cowards don't mean what they say when they talk
Cowards lean a certain kind of way when they walk
Fuckin' cowards
Niggaz can't be fuckin' serious you all niggaz pussy
Niggaz pussy you all don't like it bring it, bitch
Just a little someone man to let you all know
To niggaz know man matter of fact
Matter of fact you all niggaz excuse my back man?
Straight up you all niggaz pardon my back
I ain't got no rap for no sucka ass niggaz
Five time motherfuckin' champ
Five time, bitch, touch that, then holla back
Motherfucker
A nigga had this rap shit
I'm out
