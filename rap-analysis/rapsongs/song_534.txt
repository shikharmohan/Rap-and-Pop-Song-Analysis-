Bone Thugs back and you're gonna be in trouble
Bone Thugs back and you're gonna be in trouble
Bone Thugs back and you're gonna be in trouble
Bone Thugs back and you're gonna be in trouble
We keep it goin', get it for the Mid West
Krayzie, Layzie, Bizzy, Wish
We can't forget about Flesh
We finna drop another bomb
We figure they can't take another rhyme
Come back off and get 'um with another platinum rhythm
And they won't fuck in the lab
They want to try to keep up so come on
Thirty million sold and that I'll just stay
At that now what about that, listen to the thuggish
And listen to every other rapper rap about
Who that come from talkin' Bone fell off
Say what they bust, just like us
They ain't even knowin' where it came from like richer niggas
They ain't going to give it to us so we gon' take it
We just come to tell you that Bone Thugs back and we still creepin'
Bone Thugs back and you're gonna be in trouble
Bone Thugs back and you're gonna be in trouble
Bone Thugs back and you're gonna be in trouble
Bone Thugs back and you're gonna be in trouble
Guess who's back
Guess who's back

Now tell me how many thugs get down like us
And still harmonize like the great Temptations
Sit back, look back, lame in the game
Came right back
(Back)
With no hesitation
Put up yo money, honey, what ever ya got we won't lose
Put up or shut up
Get slapped in front of all your dogs
And all your dudes
'Cause I'm a smarter thug all ways wanted to be a thug
What do you think?
Do you think he gon' do something?
Don't let the money fool you
Don't let the money do you
'Cause it ain't really about nothin'
(Nothin')
It's just so much they gon' let in
Toss that we gon' show you who you are messin' with
That's why I started a war in this rap game
You got to hit hard
And let them now who they dealin' with
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Bone Thugs back and you're gonna be in trouble

When we meet on the concrete jungle
We can do it, we can rumble
Take it to the streets
And let the whole world crumble
All I ever seen was heavy smoke in the air
Bustin' heavy shots
They just don't care
If you don't then I'm goin' to get all tha bloodiness
Niggas want peace but I know they all gon' test us
The thugs commin' back to bring the thug essence
Thugs commin' back to bring back the thug blessin's
For the Lord where doin' to fight the wind
I'ma fight to get them all hyped again
Tell the Bone Thug story again
If a nigga still hatin' a pipe again
Like I did before, creep, creep and I came
Just four more niggas down for there thang
Never been afraid to let my nuts hang
How to you think Bone Thug made it to the top of the game nigga
Bone Thugs back and you're gonna be in trouble
Bone Thugs back and you're gonna be in trouble
Bone Thugs back and you're gonna be in trouble
Bone Thugs back and you're gonna be in trouble
Fully automatic loaded, Remy Martin fill my potion
Coastin' on freeways, keep rollin' 'til we hit the ocean
Motion on freeways 'bout to bustin' on niggas bastion
Popi Cholos solo with my pistol so smokin'
Pullin' pop up bitch nigga if you talkin'
Tokin', tortin' with my pistol
Got you people open, these niggas is enemies
Shots up in they body, never was friend to me
Pass me the Hennessy, hey
Bone Thugs back and you're gonna be in trouble
Who the thugs with the wickedest rhymes
Wickedest rhymes, wickedest rhymes?
Who the thugs with the wickedest rhymes
