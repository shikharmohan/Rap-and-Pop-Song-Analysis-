Yeah, let it go, yo, that's right
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, check it out, tell 'em, dunn
Y'all niggaz can't fuck wit the niggaz I fuck wit
Really don't wanna fuck wit niggaz I fuck wit
Y'all niggaz minor league in my eyes for real
Y'all niggaz wanna pop shit? See me when ya get a record deal
Y'all niggaz can't fuck wit the niggaz I fuck wit
Really don't wanna fuck wit niggaz I fuck wit
Y'all niggaz minor league in my eyes for real
Y'all niggaz wanna pop shit? See me when ya get a record deal
Yo, if I sat at wrote a verse for all the niggaz I hated
Most definitely, if not you, kill somebody belated
Sound foul with a subject, dunn, no women or kids
Dump you up under a bridge in a cardboard box
I'm like nothin' to do wit it, believe it or not
I'm washin' my hands to get bent with Henney or rock
Up in the rep, bangin' my chest off, pealin' my socks
Niggaz do it to death, I sleep with my 6 cocked
I can't rock, one sip, ya love it a lot
While you sleepin', I'm creapin' wit the intricate plot
'Cuz picture me up in the morgue, way before my time
Picture you tryin' to get me while I'm still tryin' to get mines
Asshole, have ya brain lookin' like Castro
Dunn, I heard you wanted me, be careful what you ask for
Bitch, if I buck you, damn short snitched
The nigga just mad' cuz he can't cop crisp
Y'all niggaz can't fuck wit the niggaz I fuck wit
Really don't wanna fuck wit niggaz I fuck wit
Y'all niggaz minor league in my eyes for real
Y'all niggaz wanna pop shit? See me when ya get a record deal
Y'all niggaz can't fuck wit the niggaz I fuck wit
You really don't wanna fuck wit niggaz I fuck wit
Y'all niggaz minor league in my eyes for real
Y'all niggaz wanna pop shit? See me when ya get a record deal
I observe the dread, winter time, big shot in my leg
Blood barrels, a big thick Benneton keg
Razor glass full, salute all Teflon, shoot wit the left arm
We sleepin' wit nukes, the blood is shed warm
High voltage guns, nuns wit jums in the gums
Razors, lazers, bulletproof blazers
Yo, remember what the team chanted
They bought the jewel from a don wit a king-sized hat on, slanted
Kangol wit Bentol, ya mental, mid war
Spill Hen' in the store, that's for the own'
Blaze wit a bent 4, yo these laws is yours
When we pour gasoline all in ya pours an' draws
So deceivin', flow speed change, lay him down, empty breathin'
Instead of these leaks, we leave the weak weapin'
'Operation Apparatus', spray shots through ya gray Stratus
Straight up status for maggots
Y'all niggaz can't fuck wit the niggaz I fuck wit
Ya really don't wanna fuck wit niggaz I fuck wit
Y'all niggaz minor league in my eyes for real
Y'all niggaz wanna pop shit? See me when ya get a record deal
Y'all niggaz can't fuck wit the niggaz I fuck wit
Ya really don't wanna fuck wit niggaz I fuck wit
Y'all niggaz minor league in my eyes for real
Y'all niggaz wanna pop shit? See me when ya get a record deal
Soldier boys stay on ya toes, be on ya P's an' Q's
Keep ya eyes bright comin' out ya buildin', Duke
You might bump into a bullet or stumble on ya death
Niggaz slumber, I put 'em in a deep coma
I keep guns 'cuz it's like that, you figure it out
I got an arson for niggaz tryin' to figure me out
You ain't a killa, you just talk more, runnin' ya mouth
Type of nigga, we'll stomp out an' bloody down
Look, we a Mobb for real, don't let the LPs twist it
Cut me a cheque 'cuz I don't talk business
Drop anthems worth millions an' spend millions
Take trips with my niggaz to the Keys on the weekends
Serious jewels, pissy off the fruits
Dunn, we move like the marines, move when we come through
Seduce bitches dizzy, half they friends an' they moms wanna hit me
Y'all know my stiggity
Y'all niggaz can't fuck wit the niggaz I fuck wit
Really don't wanna fuck wit niggaz I fuck wit
Y'all niggaz minor league in my eyes for real
Y'all niggaz wanna pop shit? See me when ya get a record deal
Y'all niggaz can't fuck wit the niggaz I fuck wit
Really don't wanna fuck wit niggaz I fuck wit
Y'all niggaz minor league in my eyes for real
