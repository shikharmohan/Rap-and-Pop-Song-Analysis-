Happy ass Weezy, never in a bad mood
3boy I talk sh-t like I swallowed a bathroom
girl give me vacuum, do it til her lips drool
the ice in your fridge never met a n-gga this cool
young money I'm richer than I used to be
I plant my seed in her garden now she root for me
baby I'mma tell you truthfully
I talk it and I do believe I walk it, call me orthopedic
Carter and I ought to be an author
damn, man and I tell ya, it'd be a best seller
Tim on the beat and me Miss-y-elli-OT goes wherever
ya dig,
ha, you can ask the bank teller
bot my money old like Nelson Mandela
ha, higher than a propellor
and baby I can show you better than acapella
