[Chrous: T.I]
Now I don't really care what you call me
Just as long as you dont call me rude
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
"Goodnight its over with" thats all she wrote
Streets like cold Chicago
Ain't nothing new I've seen it all before
But still I ball like no tomorrow
"Goodnight its over with" thats all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
I said "it's over with" thats all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote, all she wrote
"Goodnight its over with" thats all she wrote
[Verse 1: T.I.]
Its stupid how I go in knowing everybody knowing that i'm
Sewing up the game, destroying like they hate me for it
Eventually see they cant beat than with me they join
Others sworn, under oath or banished left completely scorn
You tell lies, get caught, nigga kick rocks
You never did blend in with the big shots
On the fast track, ain't no need for no pit stops
I just laugh at, nigga wishing they were this hot
Guess they mad at me huh, really pissed off (so)
Better that than pissed on, i'm the Jetsons you the Flintstones
Catch me in the end zone, high stepping prime time
Thought you niggas been on, ain't no blocking my shine
Like my new air Yeezy's you can see me in the night time
I get rich off livin' life, he check the check reciting rhymes
So call me what you want, wanna hate, have a nice time
While I get stupid paper, hey my dough ain't in its right mind (mind, mind)
[Chrous: T.I]
Now I don't really care what you call me
Just as long as you dont call me rude
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
"Goodnight its over with" thats all she wrote
Streets like cold Chicago
Ain't nothing new I've seen it all before
But still I ball like no tomorrow
"Goodnight its over with" thats all she wrote
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Man TIP told me on this hoe tip, best tip I could give you to hyp you
Is never to let these traits trick you
Mighty ambiguous of you to think I love slut, shit
Dig you hoe, take the shovel and dig you some dignity bitch
Shit you talk about some adivce that sticks with you
If I should listen to anyone tell me to stick to my guns
Like double stick, its you but fuck it TIP, its cold
I'm chillin like a villian like the penguin in his fucking igloo eating fudgesicles
I'd rather slip and fall in shit than fall in love with you
Before I tie a fucking knot I'd tie you in one bitch
You think this is some Nintendo game how fucking dumb is you
I'll give you some mumps before I split some lump sums with you
So here's a penny for your thoughts
But it won't buy you a chesseburger, but a nickle might just get you one pickle
Fuck it, its official so blow the whistle I got a trust issue
Theres a bombshell, scud missle!
I got this curse at you to fucking cuss at you
Like before I rap there was some motherfucking stud
Slut, this will teach you not to come drunk, stumbling my way fo shizzle
I still live like I bought you the Gilbert slot checks stob bizzle
So fuck sissors these checkers are bust like a blood blister
[Chorus: Eminem]
Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until its over and its all she wrote
[Verse 3: T.I.]
The credit roller, curatin closer, movie over with
But don't get mad at me
Go blame the chick who wrote this shit
Yeah life is sure a bitch
But she know I'm rich
That why she give me what I want and I just throw her dick
Here I go again
I kick this shit, give a damn, got it pouring in
Peso, euro, yeah, ah ha, I'm paid never gon be broke again
See me posted in anything, wearing any chain
Never gon' see me tote in anything
All you gon' see is BANG!
Its so nice where I kick it
Hate you never get to visit
Yeah I'm on another level
But you niggas still can get it
Its all over before you finish
Sorry bro this road we end it
Won't give you the satisfaction of me giving you the business
[Verse 4: Eminem]
Yeah I guess life is a bitch ain't it TIP
And each one thinks "Say this shit"
Shirt off my back I wouldn't give you the dirt off my handkerchief
I'm giving these hoes a dose of there own medicine
Let em get a good taste of it
I'm sure you got that relationship memo by now
But in case you didn't
This is so bad, put a sticky note to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wasting it
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker
That clock i'm racing in doubling time it
But I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time
It may take you pricks to catch on
While you strong arm like Stretch Armstrong
Man I still say K-mart like theres an apostrophe "S" on it dog
And they say McDonalds isn't a restaurant well I guess I'm wrong
But if you gon tell me that the A&W; aint the spot for the best hot dogs you can get the "F" on dawg
[Eminem]
Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
[T.I]
I bet the knew as soon as they saw me
"Goodnight its over with" thats all she wrote
[Eminem]
I roll like a desperado, now I never know where I'm gonna go
[T.I. & Eminem]
But still I ball like no tomorrow
"Goodnight its over with" thats all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
I said "it's over with" thats all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote, all she wrote
"Goodnight its over with" thats all she wrote
