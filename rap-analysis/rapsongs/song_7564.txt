Sup? you got a man
What the fuck is that?
You don't know who I am?
Oh yeah, well, he ain't got shit on me
Ya nigga ain't seeing me, I put that on everything
Put that on everything, put that on everything
Ya nigga ain't seeing me, I put that on everything
Put that on everything, put that on everything
Ya nigga ain't seeing me, I put that on everything
Put that on everything, put that on everything
Ya nigga ain't seeing me, I put that on everything
Put that on everything, put that on everything
I'm going out the same way I came in, hard than a motherfucker
Real street nigga, I ain't nothing like these other suckers
How much the club cost? I might buy this motherfucker
Have the feds park right outside this motherfucker
You know the name, bitch, hotter than fish grease
Got a hundred, moved a hundred that was this week
She want me to get the room man, this bitch cheap
But she roll the weed good and she a big freak
We on 75 her hands down my 87's
Dolce Gabbana belt, you know the Mack-11
First name Gots, last name Ends
Fix your mouth, fix your face, you might get a Benz
Ya nigga ain't seeing me, I put that on everything
Put that on everything, put that on everything
Ya nigga ain't seeing me, I put that on everything
Put that on everything, put that on everything
Ya nigga ain't seeing me, I put that on everything
Put that on everything, put that on everything
Ya nigga ain't seeing me, I put that on everything
Put that on everything, put that on everything
Put that on momma, my daddy and everything I love
For everything I rap, my gangstas in the trap
You can't see me with a magnifying glass
200 on the dash, try some games, I'll bust ya ass
Nigga whole click, iPhones, nigga, get your shine on
Used to whip it up and zip it up, now it's the microphone
No man alive to stop my shine, I'm a hustla mayne
I want it bad 'cause Bad Azz came from nothing man
Shining on 'em, grinding on 'em 'bout what I'm talking 'bout
If I show your bitch my house, she gon' take my dick and floss
Show after show I'm getting dough, 100 G's at a time
I'm MJ round my way and Louisiana is mine, nigga
Ya nigga ain't seeing me, I put that on everything
Put that on everything, put that on everything
Ya nigga ain't seeing me, I put that on everything
Put that on everything, put that on everything
Ya nigga ain't seeing me, I put that on everything
Put that on everything, put that on everything
Ya nigga ain't seeing me, I put that on everything
Put that on everything, put that on everything
Told you before, I'm a man 'bout his business
Draw the line, right where the family is
Never cross it, be the boss of it
Love ya down, until I've exhausted it
Other dudes, they pursue but they're clowns to you
I kneel down on the real and I pray with you
And never want too much, I make due for us
Believe me, I stand on my word
I put that on everything, believe me when I say
Put that on everything, everything
Put that on everything, everything
Put that on everything, everything
Put that on everything, everything
Put that on
Put it all on the line for your baby
Put it all on the line for your [Incomprehensible]
Put it all on the line for your baby
Put it all on the line for your [Incomprehensible]
Put it all on the line for your baby
Put it all on the line for your [Incomprehensible]
Put it all on the line, put it all on the line
Put it all on the line
Put that on everything, everything
Put that on
