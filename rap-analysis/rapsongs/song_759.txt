One to the, to the two
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
One time as we do it like this, yeah
Grand Puba, common sense
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's all love y'all, it's all love y'all
It's all love y'all, what you say?
Nigga
Maybe one day we can work it out
Strive to understand what life's about
All it seems to be is sadness and pain
Blood like rain clogs urban drains
When we gonna realize and make the change
And take the blame, erase the shame
'Cause new millennium is knockin' at your door
The new world order's what they got in store
Now I can't stress this enough, life sure is rough
You gotta go through a whole lotta shit just for you to get a little bit
Born into existence where your existence is non-existent
But your persistence overcomes their resistance
Your daily mechanism is your defense
Whether it be past or present tense, don't be dense
I'm droppin' this with common sense as we linger on into the darkness
Poisoned by society where high-anxiety is just one variety
Hatin' each other is another, brotha
I mean I'm really true to the shit, my spit ain't just spit
My duty is to save my people from all of this shit
And if I can get somethin' for doin' that then I'm gon' get and I won't quit
My ways and action manifest in my way of thinkin'
I just can't stand around and do nothin'
While my people sinkin', I told you that I stay true
And I gotta do, what I can do, when I can do
So maybe one day we can work it out
Strive to understand what life's about
All it seems to be is sadness and pain
Blood like rain clogs urban drains
When we gonna realize and make the change
And take the blame, erase the shame
'Cause new millennium is knockin' at your door
The new world order's what they got in store
Grand Pu, I'ma do, what I gotta do, when I can do
It's one for all like Brand Nubian, feedin' the multitudes
Of five loaves, dead men walkin' with lost souls
Some say the games are strange, our ways have been tribal
Since the days of Kemet, now displayed on Bennett
Revolution's like a pussy, I'm tryin' to stay up in it
And our music is a message, though some is afraid to send it
I don't know much about the new world order
II know I got a new daughter, direction and protection
I must provide for her, the moral of the story I'm building
Like O D B say, "We for the children"
Nike make a killin' off us, we kill each other, it kills me to see that
You take a life for gold, nigga did you really need that?
We try to escape the mix tapes, rims and weed sack
And to the new age, they say the women's gonna lead that, so
Maybe one day we can work it out
Strive to understand what life's about
All it seems to be is sadness and pain
Blood like rain clogs urban drains
When we gonna realize and make the change
And take the blame, erase the shame
'Cause new millennium is knockin' at your door
The new world order's what they got in store
Oh say it ain't so
It ain't so
My peoples at a all time low
Double oh Pu'
Nowadays we doin' anything for dough
For the dough doe
Don't you know that knowledge is the note
What?
Know the ledge, don't hit the edge
The negativity pulls us down like gravity
Yup
Devilish ways and actions poisons us like a cavity
Yes sir
As we send this one throughout our whole proximity
Grand Pu' and common strive to come together
In this era of prepaid calling cards, I roll with squads called the Gods
Ignorance is at large, struggles in our backyard
I slap box with life and see we wasn't that hard
Long as you got God, even got gramps off lah
It's stray lies and bullets directed, to lead the village
Of lies disconnected like ghetto phones
Fuck a search through a magazine for better homes
It ain't gonna happen till the devil's gone with the breeze
And niggas get off they knees so
Maybe one day we can work it out
Strive to understand what life's about
All it seems to be is sadness and pain
Blood like rain clogs urban drains
When we gonna realize and make the change
And take the blame, erase the shame
'Cause new millennium is knockin' at your door
The new world order's what they got in store
Black folk come on
Black people come on, come on, oh, oh yeah
Black people come on, I said
Black folk come on
Black people come on
Black people come on
Black people come on, I said
Black folk come on
