Yo, this is Yella, as we wine down to the final song
I wanted to make this one to remember my lil' nigga E
I know he wanted this track on his record
Though he was takin' from us to god damn soon
So I finished for him peace nigga
We did a song fuck da police you know
And everybody been hearing fuck sayin'
Fuck da police for years and years and years
And finally it took a muthaphukka to video tape
A nigga gettin' the shit beat out of him
For everybody else to say fuck da police
And we did fuck da police people put us down
And sayed we were ahead of our time you know it
Took the video you know ya shot by accident
To tell the truth and open the worlds eyes
Yes, we do have a serious problem in L.A.
And other citys true retaliate happens all the time
People tryin' to change things for years but I don't
Think anything is gonna help the problem is to deep
N.W.A. is just being brutally honest.
City of Compton, City of Crompton
City of, City of Compton, baby, baby
They swearin' on cable T.V. it ain't teachin'
Nobody nothin' new, 'cause little kids grow up
You know one, two years old hearin' there mother
Sayin' fuck this, you little son of bitch, I beat
The shit out of you and all this shit and you know
They pick up from all the shit and you know so they
Learn shit you know it's not gonna be teachin'
Muthaphukkaz nothin' new
'Cause I got some new words for your ass
We don't tell you to go out and gang bang
We tell you ya know and our songs is as you
Know if you could go out stealin' and killin'
And beatin' up people all day but that person
Ends up dead or in jail sometimes he gets away
You know and we don't have no rags no red no blue
Rags and tellin' we gonna go out and creep or go
Out and do that other thing or whateva it is
You know we ain't tell you to be joinin' no gang
Or whateva else
Rollin' down, rollin' down, rollin' down
