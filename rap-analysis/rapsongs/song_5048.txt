Gather 'round, go ahead and stair
These street folks don't need permission, my life's in hi-definition
Listen with your eyes, follow with your ears
I don't need no intermission, my life's in hi-definition
And my return is more like a re-up
I hold a whole like a tea cup
World in one hand, while the other hand throw the peace up
My other hand throwin' we without the E up
I got like 5 more man, I'm somethin' like Shiva
In that Fall of Rome number 4 deluxe
See I bin around the world like the nomb
But I come from a zone where the homes' all beat up
The folks unknown and the stones' all meet up
Police tap my phones, got my songs on speaker
Say he's back to poems, got their domes all geeked up
To get up on they throwns and become young leaders
Opera put it on my culture, now if that ain't wrong
Imus got it from the rhymers, now if that ain't blown
They gave my man 44, now if that ain't long
I put it all on my shoulders, now if that ain't strong
I made it out alive from the streets of the West side C-H-I
Now of that ain't home, you betta tell 'em
Gather 'round, go ahead and stair
These street folks don't need permission, my life's in hi-definition
Listen with your eyes, follow with your ears
I don't need no intermission, my life's in hi-definition
And in my flyness, I've become the hero and the sidekick
The rider and the nigga that I ride with
In ya ear, like the maker of 'The Vivrant'
A salaam alaikum to the maker of 'The Vivrant'
Them other niggas I don't vibe with
Now I was 'bout three when the eyes went
But I can see everythin' that you tryin' be
You can't hide it
While you comin' out your throat like a hymlic
I came up out the belly like a high scrip
Only my circumstance revised it
Hijacked the role and went and shot the pilot
I'm tryin' go public so I can get to private
Then send Bizzy to go and get the pirates
Then hit Africa try to fix the virus
Go back to the hood, tell Huggie open the hydrants
R I P stack B, I'ma keep you alive kid
Dressed in somethin' so fresh and wonderful
F N F and S N double O P
Gather 'round, go ahead and stair
These street folks don't need permission, my life's in hi-definition
Listen with your eyes, follow with your ears
I don't need no intermission, my life's in hi-definition
Lupy, it's Snoopy, let's go out
Tip toe through the door do it doggy style
And tell all my chicks, in she I cock owe
Lupy hit the Lotto, Snoopy hit bottle
Dolomite tight they bite it might follow
Take this chill pill will niggas swallow
Recital is very homicidal
The big screen will capture you, 'cause it's hi-definition
Listen cookin' collard greens in the kitchen
Them alphabet boys on a mission
If you out to get cash you better get it quick fast
Now a days niggas get to snitchin' on your bitch ass
You and ya boys best believe in them toys out your game
Specially when a nigga know your real name
Blam blam with the blammer
Smile nephew your on candid camera, film at eleven
Dressed in somethin' so fresh and wonderful
F N F and S N double O P
Gather 'round, go ahead and stair
These street folks don't need permission, my life's in hi-definition
Listen with your eyes, follow with your ears
I don't need no intermission, my life's in hi-definition
