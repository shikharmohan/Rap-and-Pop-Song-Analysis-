Back up, back up, back up, back up
Back up, back up, back up, back up
Ease off, this goes out to all area crew
(Yes, yes)
To my BK crew
(Ooh, ooh, wee)
To my QB crew, my LI crew
My Shaolin crew
My Dirty South crew
(What cha'll niggaz about the Dirty South?)
Atlanta, North Cakalak'
For all my fam, all area crew
(Aow)
Yeah, mon
Yes, the first cut should be the deepest
To penetrate beyond the muscle wall's inner regions
First you was icin' me, connect with the starin' at the speakers
Heard the rhyme, head high, what ya starin' at ya sneakers
You shy now, got a lot of things on your mind now
You don't feel fly now, you huntin' the exit sign down
Fuck what you heard, 'cause I snatch the grapevine down
(Yeah, yeah)
Don't understand how I ran the line down, rewind now
Yo, we be the most magnetic, so athletic
Leave your peeps on the side so they can
Watch you and your mans get it
Take the arch rivalry stance up on the podium
And give the flavor to niggaz, but keep it low on sodium
Posess shit that got you wonderin' how we holdin' 'em
Things that'll lay you out like a piece of linoleum
Bring whoever you want
We bout to bug son and bounce
Down to Henry Hudson
After I bust one
Yo, Mos Def

Hay dios mio, me and Bustarimo es peligro
The hottest negroes en Los Estados Unidos
Hotter than Reno when discovered by Bugsy Siegal
I'm black like Don Cheadle, shoutin' power to the people
My rhymes dipping like the lifeline on the e-boat
The raw sugar cane, NutraSweet, never Equal
If you in a Benzito or your mother's Buick Regal
I get up like Chino shoutin' power to the people
Yo, me and the Mighty Mos shine like a light post
Live nigga shit be straight fuckin' up the white folks
That's why they with it now, because niggaz like me and you
We did it now, brought it to that level so they get it now
We graduated, saturated the game now
Infatuated with the fame, now let me explain how
We doin' this, at any time or any place ready willin' and able
Let's get the dough secure the food on the table
Ay, Mos Def

Ain't no time to hesitate at the gate

From east, west, north and south, I got joints for all of those
Heavy aquatic water flows, keep them on they toes
Tell them thugs that wanna be CEO's to be derobed
'Fore I wear your little dumb ass out like Easter clothes
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
It's like a freak show, soon as my heat blow
Sometime I speak slow so people understand my street flow
And while we keep it hot, we got the most shine up in
This whole shit, me and Mos spit and blow the show quick
Watch owt, your pussy sound get bucked Souf
Mos 'n Bussa Rhymes too bad man-a-shutout
Watch owt, give a damn whut fancy car ya hop owt
Shut down your game like da NBA lockout
Ya betta watch owt, I'm 'bout to black on niggaz
Like I'm blowin' on a sax, blowin' my gats on niggaz
Blowin' my raps on niggaz, now let me mash out
We fatter than the biggest ass chicks pokin', they ass out
Hey, Mos Def
