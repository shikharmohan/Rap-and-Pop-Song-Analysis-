I got a question fo' you hatin' ass niggaz out there, ay
Why you mad at me, ay
Oh, lame ass nigga, why you mad at me
Sucka ass nigga, why you mad at me
Remember late nights, earn stripes, servin' straight white
Talk shit, slap box clear into the day light
Might fuss, may fight but stay tight
Keep what the 'J' need for the lighter hit the base pipe
If the trap was the ocean or the sea
You could consider me and them the killa whales and great whites
Befo' a nigga tried to click it make them think twice
'Cause they knew Cap would kill a nigga fo' blink twice
Day right, I'm recitin' my life
Nigga I was there no matter what through sirens on a silent night
Cold Sundays, slow Mondays, hot Friday nights
Tuesday Thursdays servin' whether or not they ride tonight
On peaceful days hostful evenings even violent nights
Chip on my shoulder hold a grudge 'cause you can die tonight
I swear you niggaz had no idea what my life was like
Befo' the bright lights and a half a mil just to grab the mic
Is it 'cause I came from the bottom to the top
(Why you mad at me)
Maybe 'cause I spent a hundred on a drop
(Why you mad at me)
Is it 'cause I kept it pimpin' and stayed down
(Why you mad at me)
Or is it 'cause I am the a town
(That's why you mad at me)
Is 'cause you a lame and I'm a 'G'
(Why you mad at me)
Is it 'cause I got love in the streets
(Why you mad at me)
Is 'cause you know yo' time runnin' out
(That's why you mad at me)
Is it 'cause you know I'm king of the south
(That's why you mad at me)
Niggaz mad 'cause I got it like this
Gold on my wrist hoes on my dick, my dick
But I could give a fuck about this industry
I'm a be the same tip 'til the end of me
That's something you know automatically if you a friend of me
Question that will think other wise now you offend me
I came in this game not looking for a friend or enemy
Found them both now that niggaz in to me
Got little rap niggaz liking into me
Major labels and polices want to censor me
Feds on my ass 'cause I'm in the streets
Think I still slang listen to lame niggaz who lie to snitch on me
It ain't my fault that you can't picture me
Ridin' in a phantom and I swear I never fathom
All the fame that a nigga can gain from Atlanta
Now I'm just tryin' to maintain for Atlanta
Befo' niggaz would say in Atlanta
I was Rhode Park Doug high stayed in Atlanta
Now true enough I sold yay in Atlanta
But is that compared to contributions, I made to Atlanta
Is it 'cause I came from the bottom to the top
(Why you mad at me)
Maybe 'cause I spent a hundred on a drop
(Why you mad at me)
Is it 'cause I kept it pimpin' and stayed down
(Why you mad at me)
Or is it 'cause I am the a town
(That's why you mad at me)
Is 'cause you a lame and I'm a 'G'
(Why you mad at me)
Is it 'cause I got love in the streets
(Why you mad at me)
Is 'cause you know yo' time runnin' out
(That's why you mad at me)
Is it 'cause you know I'm king of the south
(That's why you mad at me)
A pick a reason any reason all excuses would do
But man you lucky, I ain't buckin' like I used to do fool
While you was throwin' one's and two's, I was liftin' up tools and then
Shoot at his shoes just to see if he move
Or either bust at his head to check if he dead man
Don't talk around 'cause I heard he the Fed's man
They offer him time and they knowin' he scared and tell him
Give me they names or you doin' the stretch man
Or wear a wire go record what he said
And then you can tell his lawyer that his clients a dead man
A rat I'm smellin', blow I ain't sellin'
Where you got that impressin' ain't no tellin'
Yes, I'm a felon why was that in question
What about all these records I'm sellin'
I'm bank head born and bank head bread
And when a nigga die, I'm gone be bank head dead
Is it 'cause I came from the bottom to the top
(Why you mad at me)
Maybe 'cause I spent a hundred on a drop
(Why you mad at me)
Is it 'cause I kept it pimpin' and stayed down
(Why you mad at me)
Or is it 'cause I am the a town
(That's why you mad at me)
Is 'cause you a lame and I'm a 'G'
(Why you mad at me)
Is it 'cause I got love in the streets
(Why you mad at me)
Is 'cause you know yo' time runnin' out
(That's why you mad at me)
Is it 'cause you know I'm king of the south
(That's why you mad at me)
