The instamatic focal point bringing damage to your boroughs
Be some brothers from the east with some beats that be thorough
Got the solar gravitation so I'm bound to pull it
I gets down like brothers are found ducking from bullets
Gun control means using both hands in my land
Where it's all about the cautious livin'? Migrating to a higher form
Of consequence, compliments of strugglin', that shouldn't be notable
Man, every word I say should be a hip hop quotable
I'm sick of bitch's shakin' asses, I'm sick of talkin' about blunts
Sick of Versace glasses, sick of slang, sick of half-ass awards shows
Sick of name brand clothes, sick of R&B; bitches over bullshit tracks
Cocaine and crack which brings sickness to blacks
Sick of swoll' head rappers with their sicker than raps
Clappers and gats, makin' the whole sick world collapse
The facts are gettin' sick even sicker perhaps
Stickabush to make a bundle to escape this synapse
Man life can get all up in your ass baby you betta work it out
Let me tell you what it's all about a skin not considered equal
A meteor has more right than my people, who be wastin' time? Screaming who they've hated, that's why the native tongues
Have officially been reinstated
Vibes, vibrations, stakes is high, higher than high
You know them stakes is high, higher than high
When we talkin' 'bout the vibes, vibrations
Stakes is high, you know them stakes is high
When we dealin' with the vibes, vibrations
Stakes is high, hey yo, what about that love?
Yo, it's about love for cars, love for funds, loving to love mad sex
Loving to love guns, love for opposite, love for fame and wealth
Love for the fact of no longer loving yourself, kid, we living in them
Days of the man made ways where every aspect is vivid
These brothers no longer talk shit, hey yo, these niggas live it
'Bout to give it to you 24/7 on the microphone plug one translating
The zone, no offense to a player, but yo, I don't play
And if you take offense, fuck it, got to be that way
JD Dove, show your love, what you got to say?
I say G's are making figures at a high regard
And niggas dying for it Nowadays ain't odd, investing in fantasies
And not God, welcome to reality, see times is hard
People try to snatch the credit, but can't claim the card
Showing out in videos, saying they cold stars
See, shit like that will make your mama cry
Better watch the way you spend it, 'cause the stakes is high
Y'all know them stakes is high
When we talkin' 'bout the vibes, vibrations
Stakes is high
I think that smiling in public is against the law
'Cause love don't get you through life no more
It's who you know and how you, son and how you gettin' in
And who the man holding, hey yo, and how was the scams
And how high? Yo what up? I heard you caught a body
Seem like every man and woman shared a life with John Gotti
But they ain't organized, mixing crimes with life enzymes
Taking the big scout route and niggas know doubt better
Than they know their daughters and their sons, oh boy
Yo, people go through pain and still don't gain positive contact
Just like my main man, who got others cleaning up
His physical influence, his mind got congested
He got the nine and blew it, neighborhoods are now hoods
'Cause nobody's neighbors, just animals surviving
With that animal behavior, under I, who be rhyming
From dark to light sky, experiments when needles and skin connect
No wonder where we live is called the projects
When them stakes is high you damn sure try to do anything to get
The piece of the pie electrify, even die for the cash but at last I be out Even though you wantin' more, this issue is closed like an elevator door But soon reopened once we get to the next floor where the
Vibes, vibrations, stakes is high, y'all know them stakes is high
When we talkin' 'bout the vibes, vibrations
Stakes is high, stakes is high, come on
