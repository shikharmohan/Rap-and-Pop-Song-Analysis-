{bridge}

i think you oughta listen to me 
{chorus}
i'd slow down (all the way down, down, down) 
before you hurt yourself 
i'd slow down (all the way down, down, down) 
it's just not worth it 
i'm savin tens (i'm savin tens) 
for a rainy day (for a rainy day) 
just slow down (slow it all the way down) 
i'd slow down (just slow it all the way down) 
{verse 2}
you're so innocent 
they're gona try to run a game (a game) 
on you (on you) 
just be aware of all the lies 
that they use (they use) 
I can't help it 
cos i've been 
in your shoes (your shoes) 
i'm givin you the rules (the rules) 
{bridge}
you need to stop and listen 
cos every word i say is true 
try to pay attention 
i'm just tryna watch out for you 
i know you're on a mission 
i see how you're living 
but chu don't wana end'up missin 
i think you oughta listen to me 
{chorus}
i'd slow down 
slow down (all the way down, down, down) 
before you hurt yourself 
i'd slow down (all the way down, down, down) 
it's just not worth it 
i'm savin tens (i'm savin tens) 
for a rainy day (for a rainy day)

i'd slow down (just slow it all the way down) 
[LUPE]
you movin too fast 
you movin too quick 
you heavy on the gas 
you movin too swift 
can't keep up the pace 
might not finish the race 
but do it now for it's too late to switch 
and how you make a impala lift 
but the set card is ya heart 
and is hard to be fixed 
you gon break it if you don't downshift 
and i know you get a rush when you hang around risk 
but you gon get enough when you breakin down sick 
all ill cant move your wheels and feelin like shhh 
just a mile back you was feelin quite brisk 
now you sittin on bricks, wit ya car on strict 
radio gone 
insurance won't cover 
paint job wreck 
and you draggin your muffler 
would'nt listen then, but i bet you hear now 
cos you gotta speed ticket 
cos you would'nt slow down, yeeeah 
[EVA]
{chorus}
i'd slow down (all the way down, down, down) 
before you hurt yourself 
i'd slow down (all the way down, down, down) 
it's just not worth it 
i'm savin tens (i'm savin tens) 
for a rainy day (for a rainy day) 
just slow down (slow it all the way down) 
i'd slow down (just slow it all the way down)
