Together we witness one of the most delightful in our times
So um, let the bass go
Nah, it's got to go a little lower than that, Dre, drop it
Nah, it's gotta go even lower than that, you know why?
(Why?)
You've been denied, although you've tried
So I've been a ving to make you fall like a tide
No disappointment 'cause my beat will sooth like an ointment
Suckers with static approach and get smoked like a joint
Phlegm ignites the flame, I mean, I burn like a lighter
Roll with the hip-hop groove 'cause I'm a writer
The hero of great, take a stand and we'll see
Eat in chronological order startin' with me
A rap introduction, the suckers destruction
Yeah, are all involved when I started conductin'
The lyrics are the maximum, I stated for facts in them
Chumps never try to break knowin', I'd wax them
Murder in the first degree
Occurs only when dealin' with the D O to the C
I'm like a whirlwind pyramid and I'm lettin' you know
I get ill when I hear the bass go
Yeah, that's the sound and you know it's down
But you know why?
(Why's that?)
'Cause I've been around and you've heard the sound
Of the D.O.C. and the new style that I've found
It's quite unorthodox but still bass and
Enough to make you dance, so I picked up the pace and
Let it ride like a cyclist
And see it show in the end that I'm the mightiest
And that I'm lyrically inclined to make you want to step to my time
The beat and the cut to this rhyme
Do a show and I'm good to like a G O
Never gettin' skeezed, I mean it's like an N O
Happiness to me is like a positive cash flow
So I let your ear cold hear when the bass go
Kick it over here, kick it over here
Now I think, it's about time you
Feel the beat
Drop that bass
(Aight, bet)
I don't wanna 'cause if I do you might lose it
  (Stop)
I made this record for you to jam, so use it
Kill the treble, pump the bass and then
Send the suckers on the block into a tailspin
Roll by, boomin' like a nuke bomb
I know there's pressure on your ears but stay calm
After you pass, though, you better turn it down some
Or else, you're gonna put a dent into your eardrum
Success realize on the individual
I feel successful when receiving the residual
But as for you, you all should know
When I say "Let's get hype", I'm lettin' the bass go
Now that's the way it should be done
I know that's on the one and that is fun
To see a sucker standin' weary
And girlies on the tip standin' near me
The bass was the topic so I dropped it
Added some dope lyrics and then I locked it
On track 24 in a machine
To make you move on the hip-hop scene
Cued up Dre and I knew that he would know
That on the one, I would let the bass go
Because a dope jam is what I gotta make
I make it rattle 'cause you love it when it vibrates
The D, the O and to the C
Must cause pleasure when showin' yo my abilities
To inject on the set mass enjoyment
This is to insure definite employment
When I hit town, yo you'll know
Crowds will roar and you'll hear the bass go
Yeah, let the bass go
This is most definitely down with my homeboy
DJ Speed, is that on track?
Word 'em up, peace
