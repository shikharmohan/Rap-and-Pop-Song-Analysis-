It's that shit, you know what I'm sayin'?
I'm a give a shout out to my niggas
I ain't givin' a shout out to no park, nobody, fuck that
Big baby, Jesus in the mother fucking house
Know what I'm sayin'? Uh, uh, oh, oh, come on, uh, uh
I don't walk, I stalk, livin' foul like pork
Shuttin' down underground streets of New York
Hawk is what them niggas call me 'cause they all be
Suckin' my dick and on my mother fucking balls, G
I know the half, so, I laugh wit 'em
Blood bath, whet I let the fuckin' rap hit 'em
Full clip but only half did 'em
That's all it took, another crook taken out over a dirty look
I bag game with niggas, I leave shot dead
You're only taken a piss from me with hot led
You know my style nigga 'cause I'm always schemin'
In jail, niggas holdin' a sink screamin', "Police"
But you got no peace
Yo, was that you big man and a lot mo' grease
All I gets is pounds, you ain't want none of this
Back streets are like track meets 'cause I be runnin' this
Ain't nowhere to run
  ('Cause I be runnin' this)
Ain't nowhere to hide
  (Come on)
Ain't nowhere to go
  ('Cause I be runnin' this)
Reap the seeds you sow
  (Come on)
Surrounded by the colors, I see crimson, black and blue
  (Come on)
Locking open doors again, I'm still afraid of you
  (Straight up, mother fucker)
Light to dark, then light again, I always thought I knew
  (Come on)
Young to old and young again, what's left for me to do?
  (Straight up)
Sister of the universe, collecting me in time
  (Come on)
I'm falling down upon the earth and singing truth in rhyme
  (Come on)
If I was a rolling stone I'd roll until I'm through
  (Come on)
And if I was a garden I would bloom in black for you
  (Dirt dog in effect)
Ain't nowhere to run
  ('Cause I be runnin' this)
Ain't nowhere to hide
  (Come on)
Ain't nowhere to go
  ('Cause I be runnin' this)
Reap the seeds you sow
  (Come on)
Ain't nowhere to run
  ('Cause I be runnin' this)
Ain't nowhere to hide
  (Come on)
Ain't nowhere to go
  ('Cause I be runnin' this)
Reap the seeds you sow
  (Come on)
What you mother fuckers invented
Is the craziest nigga that ever been invented
Most know, don't front on ol' dity bastard
I call on Jesus, Jesus
There's no obstacles that you have to jump
There's no walls that you have to climb
This is real, this is elementary, dear
Elementary, Watson, elementary, aah
I ain't no picture on your fore wall
Necklace wearin' beard
You don't want this money till it's rich
Buy my album, coded by dirty, set you free
Go against the grain, I got the P
I know you don't recognize me now
I [Incomprehensible]
How many lightening bulbs do it take to light up a fuck mode?
Brother and people
You'd better get the fuck off of me
We don't need it, it gets more ugly
Fools tryin' to bust their ass
Tryin' to get away from me when I said my real name
I call myself in the niggas butt hole
All the same, all the same, all the same, yeah
Ain't nowhere to run
Ain't nowhere to hide
Ain't nowhere to go
Reap the seeds you sow
