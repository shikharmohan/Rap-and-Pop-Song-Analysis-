Let's do it again
Let's do it again
Sweet breeze in the summer time
We're makin' everything alright
Always keep ya hypnotized
We keep ya feelin' oh so high
Like it's 1999
All over again with all of my hustlas and soldiers by my side
Been a long, long ride, I'm still amazed how the time fly by
A lot of my niggas didn't make it to see this but I'm not gonna cry
We slammin' doors on the caddy coupe after bar groupin'
When them niggas was out there shootin' drinkin' 40's on the roof
Went from zeros to six figures to seven figures and better
Niggas determined to get on the level down for whatever
Chasin' that chedda
Ride anywhere necessary, the celebration is necessary
It's a hard load to carry but that deal was temporary
I let it relax sometimes just chill out with my money
Then when Layzie Bone is at it again, another summer
Let's have a ball nigga and keep this one blazin'
Sweet breeze in the summer time
We're makin' everything alright
Always keep ya hypnotized
We keep ya feelin' oh so high
Sweet breeze in the summer time
We're makin' everything alright
Always keep ya hypnotized
We keep ya feelin' oh so high
Hey, they thought it was over the Bone Thugs-N-Harmony was finished
But they, they must of forgot, they forgot how much I rapper like I
Sat back recline, and trained my mastermind
Came up with a faster rhyme in time this dogg has got u hypnotized
So I gotta ask them how in the hell we gon' fall off
When we got half of this industry swangin' from my balls
Me and dawgs untouchable niggas, could never see us, never be us
Won't even get close enough to try to defeat us
Niggas that have they come learn with the milla-meta, meta
Loudest niggas you ever gonna see, talk and get served
And you'll that we be it, runnin' the game still doin' our everyday thangs
Bang, so I really hope u got you game up 'cause we comin' hard
So don't get involved if y'all ain't ready to bring ya gangsta
Sweet breeze in the summer time
We're makin' everything alright
Always keep ya hypnotized
We keep ya feelin' oh so high
Sweet breeze in the summer time
We're makin' everything alright
Always keep ya hypnotized
We keep ya feelin' oh so high
You feelin' we slippin', huh
You think that we missin' the 1st of the month
10 years we done been here
We spending them thangs and bringin' them guns, yup
We better get it, we don't have that ammunition
But I bet we takin' it there
Got us a mac if u wanna ride
I ain't braggin' but I keep it real
You know them thug niggas is gonna bring something
That everybody gonna feel
You ridin' and rollin' and smokin' and bumpin'
Yeah, that's how I live
And I been here so I live here
Won't put me out my crib
My address is the game
And my second it is the hood
We comin' back like cool water and soda
A couple of shakes
And we hittin' the hood with that heart
Do it again we gotta [Incomprehensible]
Part of the thugsta law back to nothing
Nothing bumpin' goin' to jump
I did it then and that is where I'm from
And I can do it again and again and again and again
Sweet breeze in the summer time
We're makin' everything alright
Always keep ya hypnotized
We keep ya feelin' oh so high
Sweet breeze in the summer time
We're makin' everything alright
Always keep ya hypnotized
We keep ya feelin' oh so high
Sweet breeze
Sweet breeze
Sweet breeze
