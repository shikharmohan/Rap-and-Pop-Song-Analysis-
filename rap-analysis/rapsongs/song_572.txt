Krayzie -  
 
Jeremiah 10: 23-24 
We will know, o lord, that to earthly man his way does not belong, 
It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step 
Correct me oh Jehovah, 
However with judgment, not in anger, that you may not reduce us to nothing. 
 
Chorus -  
 
Order my steps 
 
Lead me guide me everyday 
 
Send your anointing 
Father i pray 
Order my steps in your word (word) 
 
Verse 1 - 
 
Layzie -  
 
Why ima pay this price for fame 
What a shame 
Im to blame 
Cuz my soul all-empty 
When i can stop and give it all to Christ 
Cuz in his name no weapon shall be formed against me 
Simply, know that the world gon tempt me 
Satan is the enemy 
God please help us 
I don't wanna be selfish 
I don't wanna live my life tryna be rebellious 
 
Wish -  
 
Who be checkin when you know we doin wrong huh? 
Got your steps 
Keep your pressures 
Know right from wrong 
Turn the lights on 
All we gotta do is follow faith 'til he call us all home 
But it's so hard 
Temptation is everywhere 
Gotta hold my guard like oh my god (hallelujah) 
Oh my god (hallelujah) 
 
Krayzie -  
 
Now ima not make it to heaven 
But im tryna come back in the resurrection 
Take my place in paradise 
So i pray to god 
Tryna change my life 
But temptation makes it hard for me to make it out 
Man i gotta quit lustin 
I need to stop smokin 
I need God's guidance 
Without it im hopeless 
Lone and about 
World zonin me out 
I'm gone 
Lord please help me stand strong 
 
Chorus 
 
Verse 2 - 
 
Layzie -  
 
Alotta soldiers in the pen  
Aint neva comin home 
Can you find it in your heart to pray? 
So it seems everythang goin wrong 
When you're just tryna find your way 
Mamma just wanna feed her babies 
Tryna keep a safe place to stay 
Don't stress 
It's a test 
God bless 
All you really gotta do is just keep your faith 
 
Wish -  
 
You can send it if you open up 
You can get it if you need love 
As much as a mustard seed is all it need 
It's a small price to pay for the air we breathe 
And the babies born 
Place to go when we leave 
Food that we eat 
When will we sleep 
It's a miracle 
No believe in the lord 
 
Krayzie -  
 
Ay 
What you seein on the news has been already written in the bible 
But aint nobody takin the time 
To realize  
That relivin and readin the scriptures could mean your survival 
And i don't wanna die 
No neva 
I wanna live forever in a world a lot betta 
So when Armageddon really come true 
What you gon do 
 
Chorus x2 
 
Verse 3 -  
 
Layzie - 
(Krayzie in the background - 'swing low') 
 
 
God loves me  
Ask me how i know 
God loves me 
Ask me how i know 
God loves me 
Ask me how i know 
I know 
Cuz the bible tells me so 
 
You know god is good 
You know god is great 
And everyday i wake up gotta thank him for my life 
And even though it's hard i know i make mistakes 
I give it everything it take 
Just to make it right 
This is Satans land 
Understand the plan 
Y'all Jesus coming back with a furious mob 
Betta praise everyday 
Hurry get on your job 
Glory to the king 
That's my heavenly father 
 
Chorus
