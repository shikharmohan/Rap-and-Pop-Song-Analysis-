Oh man, bitches, man, bitches, sick and tired of this shit
You know what I'm sayin'? Want my money
Talkin' shit, don't know how to act, phuckin' tired, man
Phuck'm I gonna do, man? Have to put a foot up your ass?
Phuckin' tired of it, man, phuckin' buy you this, buy you that
Phuck that shit, Kurious ain't havin' it, know what I'm sayin'?
Boo boo head, boo boo head, boo boo head
I want you dead, I want you bled and bleeding
Needing medical assistance, resistance
Ya kiss meant nuthin', you was bluffin'
Stuffin' my brain with insane thoughts and notions
Most intelligent people freak you because they'll know
You'll give, ya all give up your drawls
Flap ya jaws and lyin' and have me cryin'
I'll admit it, someone before musta shitted down your neck
Boo boo head but can you be dead?
With fled instead of the murda
I'll just tell everybody what I heard of, word up
All a this over boo boo heads
All a this, all a this
Back in elementary school, you made me drool, I was cool
A rules were never broken, a token of our friendship
All my friends flippin' somersaults
The fault was not yours of course, they didn't know
Yo, grils was yucky, clear 'round and get slapped like a pucky
But you never said 'Phuck me', that wasn't in the pictua
I couldn't hit ya with ya hair and braids
And the games we played were fun
Till one day a friend said, "Boo boo heads turn red
In the face when you place ya hands on her ass
In class, and give a spank a banka full of fun at recess and be fresh"
Okay, I'll try it and die if she does but she did
And turned around and socked me like Rocky
I feel like a heel for real but now I'm older
And told ya to keel over 'cause now it's different
No innocence and women sprints the way
You sway to the forces of evil
And we will bust that ass fast and quickly
I dig G's, disrespectin' rep
Now it's when they shit's come bobbin' brothers
Try and rob another, and I'll rub ya the wrong way, let the song play
All a this over boo boo heads
All a this, all a this
Ooh, I wanna smack you
Mack you and attack you
Even if you black, you get no slack
Sue, call a lawyer, boy, ya never knew
Ya crew is on a mission every weekend
Freakin' and kissin' with other van ya man
Let's turn the sands in the hourglass
And your power lasts less and guess
And take a gander I slander ya name
And spread propaganda
And I demand ya ta stop
Hop on a train before pain'll be ya middle name
In the game of love and happiness
Yes, I caressed ya flesh but if you test
Ya caught out there without a vest
Mess around and you can rest
I found a new boo boo
Baby, maybe I can crave the one
That saves thee reputation, ya'll let's face it
Ya basin', smokin', leavin' niggas broken and open
But I scope in to ya brain gain and remain
And clues ya use for protection now who's next in
All a this over boo boo heads
All a this, all a this
