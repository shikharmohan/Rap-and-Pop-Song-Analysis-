Urr, uh huh
Y'all motherfuckers ready or what?
Is y'all motherfuckers ready or what?
I don't think you are, I don't think so
They got my back against the buildin'
I'm the villain that's creepin'  around corners
Like Shorty you see them niggas creepin' around, warn us
We might be comin' through, gunnin' through, runnin'  through
So be careful what you do or the slugs might come to you
As long as I can remember, the streets have kept me safe
And ever since that time in December, the heat's been in my waist
I need an extra set of eyes so I keep my dogs with me
Doctor says let them die said his fuckin'  dog bit me
I don't know what's wrong with me
But it seems like since you heard of us
Y'all niggas turnin'  into murderers
Couldn't fuck with a third of us
Still against me and wantin' to see me in the box
Grillin'  me all crazy when you see me and the L.O.X.
Leave you Red like Foxx, ain't nothin' funny about that
I see you in a coma, ain't comin' up out that
You hold on for too long
And they ain't pullin' the plug for you
I'll run up in the joint myself and bust another slug on you
It's murda, it's murda motherfuckers
I take a squat then post up with the toast up
I brin' beef to a closure, know somethin'?
From cats stackin' four-somes
I'm loathsome
I scream out fuck the world then I throw somethin'
Niggas schemin'  hard but fuck it, it's the God
I leave bullets lodged leave you leanin'  on your broad
And our punks leave you gagged up in your car
Slumpin'  Kennedy-style with your memory out
What the fuck y'all want? Daddio with the calico
Let the gaty blow leave you bleedin'  on your patio
I leave rivals on their backs lookin'  up at the sky blue
Not only do I leave you I hide you, I before you
X and Ja-Rule, death before dishonor now and prior to
Boss man spy on you, conspire you
Me die before you? You liar, you
Niggas is dead off the hits I approve
Fuck it, I got the feds wearin' wired suits
Y'all niggas don't listen
Whether in streets or in prison
When we find them we twist them
They fuckin'  up missin'
Y'all don't understand we want y'all all to hate it
It's murda, murder incorporated
It's murda, in crime we all related
It's murda, see if y'all can take it
I'ma murderer and murderin' anythin' that moves
Through ya nine niggas, straight do or die niggas
Caught up and fall victim to the worst shit
X, Jigga, and Ja as expected
Shot on the world and reflect it
Niggas don't respect it, so get it the worst way
Fuck with the wolves you get hunted like prey
Shot up in broad day, now everybody want you
I'm feelin' like stupid didn't the inc. warn you the first time
It's murda, whenever you see blood
It's murda, lay you down for the love
That's us, leave the lights on
Knife through your windpipe
'Cause most of your niggas ain't cut right
You thinkin' it's alright, but it ain't
I'm paralyzin' clowns up and down from the waist
Givin'  niggas face lifts and takin'  it
While makin' you bleed
And if I got a taste of the shit I'm takin' more than you need
It's nothin' but love between me, you, and these slugs
Hit him up wrap his body up in a area rug
Who holdin' the heat?
Who leavin' niggas cold in the street?
Y'all know me, ya Co-D, Ja-Rule the O.G.
Niggas better watch me closely
Get a grip, it's Hennessy that fuels all that murderin' shit
When I look in the mirror my reflection is killer
Jigga, X, Ja niggas, it's murda
