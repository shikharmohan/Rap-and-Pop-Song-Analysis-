Let's talk about who I am
Blond bee, find me in the hood with my peoples
Love y'all, hate the rest of y'all that I can see through
Above that, I can't feel nothin' unless it's lethal
Testin' your moves, never that, make no position fetal
I wanna talk about Dog nigga, L O X, Eve, and me
Now that's the hottest thing in the streets are beats is Swizz
Cheesed up with holes in the shit like a log rolled thick
And ain't nothin' sweet but Drag-Eve tracks, Honey Roasted
Burn until its been around the hour, fuck that
Yo let's talk about
Platinum plaques, hangin' on my wall
See me decorated, she's the one
Heard 'em say it, see me celebrate it
I pop shit when it's necessary, not for nothin'
I use clips for them big beefs, see me bustin', plow
I wanna talk about bitches I fucked
I'm a dog so I can't stand no bitch that hounds, I far from a clown
If I'm not knocking her down, Drag's probably not around
So I'm not one to claim by either one of you dames
If y'all catch Drag with a mane, trust me
She got my last name, here's the hook, uh
Now Drag gon' show y'all niggas how we lock this shit
Now Eve gonna show y'all niggas how we drop these hits
Now we gonna show y'all niggas how we pop this Cris
Drag E, dash V, on E
Now Drag gon' show y'all niggas how we lock this shit
Now Eve gonna show y'all niggas how we drop these hits
Now we gonna show y'all niggas how we pop this Cris
Drag E, dash V, on E
Let's talk about little dick niggas
Always talkin' bout what you got, rather be finger-popped
Dick probably the size of a bough stuffed with rocks
Fuck the cop nigga, go shoot pool, pussy plot
You make me cum, I might flood the block, wet on my socks
I wanna talk about guns niggas don't bust
Y'all need to see me if y'all wanna see shells pop out
Make you say watch out, when I got my glock out
Niggaz clock out, 'cause I run up in your watch house
Snatch up all your rocks out, then throw your box out
Ya motherfuckers better watch out
Yo, let's talk about fake ass bitches
Lying to yourself, you ain't ready for the world mama
Beggin' every second hungry, life drama
Get your own stacks
Why you think these niggaz pussy hungry
'Cause you actin' triflin'
Layin' up, takin' his money, uh
I wanna talk about live or die, fuck you and I
Niggas will fry like stripped bacon, I leave them shakin'
Keep 'em sizzlin', fuckin' with them you might win
But they only got six shots with a barrel that spin
And us our clip is spinning and hittin' all their men
I wanna talk about ride or die
My dogs control confrontation, in any situation
Five niggas on your team, five niggas you replacing
Five niggas used to gleam, five niggas left with Nathan
But their game that we took and now they back to chase it
I wanna talk about biting ass niggas
Let me see y'all niggas catch the flow
Go red-vest with the four-four blow
Ya niggaz gonna hit the ground for sure
Nigga let me know if you want more
If he catch you with a pound to choke, you know
Nigga never die slow, till his eyes close
Then jump on the highway, I go
Man fuck the po-po, them niggas is moving slow mo, come on
Here's the hook, uh
Now Drag gon' show y'all niggas how we lock this shit
Now Eve gonna show y'all niggas how we drop these hits
Now we gonna show y'all niggas how we pop this Cris
Drag E, dash V, on E
Now Drag-on will show ya niggas how we lock this shit
Now Eve gonna show y'all niggas how we drop these hits
Now we gonna show y'all niggas how we pop this Cris
Drag E, dash V, on E
