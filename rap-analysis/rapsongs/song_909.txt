Yeah, hey baby
Put your hand on my heart
Tell me if you ever felt a heartbeat like this
Boom boom boom boom boom
Is the sound that you hear from my heart
Beatin' hard like a bass drum
Zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom
As my blood starts to raise through my veins
All I want is to be close to you
I like you in those boots, you know just what to do
Girl, let me see those tattoos, I'm gon' ride with you
Right here's the perfect place for me to kiss and fuck you
I can't wait to taste your sugar
I wanna taste your body, I wanna taste your face
I wanna taste your breast, taste below your waist
That's some of my many wishes
Fresh out the bubble bath, girl, you taste so delicious
From when you leave to go to work and how you blow me kisses
The way you come back to the crib and cook and wash the dishes
It's kinda hard to fight it once the fire is ignited
You feel my heart beat, baby? You got me so excited
Boom boom boom boom boom
Is the sound that you hear from my heart
Beatin' hard like a bass drum
Zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom
As my blood starts to raise through my veins
All I want is to be close to you
I like you in those boots, you know just what to do
Girl, let me see those tattoos, I'm gon' ride with you
Right here's the perfect place for me to kiss and fuck you
I can't wait to taste your sugar
I can't explain the feelin', it's such an amazin' thing
You're like a prized possession, a gift to any king
Or wings, is only here to protect us
No matter what we go through and how it might affect us
Tired of the lectures, a beat to tell me to chill
But they don't really understand what I'm tryin' to build
But I brush it off as nothin', baby, let me tell you somethin'
Every single time I see you, my adrenalin be rushin'
Boom boom boom boom boom
Is the sound that you hear from my heart
Beatin' hard like a bass drum
Zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom
As my blood starts to raise through my veins
All I want is to be close to you
I like you in those boots, you know just what to do
Girl, let me see those tattoos, I'm gon' ride with you
Right here's the perfect place for me to kiss and fuck you
I can't wait to taste your sugar
Your body's smokin' like a Newport, better yet I'm backwards
You like it in the back seat 'cause baby girl, you're that hood
I never had it how you put it on me
The way you move is makin' me horny
Man, I just wanna kiss ya all over your body
Stretch you like pilates, baby, let's get naughty
Doin' how we do, fuckin' all around the house
Started on the bed and ended up on the couch
Damn, I touch you and you touch me, we get closer
And you hold me like you're holdin' on for dear life
Boldly and we go out on the balcony and let our bodies wrap up
And we fuck until the sun come up
Housekeepin' comes and catch us
I don't care though, you takin' it, I'm givin' it, we breakin' it
Everything up in the room like a tornado in the makin'
And I'm wylin' and I'm racin', baby, let me take you down
And while you give it to me, let me give it back, girl
Listen to the sound as it goes
Boom boom boom boom boom
Is the sound that you hear from my heart
Beatin' hard like a bass drum
