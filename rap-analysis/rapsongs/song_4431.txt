Uhh, 
Yeahh, 
Uh ohh, 
Yehh, 
Hey Barbie, ah, ah, ah, are you into black men? 
He- hey hey hey Barbie! I can be your black ken 
Wow! cause' once you go black, you never go back 
She wore her hair black, with curls in the back 
Then she threw that ass back, back, back 
Then I fell to the mat, and after that 
Everything went black!!! 
(Nicki Minaj Chorus) 
Baby 1, 2, 3 
Tell em get the referee 
Cause he can, get the knockout 
If the telephone rings 
Its emergency 
Cause he can, get the knockout 
Get the knockout 
(Lil Wayne) 
Hey Barbie, can I call you Barbara? haha 
Hey Barbie! can I call you tomorrow, and today? 
Cause' once you go black, you never go back 
And once you go Wayne , everybody else is whack 
She threw that ass back, back, back, then I fell to the mat 
And after that everything went black! 
(Nicki Minaj Chorus) 
Baby 1, 2, 3 
Tell em get the referee 
Cause he can, get the knockout 
If the telephone rings 
Its emergency 
Cause he can, get the knockout 
Get the knockout 
(Nicki Minaj) 
Awe fuck it 
Give me that damn bucket 
Wh-when I throw this pussy 
You better not start duckin 
Oh yo 
He-head on with the blow 
Lo-look out in the crowd 
And everybody's yellin NO! 
Grab him by his locks 
And give us a good box 
Hit him below the belt 
I wanna give him good top 
Top, top 
Give him good top 
Hit him below the belt 
I wanna give him good top 
1,2,3 
They yellin 1,2,3 
I done hit him with that motherfuckin court two piece 
Tell em, tell em to mop out 
To late to cop out 
Give him more head than tupee's like I locked out 
(Nicki Minaj Chorus) 
Baby 1, 2, 3 
Tell em get the referee 
Cause he can, get the knockout 
If the telephone rings 
Its emergency 
Cause he can, get the knockout 
Get the knockout
