Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Just bounce around
All my niggas in the place need to bounce around
Just bounce around, make ya bounce around
All my bitches in the place need to bounce around
Make ya bounce around, I'll make ya bounce around
Shake yo titties and yo ass and bounce around
Just bounce around, just bounce around, c'mon
Yeah nigga this shit here be the boss of me
None of you all niggas is ready run go see the pharmacy
Prepare for the coming of another grand larceny
Pardon me, you niggas ain't even a little hard to me
Shit I spit'll slice you all up in yo main artery
For the simple fact we didn't grow together, you ain't a part of me
Makin' niggas ride my long star singin' the choruses
Open offices they gon' go cop another fortresses
Meet a couple delorises
Travel when we on the low whippin them ford tauruses
Now I be Busta Ryhmes multimedia
Latest edition added to the street encyclopedia
Keep your eyes on greedy niggas gettin' greedier
Keep your eyes on meaty asses gettin' meatier
Worldwide publication bring tribulation
To all whack niggas I smash your dedication
My purpose is to purchase and really hurt this
Bring all of my niggas amongst the wealthy merchants
Gently we conquer the spot until it's empty
Present me and my niggas with arsenal aplenty
Break fools, send you to school, follow the rules
Violate my tools, lay you in your own blood pool
But for now I drop jewels on the mentally strong
With shit to say we don't allow niggas to say up in a song
Aiyyo, aiyyo, hot shit makin' ya bounce
One two ride around in large amounts
One two high offa half an ounce
One two, one two
One two, hot shit makin' ya bounce
One two ride around in large amounts
One two we high offa half an ounce
One two, one two
Caliente, wearing Ferdio Valente
Shorty whippin' in a Mitsubishi Viamonte
Smell the roses, overdoses, givin' niggas they diagnosis
I got the answer for niggas who need they prognosis
Shit for all of you all niggas to smell up in your noses
Hocus pocus, introduce me to the hostess
I was dyin' a stroke uh play strip poker
In the limo as I directed the limo chauffer
Told the nigga to spin over by the Club Copa
Watchin' shorty lay as she spread on the limo sofa
She asked the chauffer to stop for a Frappachino Mocha
Then she let me blaze it while I still had my gun in my holster
Still bonin', word I love the way shorty moanin'
Zonin', word is born niggas is wide open
Yo, have a little fun all in between time
And now we focus on the money shit all in the meantime
Word to mother, I work hard to keep microphonin'
And alert niggas to shit like when the devil started clonin'
What nigga? Yeah, we bowlin' and shit is rollin'
Little shitty-ass niggas should run and go clean ya colon
Any human that be assumin'
I check my nigga Ruben for the ice cuban
Assist him in my Lincoln Ave boomin'
Whats the issue? I come to get you
May the force be with you
Bang your head, rupture your brain tissue
I unravel shit faster than sound travel
Battle any amphibian or live mammal
Don't fret from sunrise to sunset
Make a nigga bounce quick and I ain't even grabbed my gun yet
I ain't done yet before I go to my permanent home
Make sure you put one of the illest on my tombstone
Aiyyo, aiyyo, hot shit makin' ya bounce
One two ride around in large amounts
One two high offa half an ounce
One two, one two
One two hot shit makin' ya bounce
One two ride around in large amounts
One two we high offa half an ounce
One two, one two, one two, one two
One two, one two, one two, one two
One two
