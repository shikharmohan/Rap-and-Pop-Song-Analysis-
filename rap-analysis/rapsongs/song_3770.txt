Everybody knows that they're guilty
Everybody knows that they've lied
Everybody knows that they're guilty
Resting on their conscience eating their inside
It's freedom, said it's freedom time now
It's freedom, said it's freedom time now
Time to get free, oh, give yourselves up now
It's freedom, said it's freedom time
Yo, there's a war in the mind, over territory for the dominion
Who will dominate the opinion, skisms and isms
Keepin' us in forms of religion, conformin' our vision
To the world churches decision trapped in a section
Submitted to committee election, moral infection
Epidemic lies and deception, insurrection of the highest possible order
Distortin' our tape recorders from here and like under water
Beyond the borders fond of sin and disorder
Bound by the strategy, it's systematic depravity, heavy as gravity
Head first in the cavity, without a bottom, a fate worse than Sodom
What's got 'em drunk of the spirits, truth comes, we can't hear it
When you've been, programmed to fear it
I had a vision, I was fallin' in indecision
Apollin', callin' religion, some program on television
How can dominant wisdom be recognized in the system
Of Anti-Christ, the majority rules intelligent fools, PhD's in illusion
Masters of mass confusion, Bachelors in past illusion
Now who you choosin', the head or the tail, the bloodshed of male
Or confidence in the veil, conferences of Yale
Discussin' doctrines of Baal, causin' people to fail
Keepin' the third in jail, His word has nailed
Everything to the tree, severing all of me from all that I used to be
Formless and void, totally paranoid, enjoy darkness as the Lord
Keepin' me from the sword, blocked from mercy, bitter than Ceres
Hungry and thirsty, for good meat we would eat
And still dined at the table of deceit, how incomplete
From confrontation to retreat, we prolong the true enemies defeat
Destitute a necessity causin' desperation to get the best of me
Punishment 'til there was nothing left of me
Realizin' the unescapable death of me
No options in the valley of decision
The only doctrine, supernatural circumcision
Inwardly only water can purge the heart, from words, the fiery darts
Thrown by the workers of the arts, iniquity, shapen in
There's no escapin' when you're whole philosophy is paper thin
In vanity, the wide road is insanity, could it be all of humanity?
Picture that, scripture that, the origin of man's heart is black
How can we show up for an invisible war
Preoccupied with a shadow, makin' love with a whore
Achin' in sores Babylon, the great mystery
Mother of human history, system of social sorcery
Our present condition needs serious recognition
Where there's no repentance there can be no remission
And that sentence, more serious than Vietnam
The atom bomb and Saddam and Minister Farakkhan
What's goin' on, what's the priority to you?
By what authority do we do the majority hasn't a clue
We majored in curses, search the chapters, check the verses
Recapture the land, remove the mark from off of our hands
So we can stand in agreement with his command
Everything else is damned, let them with ears understand
Everything else is damned, let them with ears understand
It's freedom, said it's freedom time now
It's freedom, said it's freedom time now
It's freedom, I'ma be who I am
It's freedom time, said it's freedom time
Everybody knows that they've lied
Everybody knows that they've perpetrated inside
Everybody knows that they're guilty, yes
Resting on their conscience eating their insides
Get free, be who you're supposed to be
Freedom, said it's freedom time now
Freedom, said it's freedom time
Freedom, freedom time now
