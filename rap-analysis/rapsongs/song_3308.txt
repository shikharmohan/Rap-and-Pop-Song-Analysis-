Sex I the morning, sex at night, sex in the afternoon's alright
Ain't a man on earth, that can stay alive
Without a sex drive

I was in a contest to rock the world
First prize was a virgin young girl
For four days I was up on the mic
All sucker MC's were on the bite
Bittin' my rhymes, stealin' my style
Bittin' on the ice like a crocodile
You know I rocked so hard, it wasn't true
Won the virgin girl, and her mama too
Sex
Sex
That's what I want
Sex
Oh yeah
Sex
When I'm upon the microphone
All the fly young ladies want a take me home
Party's over, take me to their house
Throw me in the bed, know what we're talkin' about?
Then they say, "Ice-T you are the best
I love your eyes, your things, your chest
You put all my lovers to shame
I can't remember my boyfriends name"
You made me feel all hot and wet
The way you move I can't forget
I came, I came, I came again
It felt so good I told my friends
You can have my cars, my jewels, my wealth
I love you more than I love myself
After tonight fulfilled I'll be
No hundred men could match Ice-T
Sex
Sex
That's what you wanted
Sex
Sex
Then she turn out the lights, throw back the sheets
And then our two hot bodies meet
All at once she felt the thrill
The caress of the best, the Ice-T chill
Start with her tongue upon the back of my leg
She didn't stop till I hollered screamed and begged
Then she rolled me over, took me to the stage
Like in the nasty book where you tore out the page
Sex
Sex
Sex
That's what I want
Sex
Oh, I put it in their blouse
In their bra, in their little panties that their boyfriend saw
I put it in their mini skirt and up their thigh
Deep, deep girls, I wanna make you cry
I move it in and out, know what I'm talkin' about
Then around your neck until you show respect
Then on your cheek until I reach my peak
Then in your mouth girl, no joke, I'll take it out girl
Don't want to see you choke
I'll run it down your back, might cause a heart attack
I'll put it in your butt until I get enough
And then I'll take it out and put it in my pants
'Cause I fuck with the beat, the only way to dance
