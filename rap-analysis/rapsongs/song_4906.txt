It's gonna get in you, child of the night
And the hood rolls on
How do I begin to do this shit right?
And get my hustle on
It's gonna get in you, child of the night
And the hood rolls on
How do I begin to do this shit right?
And get my hustle on
Look here
Now I'm a man of many talents and a man of my word
But on my path to see the light sometimes my vision gets blurred
It's all a part of growing up and seeing life at its worst
And trying to iron out my wrinkles, putting family first
It seems like the whole world is out for sinking my boat
But with God as my navigator I'll be staying afloat
And I admit to being caught by many foolish distractions
Then I'm forced to pay the price as a result of my actions
I'm battling with myself, and every day is a war
Curiosity killed the cat, why am I curious George?
Gotta keep my nose up out of things that ain't none of my biz
And just 'cause something looks good, don't really mean that it is
Get through the agony and anger, the pain and strife
And take the necessary steps to try to change my life
I've got some questions for you Lord, 'cause my mentality's hood
So why's that everything that's bad for me feels so good?
It's gonna get in you, child of the night
And the hood rolls on
How do I begin to do this shit right?
And get my hustle on
It's gonna get in you, child of the night
And the hood rolls on
How do I begin to do this shit right?
And get my hustle on
Now I'm an only child, so excuse some of my selfish ways
I got spoiled when I was young, spoil myself today
But I feed at least a thousand stomachs and how I've done it is
From the ground up a hundred miles and running, dodging and ducking
Everybody trying to hammer me down
A self made millionaire, baby look at me now
Can't tell me I'm not as hungry as the day I began
'Cause all I ever really needed was a pen in my hand
And the pad in my lap didn't matter in fact
Me and my mom lived in one room, what's badder than that?
Was a young man forced to grow up at the age of twelve
Trying to get in where I fit, streets giving me hell
But yet I give it right back, so how you like that?
Continued doing wrong till I was on the right track
Tell me about heavy money, I might give it a push
But a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
It's gonna get in you, child of the night
And the hood rolls on
How do I begin to do this shit right?
And get my hustle on
It's gonna get in you, child of the night
And the hood rolls on
How do I begin to do this shit right?
And get my hustle on
No matter how much older we get
Man, we are all still children at heart
We all make mistakes, it's all good
Now, I've tried plenty of times to get rid of my bad habits
Living life on the cutting edge, taking a stab at it
And learning from my mistakes, try not to make them twice
Just admit it when I'm wrong, and tryin' hard to make it right
And baby, nobody's perfect in this world of ours
There's plenty of people getting stitches in this world of scars
But over time I pray to God that he can heal your wounds
Try and love and love again until they seal your tomb
Life is short if you don't notice it'll pass you by
That's why my head is in the clouds trying to pass the sky
I'm never blinking for a minute, keep my eyes on my foes
They wanna catch me in the open, bring my life to a close
Meanwhile that's why I'm bringing so much life to my shows
I've seen smiles, I'm making changes, turning glitter to gold
Don't let these devils play you down, or belittle your souls
Just be happy with yourself and it's so simple to grow
Come on
It's gonna get in you, child of the night
And the hood rolls on
How do I begin to do this shit right?
And get my hustle on
