And the radio daze kept us in the dark
And the satellite age brings us to the light
Some feelin' the pitch, some feelin' the bite
They ain't ready to talk, they're ready to fight
Never leave you alone
Never, never leave you alone
Never, never leave you alone
Never leave you alone
Never, never leave you alone
Never, never leave you alone
Yo, so what you searchin' for?
From birth born hurtin' and yearnin' for certain somethings
Lurkin' and murk 'em, got them turnin' this bed into a coffin
Burning over passions in this passion
Or more or less over what the past done passed us
'Cause see, the past tense, it never really passes
Phases that trap us and cage us like classes
Foggin' my glasses, lost in a mass mess
Task-less dilemma to match somebody's status
And I'm average as fuck, no car cats gassin' me up
Passin' bucks like a casual blunt
Granted hustlin' habits on the stumble, the mansion
While bums pass, askin' for a buck for some bagged bricks
Bad shit goin' down on the daily
While bad chicks pass in a Mercedez, damn
They say he's the bastard for chasin' 'em
Maybe, it's the patterns that make me that made me crazy
And the radio daze kept us in the dark
And the satellite age brings us to the light
Some feelin' the pitch, some feelin' the bite
They ain't ready to talk, they're ready to fight
Never leave you alone
Never, never leave you alone
Never, never leave you alone
Never leave you alone
Never, never leave you alone
Never, never leave you alone
Life is fiction, competition and contradiction
Petty perceptions, window dressing for misdirection
Love is a lotto, I know I know you know what I know
Hope is so hollow that's why winos follow the bottle
And people pressure make death a hidden treasure
A girly pleasure, lonely language inside a letter
It's now or never, move it, move it, love it or lose it
'Fore it's recruited, then included inside the stupid
It's things of nature, paid a player and say your prayers
Naysayers, the haters, the major players, the beggars
You 'bout it, 'bout it, don't allow it to pow without it
Then those who doubt it, do or die to death are cowards
The world is yours, and the world we can't afford
So ignore the law, start a fire, then start a war
If you're sick and tired of your access denied
Free will died long before Glydes and iPod
And the radio daze kept us in the dark
And the satellite age brings us to the light
Some feelin' the pitch, some feelin' the bite
They ain't ready to talk, they're ready to fight
Never leave you alone
Never, never leave you alone
Never, never leave you alone
Never leave you alone
Never, never leave you alone
Never, never leave you alone
Yo, it's too much strain, phenomenal gain
I'm goin' through things, headaches, abdominal pain
Tryin' to numb it with that kettle like I'm from the Ukraine
Check the blue flame, lighter runnin' out of butane
What's up with my destructive urge that's unproductive?
Choices I'm stuck with now startin' to fuck with
Contaminating family and close friends
Tellin' me to stop burnin' the candle at both ends
Ain't like I'm on a coke binge, hangin' in dope dens
Or life is just a pool of Patron I'm soaked in
The darker the covenant-slash-trainwreck for you to rubberneck
You ain't felt the true pain yet so you be lovin' that
Hit me up at black.gov like the government
Banana Republican, alien intelligence
Kill switch, real pissed, thinkin' of some ill shit
The stone the builder refused, he need to build with
Got immunized for both flus, I'm still sick
Via satellite, radio, the realness
And the radio daze kept us in the dark
And the satellite age brings us to the light
Some feelin' the pitch, some feelin' the bite
They ain't ready to talk, they're ready to fight
And the radio daze
And the radio daze
And the radio daze
