Sitting on my porch sippin' on Jim Beam
Read the newspaper man, guess what I seen
Shit bad enough to make a grown man scream
And then I woke up, this is not a bad dream
I don't really wanna talk about it
'Cause every time I talk about it, I go off about it
And every time I get like that I wanna start somebody
This world really got you thinking that you are somebody
So what? You got a gun, I don't give a fuck about it
I would take every bullet and every buck up out it
So motherfucker, cock it back and please buck away
'Cause right now I'm feeling "fuck you"
And fuck today, fuck today
Fuck "everything gonna be alright", fuck "ok"
'Cause I'm feeling like I had about enough today
'Cause I'm feeling like I had about enough today
I say fuck today, fuck today
Fuck "everything gonna be alright", fuck "ok"
'Cause I'm feeling like I had about enough today
'Cause I'm feeling like I had about enough today
Don't you see that this whole world is my stage?
And I must perform to the best of my abilities, yeah
Motherfuckers talking away, but we don't care what they say
We taking this day by day
Man, I woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning
And my tank on "E" plus the gas prices soaring
Baby momma trippin', tryin' to get me for my money
Now she laughing to the bank and ain't a damn thing funny
My momma lights off and my daddy don't call
And my nigga got killed, man, I miss my dawg
The landlord buggin' and the rent keep coming
And the heater broke and I gotta warm my house with the oven
Every time I think about it, man, it get depressing
And the stock market down, the whole country in recession
Plus the cops got a warrant out, they trying to arrest me
Man, this whole day startin' to stress me, nigga, so
Fuck today, fuck today
Fuck "everything gonna be alright", fuck "ok"
'Cause I'm feeling like I had about enough today
'Cause I'm feeling like I had about enough today
So fuck today, fuck today
Fuck "everything gonna be alright", fuck "ok"
'Cause I'm feeling like I had about enough today
'Cause I'm feeling like I had about enough today
Don't you see that this whole world is my stage?
And I must perform to the best of my abilities, yeah
Motherfuckers talking away, but I don't care what they say
We taking this day by day
Ok, these are the days, the days of our lives
Where do you have a calendar, because I lost mine
Uh, I lost mine, uh, I lost mine
I'm the sickest virus on and offline
Imaginary line, you don't wanna cross mine
Found a clock in the street, I'm making up for lost time
Third eye blind but it's still "fuck the bullshit"
Knowing what I got, but more conscious of what I could get
Tired of the same shit, don't know who to blame shit
And we knew a black president wouldn't change shit
Money still a language, well, ain't nobody talkin'
They found my calender in the garbage, so
Fuck today, fuck today
Fuck "everything gonna be alright", fuck "ok"
'Cause I'm feeling like I had about enough today
'Cause I'm feeling like I had about enough today
I say fuck today, fuck today
Fuck "everything gonna be alright", fuck "ok"
'Cause I'm feeling like I had about enough today
Don't you see that this whole world is my stage?
And I must perform to the best of my abilities, yeah
Motherfuckers talking that shit, we gonna have to see what I did
'Cause I don't give a fuck about it and I don't give a shit about you
I don't give a damn about you
And I don't give a shit about you
Mother-fuck you, mother-fuck me
And fuck today, fuck today
Fuck "everything gonna be alright", fuck "ok"
Fuck "everything gonna be alright", fuck "ok"
Fuck "everything gonna be alright", fuck "ok"
Hey, fuck today, hey, fuck today
Hey, fuck today, hey, fuck today
Fuck "everything gonna be alright", fuck "ok"
Fuck "everything gonna be alright", fuck "ok"
Sitting on my porch sippin' on Jim Bean
Read the newspaper, man, guess what I seen?
Shit bad enough to make a grown man scream
And then I woke up, this is not a bad dream
Young mula crazy
