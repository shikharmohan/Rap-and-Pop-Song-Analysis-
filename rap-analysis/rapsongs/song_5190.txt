{You've been lucky, I wish I got you last time
En Garde, I'll let you try my Wu-Tang style
I'd like to try your Wu-Tang style, let's begin then!}
From the tip top?

Check it, I got styles, all of 'em sick
Niggaz ain't fit to walk a mile in the dead man's kicks
I make em shit about a pile, of bricks to show
He ain't nuttin' but another, a lone John Doe
That wanna flow, here it is, comin' up shit's creek
I come to throw monkey wrenches in your program, sleep
And I'ma grow, like a rash on ya nasty ass
In a whip, with no breaks and I'm hittin' the gas
It's a bird, it's a plane, take a look in the sky
Method Man on some shit, niggaz call me 'The Fly'
'Cause my style, dates back to hoppin' turn styles
Make ya fear, if ya cutie in the chair, you can bet I'll
Get severe on the double I harass it
I don't look for trouble, I'm already trouble
Ya bastard, check the wicked flows that I crafted
Open up a deadly venom style to be mastered
By a psychopathic, way beyond an average
Joe, with a hellafied flow, there ya have it
What's that shit
That they be smokin'?
Tical, tical, tical
Pass it over here
Tical, tical, tical

Tical, tical, tical
One two, uh, one two, one two
One two, uh, one two, one two
One two, uh, one two, one two
One two, uh, check it out
What goes off? What goes on? The Meth shit
That we got is to stay high, no question
Lethal weapon, ain't no time for half steppin'
When brothers start wettin' everything in ya section
Move that, niggaz came strapped, shoulda knew that
Do dat, pussy cat rap, boy, I'll screw that
To' up, from the flow up, don't even show up
To the battle, I heard you rattle now hold up
Is there a fuckin' snake in my garden?
Starvin', for a rap treat, steppin' on my feet
Pardon yo delf, before ya find yo delf
In a fucked up situation, without no help
I'm not playin', 'cause I don't play with nobody
God damn kid, know what I'm sayin', I'm peelin' niggas wigs
I be sprayin', brother with words
Cause I got a spit problem
Tical, tical, tical
Pass it over here then
Tical, tical, tical
What's that shit then
The niggaz smokin'?
Tical, tical, tical
Pass it over here
Tical, tical, tical
One two uh, one two, one two
One two uh
