[Intro: Redman (Hurricane G)]
ONE, TWO, THREE, YOO!! (YOO!!)
[Verse 1: Redman (Hurricane G)]
Kick in the door, then I yell, "DON'T MOVE!"
C.O.'s is like, "yo, who the fuck is this dude?"
I give ya a little hint, it's the Soopamanluva
Took the shotgun from him, then I shot that fucker
Threw it to Hurricane, she like ("Yea, let's do it!")
Snatched up a reporter that was here to interview her
Raised up one of his hands, put a bullet through it
Took off his Franck Muller, so Daily News know the time it took to rescue her
We goin' out the front door
Hurricane shotgun, hand lettin' the pump off
Bitches see it, and started wylin' in the mess hall
("Fuck the Warden! We gon' get you muhfucka!")
Ayyo, told you I was comin'
[Verse 2: Hurricane G (Redman)]
Nigga, I ain't never scared
I ain't givin' no state time for shit I didn't did (WOOO!)
Give me some more ammo, the front door's near
We two barrels smoke (with a hostage in here)
[Verse 3: Redman (Hurricane G)]
Yo G, you lock and LOAD? (Lock and load!)
Plan came together like the Eleven and Bellagio
We out the front door, Warden, shotty blow
I mash the gas 'til me and G is "adios!" ("Adios!")
That's how that Soopamanluva get down
(Yea, that's how that bitch Hurricane get down) Get down
[Outro: Melanie Rutherford (Redman)]
Ohhh, oh oh oh oh ohhh (Gilla House niggas)
Ohh ohhh, (Yo Hurricane G! Glad to have you back girl!)
Ohhh (yea yea yea yea yea yea)
Ohh, ohhh (Gilla Gilla Gilla Gilla)
(Gilla House, Melanie, E3)
Ohh, ohhh (Like I told you nigga)

Ohhh, oh oh oh oh ohhh (Gilla house)
