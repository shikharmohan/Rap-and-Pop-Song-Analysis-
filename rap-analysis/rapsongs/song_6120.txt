Yes, I got you started, yes, I got you started
Uh, yeah, this is on some 'Can It Be, C.R.E.A.M.' shit
Right here, too, yeah, word up, take it there for these niggas
You know? Word up, yo, uh, huh, reminisce, nigga
Word up, nice sunny day, rainy day
Preferable for you and yours, let's blow, yo
Who would've thought I would of made it, y'all?
Ten years later, still in the gid game
The Clan, we was one the greatest
We did platinum back in '93, we painted pictures you could see
We was living who y'all trying to be
RZA had a vision, instead of cooking coke in the kitchen
He told the God, hit the booth and start spitting
At first it was a dream to me, Ol' Earth bugging
Put your gun down, screaming that the streets is gon' be needing me
I did the 'Knowledge to the Wisdom' that you spoke to me
The Wu become us, the world embraced us
A new day, a new life for the God
Got a hood thing, watching 'Ice Water' evolve
Destined to build a mountain, niggaz is doubting my work
Black millionaire, check what I'm worth
I gotta thank y'all for taking in Lex, I appreciate it
I apologize for keeping y'all waiting
Yes, I got you started all over again
Yes, I got you started all over again
(Word up, let's go back, finish up)
Growing up, we've been through hard times
Life on the streets, just trying to survive
Plus my niggas got mouths to feed
We sold to crack fiends, coke, ice and money machines
Shooting at cops, them maggots tried to stop our C.R.E.A.M
But it won't stop, can't stop, my niggas locked down in a box
I feel your pain, I know you're trying to come home
All that weak bullshit, I had to leave it alone
Heard my mom's crying at night, we rap on the phone, I love you
Never meant to stress you out, do you wrong, yo, I'm working
Then move you from a block to a home
We came from nothing, seeing how the world is so cold
Some niggas coming out of churches selling Devil their soul, yo
My neighborhood is Crime Central, sort of like prisons and cops
One on lock, instead of trying to defend you
All that bullshit we've been through
Time to draw the line right here,
Got to stop now, time is the issue
Yes, I got you started all over again
Yes, I got you started all over again
(One more jewel, one more, move, let's go, let's go)
It's time to rebuild, teach our seeds that guns don't kill
It's the nigga behind the trigger that will
Society's ill, blacks support seeds for their mills
Mentally brainwashed, time moves on, we stand still
I seen life through the birth of my son, I seen it all again
A soldier stuck in these streets, hoping it's war within
Too late to fall now, I'm on now
Niggas is born now, we doing good, we on tour now
Elevate your prosperity, I'm seeing shit with clarity
No longer on the low, pa, I couldn't handle thieves
Too much to live for, I just wanna poly and grow
Stack ones and watch my little dun's blow
Yes, I got you started all over again
Yes, I got you started all over again
Yes, I got you started all over again
Yes, I got you started all over again
