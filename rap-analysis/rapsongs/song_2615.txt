[[Verse 1]]
Uh Yea
U know them nights when u looking good
When it all come together sexy head to toe like u know u should
Body banging got they tongues hanging
Got em lined up wanting your atttention
But u like to keep em waiting
Riding through they screaming sexy
But u keep it movin constantly smiling at em come and get me
Alot of dudes ain't got the courage
So till they get it up live it up mami that don't keep u worried
Attention something that u get
Not something that u need 
Unless u spot the dude that makes u weak (then)
If that's the case gotta let it flow
Get close to em let em in yo ear this is what u hear
[[Chorus: Robin Thicke]]
All i want is u only u
You're my fantasy
Girl u know that i wanna do things to u
Nobody else gets to do
U Only u you're my fantasy
Girl u know that i wanna make it come true
I wanna make it come true
[[Verse 2]]
Yuh My body your body touching and sweating
Kissing and tugging
I swear it get's no better than the tugging
Love it when it's perfect tell me what u want
Eyes met mine and it was on
Wanted to take me home
Told me that u wanna make me moan
I was up for it already 
Just to let u take charge
I was feeling kinda freaky
And im knowing u the cause
Told me just to lay back
Relax close my eyes it'll be alright
Know im feeling that
Guess i was yo plan for the night
Guess wat ima let u be my man for the night
[[Chorus: Robin Thicke]]
All i want is u only u
You're my fantasy
Girl u know that i wanna do things to u
Nobody else gets to do
U Only u you're my fantasy
Girl u know that i wanna make it come true
I wanna make it come true
