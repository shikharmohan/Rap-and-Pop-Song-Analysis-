Of course we have just accepted all applications
And tuition will be paid on Friday [unverified]
You you can't can't be be ripping the mic the mic
Like do re me me measles are contagious
Like my lyrical pages ripping and flipping the mic
From back in the back in the days the days
It's kinda hectic, hectic when these suckas
Don't respect it check it, flame on
I know the light is bright but keep on watching me
I'm stolen property, kicking the flavor to society
Police be clocking me, but logically they got to be
'Cause they were taught that serious poetry
Would come from Socrates
But that ain't it, in 94 I'll kick the hit
And if I was in front of Shakespeare
Battle a punk and take his shit, I'm not having it
Bust a narrative and come to get with it
Rap is something you do, hip hop is something you live
The difference is kids nowadays, they got the videos
Rappers don't need skills to build so they don't really know.
Hear me yo, I'm four times on Arsenio
Got ten videos, but does that help me flow? No
That's why when I come to the show MC's act like they don't know
'Cause they were too young to rock up in the disco
Frisco disco, the disc is like a Nabisco
Chocolate chip cookie, don't fuck with me rookie
I'm rocking beats and with death defying feats
And I'm never sneaking, always peeping when I'm speaking
Inside, I'm keeping a statement for police and
I'm down for peace and but not turn the other cheek
And so this DJ, he gets down mixing records
While they go 'round and 'round, 'round we go
Two years ago a friend of mine and Flash is gonna rock your mind
Welcome to the terror dome, the terror dome
I wonder if I take you home E F F E C T a cool operator
Operating correctly but back in the day I knew rap would never die
Too late baby bwai bai in a body boy head, head
Head insane in the membrane take the train, take the train
M E T H O D man 'hattan keeps on making it
Brooklyn keeps on taking it
We keep coming back with more and more hits
Party people, I came through the door, I said it before
Two years ago, super hoe if my train goes off the track
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up back, back
Back to the grill again, the grill again friends
How many MC's must get dissed?
Before somebody says don't fuck with Chris
Hey, ho, keep on moving don't stop no body beats the biz
Let's do the dance called the Pee Wee Herman
Hey, Erick Sermon, hey, you you get off my cloud
Go down baby, go down baby, the gods must be crazy
You ain't fresh, you ain't fresh, yeah
