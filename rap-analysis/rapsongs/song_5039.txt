Food & Liquor
Yeah, my man said he wanted
Somethin' real, real, real, real, real
Somethin' he could recognize
Somethin' he could feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
Baby girl said she was in the mood
For somethin' real, real, real, real, real
Somethin' that could make her move
Somethin' she could feel, feel, feel, feel
Lust sometimes can override trust
She said that's why she gave it up
My man said blood spilled out of everything he touched
He crushed everything he crushed
Ruined everything he loved, he just wanted to rush
Blamed it on the times bein' rough
Doin' dirt with the Devil, chasin' after the dust
Make a fuss if it's them, but we hush if it's us
That's why, my momma said she wanted
Somethin' real, real, real, real, real
Somethin' she could be proud of
Somethin' she could feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
She said they so used to not havin'
Nothin' real, real, real, real, real
That they don't know how to act
They don't know how to feel, feel, feel, feel
Life ain't meant to come around twice
Yeah, that's why I gotta get it right
They said I got it honest, now I gotta give it light
But sleep on it, that's why God give you night
I mean, I had a dream that God gave me flight
Too fly for my own good, so God gave me plight
If I wake up in the mornin', now I gotta give 'em sight
Make 'em see, break 'em free, ain't a G
Sho' you right, sho' you right
The game is not to give 'em
Nothin' real, real, real, real, real
Nothin' they could use
Nothin' that they could feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
Give 'em a bunch of lies and teach 'em
That it's real, real, real, real, real
So that's all that they know
That's all that they feel, feel, feel, feel
Struggle, yeah, yeah, another sign that God love you
'Cause on the low, bein' po' make you humble
Keep they names in my rhymes to try and keep 'em out of trouble
'Cause bein' po' also teach you how to hustle
All they want is some shoes or some rims for they bubble
Now that I got my own, I can hit them with a couple
Cuff my homies so they ain't got no reason to cuff you
That's my plan, if I can, on the man, up above you
That's why, I gotta give 'em
Somethin' real, real, real, real, real
Somethin' they could recognize
Somethin' they could feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
To my homies on the block, I gotta give 'em
Somethin' real, real, real, real, real
Somethin' that'll make 'em stop
Somethin' they can feel, feel, feel, feel
Yo, FNF for real, really real, yeah
Know what it is, woo
Baby girl said she was in the mood
For somethin' real, real, real, real, real, let's go
So real, so real
So real, so real
So real, so real
