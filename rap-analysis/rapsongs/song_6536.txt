Back by popular demand
Dope pound gangsta feel
Want a real DJ, with a OGA
A bitch is a bitch, whether she poor or rich
She still gettin' a gang of dicks
It don't matter what you do or say
'Cause bitch you can't change my feelin's no way
I've been across the whole U.S.A.
Same ol' hoes on different days
Just ask my big homeboy Snoop de Snoop
Bitch you ain't cute with all that, woop de woop
I might just rock ya, I ain't afraid to blast
I might rock a fella like Dame and dash
Grip the heater and slap your ass
Cock it back, automatic clap your ass
Now this is how a gangster mash out
The homies in the Coupe, me and Snoop in the glass house
Bouncin', bouncin', bouncin', swervin'
Blaze up a whole ounce and get the ramen with the cotton candy
Yeah, and all my niggaz say, ride on, ride on
Yeah, and all the homies say, ride on
Yeah, and all the bitches say, ride on
Yeah, and all the robbers say, ride on, can't get caught up
Yeah, and all my niggaz say, ride on, ride on
Yeah, and all the homies say, ride on
Yeah, and all the bitches say, ride on
I'm out to paper count the paper bump some bitches and move
I take a trip with my click on a three day cruise
Spank the corner in the fo', sittin' low gettin' low
Now we headed to the sto' in the fo', hoes holler
Top dollar with the gold flea collar dippin' in my blue Impala
They say Snoop Dogg is a fool 'cause he got the bitches
And the little homey sellin' weed up outta high school
I never ever break the law, I just bend it
Keep everythin' splendid, that's how I intend it
Class is in session, you might get suspended, shh
If you don't shut the fuck up and listen for a minute
I've been in it for life with two kids and a wife
With no tattooes just stress and stripes, so
I'ma do what I feel and do what I like
But I won't go to sleep without my heater at night, ride on
Yeah, and all my niggaz say, ride on, ride on
Yeah, and all the homies say, ride on
Yeah, and all the bitches say, ride on
Yeah, and all the robbers say, ride on, can't get caught up
Yeah, and all my niggaz say, ride on, ride on
Yeah, and all the homies say, ride on
Yeah, and all the bitches say, ride on
Nigga gimme evrything you got, from your hat
To your contacts, T-shirt to your socks
Dogg Pound affiliate, Hell naw nigga
Certified branded Cedar Paul nigga
Mashin', grey and blue all day
All night all heated with heaters, Mac-11's
Nine millimeters, whattup Big Nate
I got a bitch that gobble up dicks like steak
She lives upstate and I don't think
Near a one of those bitches is proper, stash the chopper
DPology, D P G but first call Snoop
Whattup big homey niggaz with the swoop
The homey jumps in whips out the four pound
When we get there, we shakin' all motherfucker down
It's what I had in mind, let's get paid hit the spot
Just like a raid one of the homies got a gauge, come on
Yeah, and all my niggaz say, ride on, ride on

I mean this game is gettin' real deep
We got niggaz that be misrepresentin'
I mean, motherfuckers you know thinkin' that DPG
Is a motherfuckin' football game or a football team or somethin'
Niggaz walkin' on and shit like they free agents
And just leavin' when they want to nigga this ain't no game
This is a motherfuckin' way of life
DPGC, Dogg Pound Gangsta, nigga
The fuck wrong with these niggaz man?
Niggaz be straight tryin' to put they little twist down, holla at 'em
But you know we tryin' to stay two steps
Ahead of the game baby, y'know?
Let me holler at y'all for a minute, especially you
You done stepped in some Dogg Shit, check your shoes
Nigga this ain't Hollywood, the House of Blues
It's the Dogg House so regroup your troops
And tell 'em it's Kurupt and Snoop
Fuck your crew it's on I take your Brome
It's Don Corleone in the Chronic zone
I turn your dubs into nickels while I'm chillin'
I melt your rhymes into icicles while I'm killin'
Sell 'em, I tell 'em, Kurupt, what's up?
I know you feel like givin' it up
We can't stop, won't stop, what for
'Cause every other day another nigga tryin' to pull a dulo
You know when I was fuckin' with the hood
It was all bad, thought it was all good
A nigga had to take a breather now I'm Living Single
Like Khadijah 'cause they'll squeeze ya
Fuck a feedin' fish, I put my dick in your bitch
And make a wish, ha hah
Nigga that's gangsta shit with the gangsta twist
Yeah, Dogg Pound gangsta
