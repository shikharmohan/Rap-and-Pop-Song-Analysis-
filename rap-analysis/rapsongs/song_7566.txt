[Intro: Young Jeezy]
Yeah, this be the realest **** I never wrote
I ain't write this **** by the way n*****, some real s*** right here 
This'll be the realest s*** you ever quote
Let's go!
[Hook: Young Jeezy}
My president is black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be ******** if my rims ain't too
My momma ain't at home, and daddy's still in jail
Tryna make a plate, anybody seen the *****?
My president is black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be ******** if my rims ain't too
My money's light green and my Jordans light grey
And they love to see *****, now how much you tryna pay?
Let's go!
[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
Today was a good day, hope I have me a great night
I don't know what you fishin for but catch you a great *****
Me, I see great *****, heavy as killer whales
I cannot believe this, who knew it came in *****
Who knew what came with jail, who knew what came with prison
Just cause you got opinions, does that make you a politician?
Bush robbed all of us, would that make him a criminal?
And then he cheated in Florida, would that make him a seminal?
I say and I quote, "We need a miracle"
And I say a miracle cause this **** is hysterical
By my nephews and nieces, I will email Jesus
Tell him forward to Moses and CC Allah
Mr. Soul Survivor, guess that make me a Konvict
Be all you can be, now don't that sound like some dumb ****
When you die over crude oil as black as my **** Boo
It's really a Desert Storm, that's word to my ****** Clue
Catch me in Las Vegas, A.R. Arizona
Rep for them real *****, I'm winnin in California
Winnin in Tennessee, hands down Atlanta
Landslide Alabama, on my way to Sevana
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
I said I woke up this morning, headache this big
Pay all these **** bills, feed all these **** kids
Buy all these school shoes, buy all these school clothes
For some strange reason my son addicted to Polos
Love me some spinach dip, I'm addicted to Houston's
And if them numbers is right I take a trip out to Houston
An earthquake out in China, a hurricane in New Orleans
Street Dreams Tour, I showed my *** in New Orleans
Did it for Soulja Slim, brought out B.G.
It's all love Bun, I'm forgivin you Pimp C
You know how the Pimp be, that **** gon' speak his mind
If he could speak down from heaven he'd tell me stay on my grind
Tell him I'm doin fine, Obama for mankind
We ready for **** change so y'all let the man shine
Stuntin on Martin Luther, feelin just like a king
Guess this is what he meant when he said that he had a dream
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Nas]
Yeah, our history, black history, no president ever did **** for me
Had to hit the streets, had to **** some **** so a **** won't go broke
Then they put us in jail, now a ***** can't go vote
So I spend doe, on these **** that *******
She ain't a politician, honey's a *******
My president is black, rolls golden charms
Twenty-two inch rims like Hulk Hogan's arms
When thousands of peoples is riled up to see you
That can arouse ya ego, we got mouths to feed so
Gotta stay true to who you are and where you came from
Cause at the top will be the same place you hang from
No matter how big you can ever be
For whatever fee or publicity, never lose your integrity
For years there's been surprise horses in this stable
Just two albums in, I'm the realest **** on this label
Mr. Black President, yo Obama for real
They gotta put your face on the five-thousand dollar bill
[Hook]
