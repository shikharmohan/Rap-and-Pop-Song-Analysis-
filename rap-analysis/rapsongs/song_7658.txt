Matter fact, my bottom bitch love to ride pine
She know when daddy leave the block, that it's cut time

We fold hoes up, like slacks in the player path
Pretty skin, silky hair, plus that ass fat, uh huh
Fresh kicks on your feet, ya I'm diggin' that
Slick consako, yo boys slingin' wood bitch
You want that straight drop dick
