My game's so strong, I can't go wrong
My dough's so raw, baby why prolong
Maybe we get high, maybe we get dumb
Maybe we can party all night till death come
My game's so strong, I can't go wrong
My dough's so raw, baby why prolong
Maybe we get high, maybe we get dumb
Maybe we can party all night till death come
We've been in the game for a long time, yes we're battle tested
With the time and the emotion and the money invested
And everything hard, no one else's game is tighter
Check the network, I've been your fuckin' service provider
I brought you thug shit, taught you drug shit, got you bugged shit
Tell me what we haven't done, we run you through the gambit, son
Leave you understandin' what the street life is
But you haters never understand, so eat my dick
You better keep your concentration, if you're ready to roll on me
And good bitches if you wanna unload on me
'Cause if you miss, you won't get that far
I'm happy jumpin' fences and runnin' down the street, like a track star
I'm at the finish line, it's essential, I'm so influential
We'll strip you off your street credential
Game recognize, game read all about it
You think you blew them in his spine, look homie, I doubt it for real
My game's so strong, I can't go wrong
My dough's so raw, baby why prolong
Maybe we get high, maybe we get dumb
Maybe we can party all night till death come
My game's so strong, I can't go wrong
My dough's so raw, baby why prolong
Maybe we get high, maybe we get dumb
Maybe we can party all night till death come
They call me dog, homie look it, I don't sell wolf tickets
I got my fingers on the triggers and I'm ready to click it
I never back down, there's nothing' you could do to me nigga
Who the fuck are you? Your face is really new to me nigga
You wanna run with the dog, try payin' your two songs
Punk niggas bailin' every time, that I use chrome
So many niggas ain't none of 'em last
The bright lights in the woods be stunnin' their ass
I took a chance to advance in my life, believe it
It takes a stand to be a man, busters can't conceive it
Fools tryin' to be hard, they only act the role
You little sorry ass bitches, I'll smack you hoes
Tryin' to foam people, make 'em think you're somethin' you're not
I'm exposin' all you bitches, by provokin' the dot
No more talkin', time for some action, drama
Ya been shot down, bullets through your plastic armor
My game's so strong, I can't go wrong
My dough's so raw, baby why prolong
Maybe we get high, maybe we get dumb
Maybe we can party all night till death come
My game's so strong, I can't go wrong
My dough's so raw, baby why prolong
Maybe we get high, maybe we get dumb
Maybe we can party all night till death come
