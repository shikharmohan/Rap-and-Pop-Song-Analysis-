Verse 1:
He say she say naw fuck dat let me say overdose on it cause life seems so much better in slow motion
lying in the ocean with the angel fishes Im all twisted up and thrown away rained down tha drain dispose my soul into the cold winter snow of Chicago and feel me when the wind blows... that Styrofoam got me gone in zone Im so cold feeling all alone well not by myself cuz I got me yea and despite all the lies I tried when ya look me in the eyes tell me that you love me so cuz if u dont when I die I will come back and haunt am I the villain to be killing cuz I fucked up so now Im chilling just me and my drank up in the cup sipping it all up
Bridge:
one mo sip and I will be free
Keep my head inside tha bottle
spend my life in constant sorrow
but sometimes I pretend that im fine.
Hook:
one mo sip will free my mind
it will take me away somewhere far beyond and leave this world behind.
it will take me away
Verse 2:
one more sip of this here codeine might be the end for me
sipping down that slow motion that Styrofoam got me gone in my zone
overdosing off this late night intoxication keep my head in the the bottle inhaling exhaling exhausted I lost it barely breathing mo like wheezing from tha weed n tha drinking and leaning is got me thinking
I need to slow it down and take it ounce by ounce
But I cant and I wont
I will be strung on forever I will go on forever as long as I
study high like astrology aint no stopping me never will gona be sorry for this oh sad story no Maury just downn downn the quicker picker upper
