[Chorus: repeat 3X]
C-town's how we ride
Chi-town's how we ride
Midwest how we ride
Come see how we ride
[Verse: Twista]
now feel the devastation
and unification of the thugs in the middle of the map
these niggas finna snap
spit it for niggas that bit it
then give them the business they gonna feel it when we jack
and be quick with it, be crack
hit it with the lyrical accuracy and harmony I'ma see who
I ain't fuckin' with the Midwest
you could try attackin' me and bombin'
me I'ma be spittin' so fast, they wanna ask how he did that?
Bone Thugs and we gotta spit a hard flow
it's worthy competition everywhere that I go
but ain't no messin' with cleveland or chicago
Ballin' through the hood in a Murcielago
Or Gallardo, or Ferrari, or Diablo
As long as the car go quick, flow so sick
Thought it was drama between Bone and Twista we do it like this
[Chorus]
[Verse: Layzie]
I'm from a place, really ain't safe, Cleveland the birthplace
Midwest niggas, yeah, we stay thirsty
tim's in the winter with the j's in the summer
all four season's we stay workin'
ride with a g'
come and slide with a g'
with the true's on the lac we can ride to the beat
light it up, let it burn when you vibin' with me
gotta keep it real to survive in these streets
come see it for your self how live it can be
MILWAUKEE to the chi back down to the d
michigan, illinois, sho-nuff killa boys
standin' on the corner at 10 degrees
we got pimps, dope pushers, and petty thieves
crooked ass cops won't let me breathe
all my love for the city won't let me leave
what they expect from me?
they want the best from me
they gonna get it, yeah
[Chorus]
[Verse: Krayzie]
I think it's time we show them bone, how we ride
and let everyone know just where we come from Midwest bounce
it's that bounce
that make a nigga feel it when he off that ounce
of the mary mary mary jane
we the niggas showin' them different side of thangs
never seen a nigga that switched the rhyme this way
now everybody run and flip they style today
yup it's kinda strange but
a nigga got to give it up to the Midwest
who made 'em pick up the page before they get left
get a little bit of Twista and hit that
roll it up with some bone thug sit back
just feel the vibe
and ya never let a player hater kill ya high
with this shit we be spittin' we gon' steal ya mind
once again it's the Midwest side (West-side)
[Chorus]
[Verse: Wish]
you can tell by the way I walk, the way I flow from around here
nigga Midwest where the weed ain't the best but we came up
now we get flew from the West coast, (West coast baby)
we flow fast
so many words in one bar
we spit it, rap it, nigga better go hard
who the underdogs
the West done done it
the East done done it
the South hard
they keep it together, (together)
on the same level
Midwest got the weapons
it's ours here them thugsta's, no care
we like to fight, (fight)
on the West we get right, (right)
in the East it's about they favorite night
in the South it's whatever ya like
[Chorus]
