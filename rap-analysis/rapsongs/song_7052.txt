Cope the circumference to get the duckets
When I touch this, deluxe this nycs throughout my bloodstream
So when I steam, all I dream is cream
Wrap my seed in jewels
Stay a brother the all means
Acgo the weather
My crazy clique is too clever
You should know to come better
'Cuz we taking loss never
Post the notes of exotics
Take you back to the tropics
'Cuz you led on a tour by the three black prophets
We rock this
Slap you wit' the mo bat sound track-slap
JB's is official back on the matt
Got the Mike G, got the Sammy B
Got the A to the double to the B
Like earth wind and fire never will retire
This time around, ya gonna call messiah
On the live wire bouncin' like a rubber tire
Ninety seven gonna go to heaven and higher
We known throughout the jungle as the Jungle Brothers
We known throughout the jungle as the Jungle Brothers
We known throughout the jungle as the Jungle Brothers
The jungle, the jungle, the brothers, the brothers
We represent the jungle
We represent the brothers
Coming at you live
Like New York Undercover
Lightweight styles
Will only get smothered
It be like that where I come from, my brother
Streets filled with heat
These blocks are hot seat
Ghetto warriors with skills to compete
Lift you off your feet
Paint you with the feet
Give you something new every time that we meet
I'm on the front pages
My microphone gauges
(What?)
Blastin' in your faces
Straight up jungle funk
Is what we use to lace this
We jungle, we jungle, we brothers, we brothers
Brothers maintain, no joke with the focus
Pop up on your ass presto hocus pocus
Crush all that bogus, put your style unnoticed
Believe what you heard 'cuz you know that I want this
Flow over tracks like boats on water
Have ya walk the plank if ya get out of order
Gotcha, caughtcha sweeping up the street
Check out what I boughtcha, a batch of new beats
Excites your crowd at the Madison Square
Garden we keep ya head bobbin'
Make ya act retarded when ya see the JB's is on the set
You get more than what you bargained for
You're listening pleasure
So come out with that loot and buy my record at the store
The jungle, the brothers
The jungle, the jungle, the brothers, the brothers
The jungle, the jungle, the brothers, the brothers
The jungle, the jungle, the brothers, the brothers
The jungle, the jungle, the brothers, the brothers
The jungle, the jungle, the brothers, the brothers
The jungle, the jungle, the brothers, the brothers
The jungle, the jungle, the brothers, the brothers
The jungle, the jungle, the brothers, the brothers
The jungle, the jungle, the brothers, the brothers
The jungle, the jungle, the brothers, the brothers
The jungle, the jungle, the brothers, the brothers
We jungle, we jungle, we brothers, we brothers
