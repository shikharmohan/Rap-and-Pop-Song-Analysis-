Yeah, it's 50 A.K.A. Ferrari F-50
Break it down
I got a lot of living to do before I die
And I ain't got time to waste
Let's make it
You said you a gansta
But you neva pop nuttin'
You said you a wanksta
And you need to stop frontin'
You ain't a friend of mine, you ain't no kin of mine
What makes you think that I'm a run up on you with tha nine
We do this all tha time, right now we on tha grind
So hurry up and cop and go selling nicks and dimes
Shorty she so fine, I gotta make her mine
An ass like dat gotta be one of a kind
I crush 'em every time, punch 'em with every nine
I'm fuckin' with they mind, I make 'em press rewind
They know they can't shine if I'm around the rhyme
Been on parole since '94 'cuz I commit the crime
I send you my line, I did it three to nine
If D's ran up in my crib, you know who droppin' dimes
You said you a gangsta
But you neva pop nuttin'
You said you a wanksta
And you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership
But you neva cop nuttin'
You been hustlin' a long time
And you ain't got nuttin'
You said you a gangsta
But you neva pop nuttin'
You said you a wanksta
And you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership
But you neva cop nuttin'
You been hustlin' a long time
And you ain't got nuttin'
Damn homie, in highskew you was tha man, homie
What the fuck happened to you?
I got the sickest phonetta, when it come to the chedda
Nigga, if you play with my paper, you gotta meet my berretta
Now shorty think I'm a sweat her, sippin' on Amoretta
I'm livin' once then deada, I know I can do betta
She look good, but I know she after my chedda
She tryna get in my pockets, homie and I ain't gon' let her
Be easy, start some bullshit, she get your whole crew wet
We in tha club doin' the same ol' two step
Gorilla Unit 'cuz they say we bugged out
'Cuz we don't go nowhere without toast we thugged out
You said you a gangsta
But you neva pop nuttin'
You said you a wanksta
And you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership
But you neva cop nuttin'
You been hustlin' in a long time
And you ain't got nuttin'
You said you a gangsta
But you neva pop nuttin'
You said you a wanksta
And you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership
But you neva cop nuttin'
You been hustlin' a long time
And you ain't got nuttin'
Me I'm no mobsta, me I'm no gangsta
Me I'm no hitman, me I'm just me, me
Me I'm no wanksta, me I'm no acta
But it's me you see on your TV
'Cuz I hustle baby, this rap shit is so easy
I'm gettin' what you get for a brick to talk greasy
By any means, partner, I got to eat on these streets
If you play me close for sure I'm gonna pop my heat
Niggas sayin' they goin' murd' 50, how?
We ridin 'round with guns the size of Lil' Bow Wow
What you know about AK's and AR-15's?
Equipped with night vision, shell catchers and inf-beams, huh
You said you a gangsta
But you neva pop nuttin'
You said you a wanksta
And you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership
But you neva cop nuttin'
You been hustlin' a long time
And you ain't got nuttin'
You said you a gangsta
But you neva pop nuttin'
You said you a wanksta
And you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership
But you neva cop nuttin'
You been hustlin' a long time
And you ain't got nuttin'
Damn homie
