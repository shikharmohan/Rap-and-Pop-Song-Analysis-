{Yo Dre man, I take this bitch out to the movies
And shit man we're kissin' and grindin' and shit
So we hop in the back seat, you know man, this bitch
Rubbin' all over my dick and frontin' like she's gonna give me the pussy
Man, and the bitch said three words, man stop, no and don't I said "Bitch"}
You don't have to front on me dear
So why don't you just give that pussy here?
If you'd be good to me, oh I'll be good to you
And we'll both ride home in my automobile
All that I want is a little puss
All that I want is just a little head
If you'd be good to me, oh I'll be good to you
And we'll both ride home in my automobile
You don't have to front on me bitch
Don't be afraid it's only a dick
Give up the pussy soon all I want is a little
Or get your groopy ass out my hotel room
Or get your groopy ass out my hotel room
[Incomprehensible]
Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out
All I want is the pussy, all I want is the pussy
All I want is the pussy, all I want is the pussy
If you'd be good to me, oh I'll be good to you
And we'll both ride home in my automobile
We'll both ride home in my automobile
