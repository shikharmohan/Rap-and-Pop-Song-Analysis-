Give it to em!
Nuff respect!	and praise to the creator
Over the years it seems that I became a
Landmark, in the hip-hop field of art
I shed light, yet my skin is dark
I'm not conerned with climbin the chart
Cause why should you pay when it comes from the heart? 
I'll start, cause only jah will create it
I'll just name it, edutainment
People sit and they look at my album
Like a problem, they try to solve em
They don't know, it only leads the way
To a bright more positive day
By itself, it's not the bright day
Sit up straight, and hear what I say
Fear and ignorance, I'm down for stoppin this
But the bright day is your conciousness
I am poet, my words will heal you
I'm not a phony I'll really feel you
That's why I walk and talk to my nation
Wherever they are, in any situation
They usually ask for an autograph
And I'll whip out the pen and just write blast-
-master, k-r-s, o-n-e
Bdp, peace and unity
But do not concentrate on the paper
Concentrate on the laws of the creator
Cause when the paper's gone, it will deceive you
But allah will never leave you
Nothing I say now is hypothetical
These are the facts, a little metaphysical
We are one, every heart every lung
So why then was the black man hung? 
He was hung by the so-called christians
That went to church, and did not listen
See jesus couldn't stand politics
So they nailed him to a crucifix
Then it was that way, today it's a trigger
So why is the pope such a political figure? 
I don't know, but it's really beyond me
But through knowledge, they'll never con me
Cause from jesus christ to right now
Everytime a black man speaks up, ka-pow
See people concentrate on the leader
And not the message comin through the speaker
If the christians really heard christ
The black man never would've lived this life
My point is that do not concentrate
On what I state, create, or debate
I might be great, and you might admire
But what I say is to take you much higher
More higher than the physical plane
To the plane of forces in the astral plane
The mental plane, and the final three
They're all around you, yet you can't see
So grab the sphere of life and aim it
And you'll be guided by edutainment
