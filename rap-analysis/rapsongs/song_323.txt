Steel and fire
Spreading the holy word
Dirty liars
The truth has never been heard
Are you the own who think free
Or do you share this mad insanity
To use a religion - increasing the terror
Is much more that just a human error
What are they fighting for
They call it holy war
So many innocent have died
No democracy in the church of blood
There's no democracy
Welcome to the church of blood
Pray salvation
The promised paradise
Violent nations
Who kill and terrorize
Sowing the seeds of discord
Ready to kill in the name
Of our lord
Suicide victims setting their signs
Burning the books and the tales
What are they fighting for
They call it holy war
So many innocent have died
No democracy in the church of blood
There's no democracy
Welcome to the church of blood
Oh lord, my god - consider all the words thy hands
Have made
Your son - you sent him to die
I scare can take it in
That on the cross
My burden gladly bearing
He bled and died to save me
From my sin
