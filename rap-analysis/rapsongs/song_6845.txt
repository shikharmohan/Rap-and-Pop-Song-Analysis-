So, ninety-four's arrived nigga, back on up
And let me and my Dogg Kurupt fuck shit up
Now, can't nobody see me here or there
Wherever I bails, I put it down on the ground
'Cuz ain't shit for sale in the coupe with the beat flossin' off gold D's
And my cousin Snoop packs well, you know what I mean
And it don't take much, for the Dogg pound to bust a cap
In your ass, for gettin' us all fucked up

Slow your roll, like your legs was broken
Who's jokin'? Rakim never joked, so why should I loc?
Now that's my idol, check the vital rhyme flow doe
Runnin' 'em like Flo Jo, stranded on Death Row
Mediocre motherfuckers die 'cuz I'm servin' it

Smokin' indo, look out my window I suppose, yeah
Niggaz don't understand how we kicks diffrent flows

Beatin yo' ass down to the concrete
Fool, act like ya know
I'm stranded on Death Row with no where to go, so
What's a girl to do?
Take out a crew, or two, a few, what you wanna do?
Throw your guns in the motherfuckin' air, we don't care
