[Jennifer Hudson]
If anyones there can you hear my cry,
im falling way under, pull me out alive,
where the birds circle in the sky,
oh, pull me out alive,
[Ludacris]
I, just got laid off my job,
it couldnt happen at a badder time,
cos I got these unpaid bills
and Im thinking Imma lose my mind,
now I gotta cut back on spending,
and my girl wont shut her mouth,
she better work with the clothes that she got up in the closet
or I might lose this house,
aint nothing funny, its hard times,
and I donÃÂ¢€t wanna do nothing that will have me serving hard time,
but I got some mouths to feed,
and I m feeling mighty ignant,
cuz all of my credit cards and my bank accounts are insufficient
[Jennifer Hudson]
If anyones there can you hear my cry,
im falling way under, pull me out alive,
where the birds circle in the sky,
oh, pull me out alive,
can you hear me,
im falling way under,
pull me out alive,
where the birds circle in the sky,
oh, pull me out alive,
[Ludacris - Verse 2]
I need a bailout plan,
and I need it mighty fast,
tell bill collectors calling on my telephone,
n-gga kiss my mighty ass,
best friend just had a baby,
my pop just passed away,
so I drown my thoughts in a bottle,
and my dreams just cast away,
friends talkin bout hold it together,
they telling me take my time,
but they not in the same situation,
I canÃÂ¢€t afford to change my mind,
every night I pray to Jesus,
but I need a job too,
and if I donÃÂ¢€t find another soon,
then I might just have to rob you,
[Chorus]
ÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦.turn back, the cries turn back,
what do you do when you lost everything that you had,
and it feel like everyone is just standing there watching,
can you hear me cry,
can you hear me cry,
