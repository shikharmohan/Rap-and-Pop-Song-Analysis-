You had me, you lost me
And now you want me back
You fucked around and played around
And now your feeling sad
You had me, you lost me
And now you want me back
You fucked around and played around
And now your feeling sad
How should I start it off, you must have thought me soft
Like it was all good to move on and cross me off
We never shared secrets, we wasn't fucking raw
Helped you when you were down and now you got the fucking gawl
We used to be so tight, we was each others life
You was my husband and no doubt I was your fucking wife
Did anything you ever asked of Eve
You turned out to be a devil nigga I couldn't believe
Sneaking numbers out my phone calling bitches on the cell
What the hell! Clunky bitches one on the scale
I'm like a dime over line, you can't calculate my status
And you fucking with these bitches like my ass wasn't the fattest
Like I didn't dress the baddest any time we surface
Must have been insecure, niggas made you nervous
And I guess it was your purpose to lock me in
But you fucked up, your lucks out but then again
You had me, you lost me
And now you want me back
You fucked around and played around
And now your feeling sad
You had me, you lost me
And now you want me back
You fucked around and played around
And now your feeling sad
Used to let shit slide, caught a couple lies
I chilled for real, I mean I called the couple guys
Knew when you was fucking up, I saw it in your eyes
And I guess it was my fault 'cause I put up the disguise
In public we was happy, in home we'd be scrapping
Later we'd be naked, joking, smoking and laughing
Making up to break up, I thought that shit was love
But it wasn't and I learned the hard way soaking in suds
Crying all depressed, not again you'll never catch me
Wishing on a star for some nigga to come bless me
I tried to save it all you ever did was stress me
Pushing all me buttons why the fuck must you stress me
Nigga get a life, go on and find a wife
Get the fuck out my face for I go and find a knife
And you still calling my phone trying to act polite
Asking me for favors now you know that shit ain't right but
You had me, you lost me
And now you want me back
You fucked around and played around
And now your feeling sad
You had me, you lost me
And now you want me back
You fucked around and played around
And now your feeling sad
You see me coming don't you, look at you running won't you
Oh you gonna sit there and see me like I want to approach you
Now it's payback, I'm talking way back
To bitches calling hanging up, you ain't no way to save that
To unanswered questions, home in the a.m.
To you out clubbing, forcing me to stay in
Remember okay then it's over no playing
I said it before, I'm about to do it fuck what you saying
To late for apologies, go puff on a pile of weed
Think about this good bitch that's leaving and don't follow me
Moving on, shut you down, now you wanna regret
You could fuck all day but it would never feel like my sex
Played yourself tried to show I cared, you ain't cared
When I needed you the most nigga you wasn't there
And the game is the same comes around goes around
Now hate me forever while the chorus goes around
You had me, you lost me
And now you want me back
You fucked around and played around
And now your feeling sad
You had me, you lost me
And now you want me back
You fucked around and played around
And now your feeling sad
You had me, you lost me
And now you want me back
You fucked around and played around
And now your feeling sad
You had me, you lost me
And now you want me back
You fucked around and played around
And now your feeling sad
Look ma everybody makes mistakes alright
