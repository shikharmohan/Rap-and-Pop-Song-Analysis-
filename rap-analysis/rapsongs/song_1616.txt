look out the window
look at all that bullshit going on down there in the street
whats all that shit floating out in the water
yea we gotta get out of here we gotta go to some island
grab your shopping cart
grab your cane
lets get the heck out of here
we gotta move closer to the equator
when are they gonna start showing those list of tv runs
i used to love that guy
remember how he used to watch mr T. wrestling
coca cola doesnt taste the same as it used to
remember when a bowl of soup was a nickel
all that bass is gonna break my ears
