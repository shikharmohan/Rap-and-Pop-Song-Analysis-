C'mon
It's more 2 a song, jewelry and clothes
More to a nigga'z life than, money and hoes
The game is a lot bigger than you, think you know
And if you think you know then I don't think you know
Niggaz walk around frontin', talkin' 'bout jewels
How much you bust tools, y'all niggaz sounds like fools
Who you really think give a fuck how much your watch cost?
How much your watch cost? You 'bout to get your watch lost
If you flashin' it, you must not want it
See, I fuck with real niggaz that done it
You know what time it is, run it
Niggaz got more important shit to deal with
Talkin' about some 4 wheel shit
But my man here, is about to kill shit
Keep playin' niggaz pussy and you will get fucked
Why don't you cop some more ice dog
Then you will get stuck and fucked
Bitch-ass nigga, hit my street
And see what happens to that iceberg when it's hit by heat
It want be a pretty sight, you and your pretty wife
Oh, you must have forgot, dog, this is the shitty life
Ain't a fuckin' thing sweet and ain't nothing fair
Just another nigga dead, don't a motherfucker care
Dog, it's more 2 a song, jewelry and clothes
More to a nigga'z life than money and hoes
The game is a lot bigger than you think you know
And if you think you know then I don't think you know
Dog, it's more 2 a song, jewelry and clothes
More to a nigga'z life than money and hoes
The game is a lot bigger than you think you know
And if you think you know then I don't think you know
Born and raised in the projects and can't forget it
And all that grimy shit niggaz do, I done did it
And I'm still wit it, nigga, I stay in the hood
But when the cats is out, bet the dog, play in the hood
You keep bringin' them fake bitches through
You gon' fuck around and make bitches do
We take bitches too
An if you comin' through my block, it's gon' be the last stop
We blast tops, faggots couldn't make it to the stash box
Big ass rocks, I want that, fuck the blood
All that shit washes off, the next day I'm like, "What?"
Flossin' yo' shit, what I want for yo' shit?
Give a nigga like three bricks to feed the dogs with
'Cause I ain't really gots to shine when they do, I do
For me them niggaz'll hide you, where nobody'll find you
If you eatin' motherfucker then your dogs should be eatin' too
Not just four or five niggaz 'cause you know what the streets'll do
It's more 2 a song, jewelry and clothes
More to a nigga'z life than money and hoes
The game is a lot bigger than you think you know
And if you think you know then I don't think you know
Dog, it's more 2 a song, jewelry and clothes
More to a nigga'z life than money and hoes
The game is a lot bigger than you think you know
And if you think you know then I don't think you know
I will be the voice of the street til I die
'Cause I know if I keep my heart real, I'm gon' fly
Either let me fly or give me death
If you didn't catch it then get it now 'cause it's all that's left
And this will be the last breath provokin' my niggaz
To start choking y'all niggaz, and smokin y'all niggaz
A nigga would never have to say, "X, feed me"
You'll never hear a nigga say, "X is greedy"
Only, "X, believe me, I didn't know it was a setup"
Get up, cocksuckin' motherfucker, shut up
Shut up, [Incomprehensible] fuck you, nigga
From the hood to the wood, fuck you, nigga
This is for my dogs til death do us part
I'm still here 'cause I been here from the start
If I'm ever anywhere, anytime it gets ugly
The dog is aight 'cause I know the streets love me
It's more 2 a song, jewelry and clothes
More to a nigga'z life than money and hoes
The game is a lot bigger than you think you know
And if you think you know then I don't think you know
Dog, it's more 2 a song, jewelry and clothes
More to a nigga'z life than money and hoes
The game is a lot bigger than you think you know
And if you think you know then I don't think you know
Dog, jewelry and clothes
Money and hoes, think you know?
I don't think you know
