[Verse 1:]
Never have you seen in ya lifetime
A more divine southern rapper with a swag like mine
Facin all kinda time but smile like I'm fine
Brag with such passion and shine without tryin
Believe me, pains a small thing to a giant
I was born without a dime, out the gutter I climbed
Spoke my mind and didn't stutter one time
Ali said even the greatest gotta suffer sometime
So I huff and puff rhymes, lyrics so sick with it
Set the standard in Atlanta how to get get get it
So you up and coming rappers wanna diss, just kill it
I'm officially the realest, point blank, period
Whether I still live in the hood or just visit
Whatever you can do in the hood I done did it
That's why the dope boys and the misfits feel it
This still the city long as tip live it, listen
[Chorus:]
I ain't dead (nah) I ain't done(nah)
I ain't scared(of what), I ain't run(from who)
Still I stand (yeah)
No matter what VA here I am No matter what remember
I ain't break(never), I ain't fold(never)
They hate me more(so?)
Yeah I know, here I go
No matter what shortie, here I go
No matter what shortie
[Verse 2:]
You let the blog sites and the magazines tell it
I'm showed to be jail til 2027
Rather see me in the cell then
Instead of this new McLaruen
God will take you through hell, just to get you to heaven
So even tho it's heavy, the load I will carry
Grin and still bear it, win and still share it.
Apologies to the fans, I hope you can understand it
Like a change in direction, even when you ain't planned it
All you can do it handle it, worst thing you can do is panic
Use it to your advantage, avoid insanity manage
To conquer, every obstacle, make impossible possible
Even when winning illogical, losing is still far from optional
Yeah they wanna see you shot up in the hospital
But when life throws you punches, block and counter like a boxer do
Been locked inside this casa too long, I did a song
To make it known that the king lives on Pimpin
[Chorus:]
I ain't dead (nah) I ain't done(nah)
I ain't scared(of what), I ain't run(from who)
Still I stand (yeah)
No matter what VA here I am No matter what remember
I ain't break(never), I ain't fold(never)
They hate me more(so?)
Yeah I know, here I go
No matter what shortie, here I go
No matter what shortie
[Verse 3:]
Even in solitude, there's still no hotter dude
I show you how to do, what you do, you ain't gotta clue
All you do is follow dudes, sound like a lotta dudes
I'll weather whatever storm, make it out without a bruise
I understand why, now when my hands tied
They take shots cause if I'm out there it's a landslide
But revenge is best served as a cold dish
And suckas will get served better know this
Guess it was understood, for me it was over with
But I don't quit, if you ain't noticed yet
They couldn't wait to say goodnight shorty
So they can try to rhyme, act and look like shorty
Go get a beat from toomp, and make a hook like shorty
Before ya know it I'm back what it look like shorty
I lost my partner and my daughter in the same year
Somehow I rise above my problems and remain here
Yeah, and I hope the picture painted clear
If your hearts fill with faith then you can't fear
Wonder how I face years and I'm still chillin
Easy, let go and let God deal with it
[Chorus:]
I ain't dead (nah) I ain't done(nah)
I ain't scared(of what), I ain't run(from who)
Still I stand (yeah)
No matter what VA here I am No matter what remember
I ain't break(never), I ain't fold(never)
They hate me more(so?)
Yeah I know, here I go
No matter what shortie, here I go
No matter what shortie
