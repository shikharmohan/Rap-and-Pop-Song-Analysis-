When they tell you that you'll never get over 
Just tell 'em they're number one 
You're a champion 
So don't believe 'em when they try and say it's over 
Just tell 'em they're number one 
You're a champion 
(Busta Rhymes) 
Now 
There's nothing you can do to stop a nigga from within 
With the hunger of a lion I secure another win (HEY) 
So passionate 
You might even misinterpret it as arrogance, I'm going in (HEY) 
I'm a make the world feel my pain 
When I show you my muscle and I hustle through the game 
And even though they leave us in the hood like we aint SHIT 
We aint got nothing but everything to gain 
Even if a motherfucker try to pop me 
I'M SO BLESSED 
Do anything that you could do to stop me (STOP ME) 
Now I'm climbing up the ladder and I'm jumping at the top 
You might wanna call me ROCKY 
See there's more of us (UGLY) 
You don't really wanna war with us (TRUST ME) 
So glorious 
Coming from the battle, then we victorious
(Akon) 
I see it in your eye 
It aint hard to tell 
They're watching you 
(Can't nobody ever stop what I'm doing) 
They just telling you lies 
They want you to fail 
They're plotting on you 
(And they can never stop my movement) 
So... 
So don't believe 'em when they try to say it's over 
(You know exactly what to tell 'em) 
Just tell 'em they're number one (number one) 
You're a champion 
(T.I) 
See the websites lying, tryna block my shine 
Don't you know you never will stop my grind 
In a drop top flying, like I don't got time 
Got everybody surprised that I wont drop dimes 
What's on your mind? 
Best get me off it 
At least quit lying if you must keep talking 
Go on with the nonsense, best keep walking 
Boy how you sue us in the luggage that are hoping
A lot of ya'll gossip, I don't like that shawty
A couple months off I'll be right back shawty 
With a brand new swag and a brand new forty 
And a brand new ride, give a damn who saw it 
Nationwide move, nigga yeah you saw it 
Shawty need a bodyguard for a bodyguard don't it 
Tip on and off sound kinda hard don't it 
Ya'll hate to see me ball, take it up with god homie
