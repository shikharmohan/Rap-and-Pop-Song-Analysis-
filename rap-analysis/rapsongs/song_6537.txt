Up out of there
(Ain't nuttin' but a gangsta party)
Light that up G
Ahh shit, you done fucked up now
  (Ain't nuttin' but a gangsta party)
You done put two of America's most wanted
In the same motherfuckin' place at the same motherfuckin' time
  (Ain't nuttin' but a gangsta party)
Y'all niggaz about to feel this
Bring out the champagne glasses and the motherfuckin' condoms
  (Ain't nuttin' but a gangsta party)
Have one on us alright?
(Ain't nuttin' but a gangsta party)
Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Bomb the hoochies with precision my intention's to get richer
With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg my fuckin' homie
You is a cold ass nigga on them hogs
Sho' 'nuff, I keep my hand on my gun 'cuz they got me on the run
Now I'm back in the court room waitin' on the outcome
Free Tupac, is all that's on a niggaz mind
But at the same time it seem they tryin' to take mine
So I'ma get smart and get defensive and shit
And put together a million march for some gangsta shit
So now they got us laced
To multimillionaire motherfuckers catchin' cases
Bitches get ready for the throw down, the shit's about to go down
Uhh, me and Snoop about to clown
I'm losin' my religion, I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game but you got the rules missin'
Niggaz be actin' like they savage, they out to get the cabbage
I got nuthin' but love for my niggaz livin' lavish
I got a pet named P, she niggarino
I got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
And I think I got a black beamer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Seagel and do it all legal
And get scooped up by the little homie in the regal
It feel good to you baby bubba
Ya see this is for the G's and the keys motherfucker
Now follow as we ride
Motherfuck the rest two of the best from the West side
And I can make you famous, niggaz been dyin' for years
So how could they blame us
I live in fear of a felony
I never stop bailin' these, motherfuckin' G's
If ya got it better flaunt it, another warrant

Ain't nuttin' but a gangsta party
Now give me fifty feet defeat is not my destiny
Release me to the streets and keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, suffering is grief
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck wit me, I bust and flea
These niggaz must be crazy, what?
There ain't no mercy motherfuckers who can fade the thugs
Right you thought it was but it wasn't now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player
It's like 'cuz, blood, gang bangin'
Everybody in the party doin' dope slangin'
You got to have papers in this world
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
Ya doing ya job every day
And then you work so hard till ya hair turn gray
Let me tell you about life and bout the way it is
You see we live by the gun so we die by the gun's kids
They tell me not to roll with my glock so now I gotta throw away
Floatin' in the black Benz tryin' to do a show a day
They wonder how I live with five shots
Niggaz is hard to kill on my block
Schemes for currency and doe related
Affiliated with the hustlers so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm tryin' to get up on it
My nigga Dogg with me eternally the most wanted
