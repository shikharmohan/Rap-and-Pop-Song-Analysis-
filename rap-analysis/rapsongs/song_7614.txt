[Verse 1]
I relate to niggas and dey relate to me
Real niggas do real things thats how its supposed to be
Cut from the same cause, made da same shirt
Prolly had the same blood and got the same work
I'll wack ya a**
Skip to the N.O.
And lay low in the projects with my kinfolk
A-K 47 with the shoulder strap
set it off  have it soundin like the Nola Clap
Got 2 strikes nigga dodgin one time
This is real life you got the nerve to call it punch line
Well I got a punch line for ya
You aint talkin bout sh** i wanna see my lawyer
[Chorus]
Gangstas, Street Niggas, Real Gangstas, Street Niggas [2x]
[Verse 2]
F*** da style dey jockin my swang
Imma real street nigga we are not the same
Im grown nigga so play witcha own kids
Im old nigga so getcha old a** here
One white girl left save the last dance
My partner said he want it so dis ya last chance
Funny how a nextel will getcha 50 years
Co defindent makin deals like you work at sears
Still posted at the Amercoat
Judge givin cash  three numbers like at Amercoat
Play the game how it go F*** what a nigga thank
Cuz under pressure a nigga change like chamillion paint
[Chorus]
Gangstas, Street Niggas, Real Gangstas, Street Niggas [2x]
[Verse 3]
White sh** in my attic and i aint talkin sheep rock
Dey killed a nigga around the corner now the blocks hot
Blockbuster night glocks poppin like popcorn
Folks comin through shakin niggas like popcorn
Niggas soft like hot butter and dey might talk
Consession stand a** niggas love to drop salt
Imma street poet let me paint a picture
First of da month tryna get dis scrilla
Couple O's over here couple O's over there
Gotta whole one stash in my livin room chair
Dude never smile  aint sh** funny
G's in Maguire
Show me the money
[Chorus]
Gangstas, Street Niggas, Real Gangstas, Street Niggas [2x]
