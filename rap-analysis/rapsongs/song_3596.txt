Tell me right now, tell me whatÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ¯ wrong
Please tell me something before IÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ¦ gone
It seems like we have come to the end
Should I be listening to all my friends
     Is it true what they say?
     Is it true what they say?
     Is it true what they say?
     Is it true what they say?
IÃÂ¦Ã¢Â°ÃÂ¢ HEARING THINGS LIKE YOUÃÂ¦Ã¢Â°ÃÂ¡L BE SLEEPING CREEPING BEHIND MY BACK
YOU MIGHT BE LAUGHIN MIGHT BE JOKIN BUT IÃÂ¦Ã¢Â°ÃÂ¢ THINKIN ITÃÂ¦Ã¢Â°' WACK
IF WE ARE OVER LETÃÂ¦Ã¢Â°' BE OVER AND LETÃÂ¦Ã¢Â°' LEAVE IT AT THAT
SEE I CANÃÂ¦Ã¢Â°ÃÂµ TRUST YOU ANYMORE BECAUSE YOUR LOVE IS AN ACT
     Is it true what they say?
     Is it true what they say?
     Is it true what they say?
Just who do you, think I really am?
One of your mindless and stupid friends?
Why canÃÂ¦ÃÂ ÃÂ° you simply tell me the truth?
So I can hold you, or cut you loose?
IÃÂ¦Ã¢Â°ÃÂ¢ NOT THE TYPE TO LISTEN TO WHAT EVERYBODY WILL SAY
BUT MORE AND MORE ITÃÂ¦Ã¢Â°' SEEMIN THAT I CANÃÂ¦Ã¢Â°ÃÂµ TRUST YOU ANYWAY
YOU MAKE ME THINK THAT I MUST SLEEP WITH SOMETHIN OVER MY HEAD
FOR FEAR I WAKE UP IN A POOL OF BLOOD AND PROBABLY DEAD
HOW ARE WE LIVIN? HOW ARE WE LIVIN? IT SEEMS
YOU ARE NOT GIVIN WHAT YOU GAVE IN THE BEGINNING
HOW ARE WE LIVIN? HOW ARE WE LIVIN? IT SEEMS
YOU ARE NOT GIVIN WHAT YOU GAVE IN THE BEGINNING
     Is it true what they say?
     Is it true what they say?
     Is it true what they say?
IÃÂ¦Ã¢Â°ÃÂ¢ HEARING THINGS LIKE YOUÃÂ¦Ã¢Â°ÃÂ¡L BE SLEEPING CREEPING BEHIND MY BACK
YOU MIGHT BE LAUGHING MIGHT BE JOKING BUT IÃÂ¦Ã¢Â°ÃÂ¢ THINKING ITÃÂ¦Ã¢Â°' WACK
IF WE ARE OVER LETÃÂ¦Ã¢Â°' BE OVER AND LETÃÂ¦Ã¢Â°' LEAVE IT AT THAT
SEE I CANÃÂ¦Ã¢Â°ÃÂµ TRUST YOU ANYMORE BECAUSE YOUR LOVE IS AN ACT
IÃÂ¦Ã¢Â°ÃÂ¢ NOT THE TYPE TO LISTEN TO WHAT EVERYBODY WILL SAY
