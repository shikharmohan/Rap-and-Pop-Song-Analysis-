Gouda, sick wid it records
BME, Warner Brothers, the machinery
Ooh, look out pimp
Heavy on the grindin' entertainment
Stovetop productions
Ooh, hustlers are us
My game sharper than an elephant's tusk
Me, myself and I the only that I can trust
Sleep with one eye open finger on the pistol clutch
I got my hands and everything, I'm real instrumental
I'm as real as they come and don't need no bitch potential
When I was comin' up there certain things we don't allow
Like long fingernails and men arching they eyebrows
Here's another thing I don't condone and don't approve
How all of a sudden snitchin' became cool? I dunno
Gamed up I be chewin' on this mack granite
OG Jay be stomped that laced that niggas posted never can
I brought the baddest broad in the whole facilitation
All by way of mouthpiece just by my manipulation
I can make it look like I'm at my best when I'm at my worst
Persuade the broad to put on the dress and break her for her purse
Ten wraps and a rubber band
(Gouda)
Three or four more in my other hand
(Gouda)
Five, ten, fifteen, twenty
  (Gouda)
Twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five, forty
  (Chalupa)
Gettin' money, I'm a stunna, man
(Gouda)
In a Lac shootin' box like a hundred grand
(Gouda)
Forty-five, fifty-five, sixty-five, seventy-five
  (Gouda)
Eighty-five, ninety-five, wait, what am I doing?
  (Chalupa)
A day in the life on the soil in caliscrillya
Take the wrong turn and these youngstas out here kill ya
Well, I ain't concerned, they love us hustlas and dealers
They wanna tear our houses down so they can build some ikeas
Ooh, just tryna get my point across
Where I'm from it's pandemonium and chaos
Where I'm from the lights is off, we use matches
Where I'm from we do it bare-faced instead of ski masks
Ooh, no more talking on them cells
I heard the federal went ahead and bought Nextels, what?
Ooh, over crowded jails
They got us sleepin' in the gym instead of our own cells
Ooh, put our yeti together
Me and my investors, we flippin' ten or better
I got some Gouda, got a little bit of cheddar
My medallion got more colors than a peacock feather
Ten wraps and a rubber band
(Gouda)
Three or four more in my other hand
(Gouda)
Five, ten, fifteen, twenty
  (Gouda)
Twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five, forty
  (Chalupa)

  (Chalupa)
Gettin' money, I'm a stunna man
With bitch like I do little whips about the stunna van
My advice she a runner man
Off top, I'ma boss, shoe box full of rubber bands
Contraband on the other hand
Big girls, big quips, turn around, roll center man
On the real, I'm a gentleman
Put the scrilla, I'm a killa, man, hit it like a little man
What you doin' with that?
From the scratch, we can load up the Lac
A 1, we can bring that back from day 1, we get them wraps
Big stacks from the back of the shack
I buy the weed man
Hella turkey bags just to put my weed in
Oh, we gettin' Chalupa
Wrapped cheese in a rubber band and call it the Gouda
Ten wraps and a rubber band
(Gouda)
Three or four more in my other hand
