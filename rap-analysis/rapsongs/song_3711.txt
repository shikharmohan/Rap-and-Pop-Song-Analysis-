Yup, it's time for the teacher once more
Bo, bo, bo, bo, yeah, yeah, yeah

Bo, bo, bo, bo
You cats spit raps that are not believable
Your raps don't bubble 'cause they're inconceivable
Real life O.G.'s don't even speak to you
In hip-hop's culture there's really no need for you
I'll bring the heat to you, when it comes to them glocks
Like Freddie Foxxx, I'm keepin two
I'm known for my scary feuds
That's why I'm called The Terrorist by the Daily News
I rarely lose, I'm known to rattle a cage
I'm known to throw rappers off the stage
Maybe it's a matter of age
But as a MC I got no patience for some rappers these days
I'm not old skool, or new skool, I'm all skool
  (Yeah, I'll say it)
I'm not old skool, or new skool, I'm all skool
I'm not old skool or new skool, I'm all skool
Old skool or new skool, I'm all skool
I'm not old skool or new skool, I'm all skool
Old skool or new skool, I'm all skool
Yup, it's time for the teacher once more
If you bumpin' KRS, then you bumpin' the raw
I came through the door with Rakim
Old skool, new skool, we rocked both of them
'Eric B. for President', check out 'My Melody'
Marley Marl, he produced both of them
We supposed to win, guest lists, V.I.P.
Backstage passes when we rollin' in
This the all skool, we encompass it all
I teach MC and production is taught by Marley Marl
For all a y'all, just enjoy yourself
Makin' your own job, employ yourself
Don't destroy yourself and don't be fooled
I'm not old skool, or new skool, I'm all skool
Marley Marl, rock yo' spot
This that old skool overseen by Scott LaRock
I'm not old skool or new skool, I'm all skool
I'm not old skool or new skool, I'm all skool
I'm not old skool or new skool, I'm all skool
Old skool or new skool, I'm all skool
I'm not old skool or new skool, I'm all skool
Old skool or new skool, I'm all skool
Bo, bo, bo, bo, bo, get in this
