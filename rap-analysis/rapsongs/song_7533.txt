Lets get on this Rose
72 hours straight
do it like Alpo did it back in 88
step up in this bitch in an MCM suit
38 snub in my MCM boots
Young what you smoking on
I call it 6 c-notes
got it on the westside, cost me 6 c-notes
nigga sold it to me so hot call him heatstroke
poured all the powder on the table make a ski slope
you looking at me young rich porter and some raybans
bitch I'm finna blow the money trial, this my rain dance
I'ma have my name ringing so loud it wake the feds up
tell the DA we on our way, make the beds up
I ain't trippin on shit man I sleep when I get down
young your going out tomorrow night, I'm like shit yeah
every night the club be open bitch we in there
tell em all the bottles on me, I broke brick for it
[Chorus:]
I'ma sleep when I die
sleep, sleep when I die
sleep when I die
sleep, sleep when I die
I got vodka in my left, champagne in my right
but I do it real big, this could be my last night
I'ma sleep when I die
sleep, sleep when I die
sleep when I die
sleep, sleep when I die
I'm gon tell y'all something right now I'm too high
my name is Snowman bitch I'ma sleep when I die
We count money all day, why you think my hands hurt
know I can't serve a nigga that, that my man's work
you aint a four wall on hold thats a kitkat
another nigga want a heinekin that's a six pack
cocaine cowboys business now horses
and every now you might catch us in some Porsche's
and sellin that soft shit as white as air forces
and got that rap button nigga aint she gorgeous
fall up in the spot, poppin bottles like [?]
PJ [?] bitch don't bring me no Cristal
Veuve Clicquot Champagne like we won the World Cup
pull up in that champagne thing, fuck the World up
what type of hood nigga wearing yellow gold rolex
the weight man bitch the whole hood call me Bo flex
either the yellow hand Lamb or the starburst 'rari
I'm doing too much for you niggas I'm sorry
[Chorus]
[Bridge:]
Just roll the ball til them folks come get ya
but you gotta spend it all cuz you can't take it with ya
just roll the ball til them folks come get ya
yeah I see them boys watching, tell them niggas take a picture
just roll the ball til them folks come get ya
but you gotta do it big
so when you gone the streets miss ya
just roll the ball til them folks come get ya
I aint never gon sleep cuz I'm trying to get richer
[Chorus]
