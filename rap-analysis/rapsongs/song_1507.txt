In america today
People think they know the way
Of the soul
De la is on the road
To blink and clear the hay
Behind the line of inner fine
We 've explained this time and time
Daisies don't mean everything
Daisies don't mean anything
But the word itself when broken up
Wears just a larger pound
D.a. stands for "t-h-e"
I is "inner"
S is "sound"
Y is "y'all", that's you
Should see the inner sound
Will help you breathe
But still I sport a heavy sigh
When I have to explain
It's just me, myself and i
It's just me, myself and i
It's just me, myself and i
It's just me, myself and i
Paul: so, you're just yourself, huh, pos? 
Pos: basically paul, that's it.
Paul: you mean you're not a hippie? 
Pos: no.
Paul: not even a half a hippie? 
Pos: not a nugget.
Paul: wait. what about you and dove's parents? 
Pos: straight up soul brothers and sisters.
Paul: so what the full equation shows is "the inner sound y'all"
Should be focused on, not just the word 'daisy' itself.
Pos: most definitely.
Paul: wait a minute. did you say 'most definitely? '
Pos and paul: rrrr-rah
