(Intro)
Many mothafuckas criticize pros and how they play
And many mothafuckas criticize rappers and what they say
Even though they criticize
Secretly they fantasize
But they know they'll never be paid to play
Yeah
Ima kill one of you young punks
With a old school flow (flo flo flo)
Though I walk through the shadow of death
I got to make sure that my shoes and my outfit fresh
You bitches get jealous when you see me comin'
Y'all would too if you seen my woman
Now y'all know me I'm bout to do what we do
This shit right here's bout as sick as the flu
Drunk mothafuckas wanna vomit on my shoe
Niggas can't have shit, prolly cause of you
Rappers go to jail like Oprah go to Yale
Stand my policy, don't ask don't tell
Wear my waterbees as I go get the mail
Half black is the new black can't you tell
It was blue black like Wesley Snipes in New Jack
Now you go to have a white momma just to do that
Tiger Woods, he used to be a safe nigga
Go ahead and let your daughter have a date with 'em
He gon' make with her prolly in a wife beater
Tiger  'bout to change his name to "Cheater"
I don't like it when you call me Big Poppa
From South Central and I hate helicopters
If we at school I'll break in your locka
See me with a water bottle it's prolly vodka
Drink responsibly or drink constantly
Be who you wanna be in this economy
Drunk as Sean Connery at the finery
Can't throw me out mothafucka I'm the honery
Trust me I'll never be the nominee
I don't kiss enough ass, I'm too honery
Ice Cube, be what a piranha be
Swimmin' upstream eatin' all kinda meat
Westcoast treat it like hyenas
Take what you want from these lying ass cheaters
Eat the fuck out these fake ass beavers
Thats how we act when you don't wanna feed us
Crazy mothafucka ever since I was a fetus
Might as well join us, you ain't gon' beat us
Please believe us, you can ask Jesus
I'ma be here bout as long as Regis
Understand I never pledge of allegiance
In this balla confusion might cause a contusion, boy
I see you cruising for a bruising
Fuckin with a principal that don't like students
Don't you know detention is a lynchin'
And I fail to mention I'm spinnin' up my pension
The reason I home in
Cause this right here ain't no country for young men
Sunny You done fucked up the churches money
I'm Red Foxx and you dat Big Dummy
This junkyard was a empire
Y'all let it get overran by the vampires
Most MCs is goddam lies
Like them fuckin supervisors workin' up at Kaiser(?)
Bitch I'm not a Dodger Im a Laker punk
Yous a fuckin Clipper you can call me Jack the Ripper
Cut you up by you guiser then down by your liver
Rooter to the Tooter gut you like Flipper
Dipper Y'all better treat me like the Skipper
Head trigger for every nigga
Every hunkie and every critter
I come through and kill every litter
(Like that) Uhh, no country for young men
No No No
It's just a balla confusion
No country for young men
No No No
Your world is just an illusion
No country for young men
No No No
It's a balla confusion
No country for young men
No No No
Your world is just an illusion
