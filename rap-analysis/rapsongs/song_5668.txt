Hey, top priority
Peace before everything
God before anything
Love before anything
Real before everything
Home before anyplace
Shoot before anything
Style and state radiate
Love power slay the hate
Truth killer, flakey face
Players say it to they face
Ain't afraid to major straight
Race at the table straight
Flow greatest like the greatest lakes
Capes all greatest states
Quiet water major waves
Steer the course make a way
And come ashore on a greater day
Home grown from the greatest grain
Full flavor in the native strain
Now put that on your brainy brain
Full exposure to favorite slang
Minimal wage and major gangs
Y'all seen them play the bait
Later night from day to day they came to play
We came to stay get out the way
Biotch sons buy heat rocks
Brooklyn finest, preservation to beat box
[Incomprehensible] detox
When we rock the people [Incomprehensible] priority
Peace before anything
God before everything
Love before anything
Real before everything
Home before anyplace
Shoot before anything
Style and state radiate
Love power slay the hate, priority
Love power
