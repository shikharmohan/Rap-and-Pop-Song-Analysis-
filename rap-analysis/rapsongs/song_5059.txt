[Lupe Singing]
Today, nobody cares
But tomorrow, they will 
Today, nobody cares
But ohhh tomorrow, they will 
[Chorus]
They said my future was dark, see me now
Just look around...I'm Beamin 
They used to talk, when I wasn't around 
You see me now I'm Beamin 
[Verse 1]
I get my energy, from my inner G
I be in outer space, but I got inner peace
So tell my enemies, that they can't injure me
I know that irritates, you have my sympathies
Well you should protest, yea you should picket me
I on a losin strike, Im on a winnin streak
Im out at left field, Im speakin mentally
But thats a better place, then where the benches be
Im feelin really good, me and different beat
Me and my different drummer, he played the timpanis
See thats what got me here, you hearin me
Me on my "Black man in the future shit," call me Billy Dee
See Im just forward lookin, thats how I really see
See while you valentines, I'm thinkin christmas trees
And thats happens to be, even at Micky D's
Semi-colon, close parentheses
[Chorus]
They said my future was dark, see me now
Just look around...I'm Beamin (Beamin)
They used to talk, when I wasn't around
You see me now...I'm Beamin
[Verse 2]
Do you remember me, the guy from verse 1
Failures my last name, nevers my first one
You see I hood a lot, and yea I nerd some
Hoods where the heart is, nerds where the words from
Dont represent either, because I merged them
S kids who wanna leave, and I encourage them
Go out and see the world, never return from
Yea you don't come back, unless you learn some
And baby girl what does it matter where your purse from
Your hurr done, your nails did, your ass fat but you're dumb
Mix Melyssa Ford, with Maya Angelou
Become a Top Model, and Sojourner too
 I try to follow this, what Muhammed do
Its such an old soul, inside this sonic youth
Swear I'm ferrarid up and I'm conscience too
I don't prophesize, I promise you
[Chorus]
They said my future was dark, see me now
Just look around...I'm Beamin 
They used to talk, when I wasn't around 
You see me now...I'm Beamin
[Verse 3]
Yea its me again, the guy from verse 2
But its the last one, its almost curfew
Its almost night out, so turn ya lights on
Where all my 760's, with ya brights on
Yea they are the ones, to keep your eyes on
Like how we used to do, to keep the house warm
Now those the type of eyes, I not cry from
You see the tears of fire run out my cryin songs
Now the world shoulders, is what we cryin on
The worlds fast lane, is what I'm drivin on
What am I drivin at, tryin to drive at home
I'm in the drivers seat, but you can ride along
Its never cyclops, its never I alone
I'm tellin your story, wherever I perform
Now if they lookin for me, tell me Ive gone
Out in the bright lights, right where I belong
[Chorus]
They said my future was dark, see me now
Just look around...I'm Beamin 
They used to talk, when I wasn't around
You see me now...I'm Beamin
