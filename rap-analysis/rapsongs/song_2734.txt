(scarface & willie d)
I got a partner who been gone but we [? ? ]
And I ain't seen him since he's been gone imagine that
A young nigga in the hood I grew up in
Fightin a battle in the system that no one wins
And all these niggas go for bad when they lose friends
Gettin impossible to top all the loosed ends
My homeboy lost his sista in a carry
He's still alive but through her eyes he done saw her death
And when he came he was violent
And when he left she was silent (silent)
No other way left to describin
You tellin niggas keep they heads up you fool you
When they killin niggas like they used to
And ain't no muthafuckin body fightin back
Pretty soon they gon be hangin blacks (why? )
Cause niggas won't react we're takin eye 4 an eye
And a tomb for tomb do them bitches like they do us
Cockin back and shoot
(chorus #1)
Lockin low standin at the end of the road
Glocks explode you muthafuckas reap what you sow
Lock the doors ain't nobody leavin alive
At the end of the line we gotta die
(chorus2)
That's why we're takin eye 4 an eye
And a tomb for tomb
Do them bitches like they do us
Cockin back and shoot
Lockin low standin at the end of the road
Rob and blew
You ride 4 me I ride 4 you
(verse 2)
And when you pop them muthafuckas
You pop them bitches till they stop bleed
I'm coming through and my glock leaps
And they stop breathin
You tell his muthafuckin mama:'stop grievin'
Cause we're not leavin
Until she know how to feels to lose a loved one
Muthafuck' a redneck race
(fuck that nigga let's slug one nigga)
Tied the bitch by his ankles to the back of a truck
Rag his ass till his body parts whip to fuck up
(chorus #1)
(verse 3)
That's why I'm keepin my peace of mind
Poverty destruction to be destroy
Everything that they'd touches
Leavin niggas on crunches
And the whole neighborhood in pain
We bow our heads and continue to pray
(chorus #1 + #2)
(verse 4)
You disrespect our community when you come around
[? ? ] of black ministers to calm us down
Bitch fuck peace and the police
Until the bullshit cease it's a war in the belly of the beast
A neck-turner-learner
I keep my finger on the fuckin trigga
I ain't scared like these other niggas
Black life bein lost to you cannibal types
While you're fightin over animal rights
You cannibal wives
And cavitate 'em like they did do
And let em wroughtin the woods
Leave em sittin over burnt food
It's cold blooded
Cause we can't get a fair shot
We did in 20 years for dime rocks
Three strikes and shit for niggas and the rod doles
Not for the crack it's all for [? ? ] and I hope (I hope)
But painfully we're all overcomin
But ain't no muthafuckin singin
You want drama we can bring it
(willie d)
Look i'ma say this shit one time and one time only
We ain't against all white people
But we are against all white people that's against us
Fuck all you muthafuckas!!
(verse 5 & chorus #1 + #2)
Fuck the jail cells
Fuck the [? maniac ass dogs? ]
Fuck the chewing tobacco
Fuck the confederate flag
And fuck your militias
Your shotguns in the back of your pickups!
You cow-herdin, sheep-fuckin, horseback-ridin
Berefoot-walkin, tractor-drivin, trailer-parkin
Cousin-fuckin, nigga-jew-hatin
Redneck racist (you muthafucka!!)
You muthafuckas are unbelievable
Y'all talkin all that shit about go back to africa
You were'nt talkin all that shit when we was out there in them fields sweatin
Pickin that cotton for y'all muthafuckin asses
Re-feel this muthafucka
We deserve just as much if not more
Prosperity then you hoes do
Angry white men
Who the fuck you angry with
You should be angry with your muthafuckin self
Because we don't own corporate america
Y'all do
Corporated america is 70 % white male anglo saxon
Y'all run the muthafuckin
Y'all took the job lower these
You wanna be bad at somebody
Be mad at your goddamned self
But if you wanna get it on we can get it on muthafucka
Till the break of dawn you understand what I'm sayin
You wanna race war
We got it
I ain't scared to you muthafuckas
