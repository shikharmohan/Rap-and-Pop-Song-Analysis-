Let's knock it out that's all, oh we gon' do it
Now get the fuck out put it down
But it gotta bang
It has to bang ya know?
I'ma bang, hit the block pitchin' slang
Bang, hit the rock spit the game
Bang, get the glock spit the flame
Do my motherfuckin' thing
I'ma bang, hit the block pitchin' slang
Bang, hit the rock spit the game
Bang, get the glock spit the flame
Do my motherfuckin' thing
I speak for the meek and the lonely, weak and the hungry
Speak for the part of the street that keep it ugly
And niggaz couldn't wear my shoes
'Cause the places that I walk, most catz couldn't bear my dues
Or pay the tolls of the roads I done kept on, crept on
Walk 'til I got tired then curled up and slept on
My journey has earned me the right to reach
I burned so I earned the right to teach, what to eat
What niggaz been gettin' fed is pork
What you niggaz been gettin' fed, shouldn't be even on your fork
Let's talk, about this, and about that
Yeah, we like this or we can do it out back
Keep the bullshit for the rodeo
'Cause on the real, you cocksuckers don't know me yo
Hit you wit' something for frontin' that'll end your life
Then hit your crib and bend your wife
I'ma bang, hit the block pitchin' slang
Bang, hit the rock spit the game
Bang, get the glock spit the flame
Do my motherfuckin' thing
I'ma bang, hit the block pitchin' slang
Bang, hit the rock spit the game
Bang, get the glock spit the flame
Do my motherfuckin' thing
It upsets me to see niggaz that's flossin' too much
Wearin' shit that's costin' too much, how often I touch
I like to break fake niggaz, rape snake niggaz
I take weight nigga, you fake hate nigga
And niggaz and ain't got the balls to say to my face
What you think behind my back suck my dick, how's about that?
Loose lifts is loose clips and crews hit
I run with niggaz from Israel to hijack crew ships
Watch the news at 6, that's how I'm gettin' down
Feds lookin' for the dog, oh that nigga outta town
This is a grown-up game, thinkin' 'cause you got a blown-up name
You won't get a blown-up frame
I ain't playin' wit' you niggaz no more, them are old
I be layin' when you hit the door, you hit it cold
Be like oh no, see what I'm sayin'
I told Money to stop playin', now he layin', we prayin'
I'ma bang, hit the block pitchin' slang
Bang, hit the rock spit the game
Bang, get the glock spit the flame
Do my motherfuckin' thing
I'ma bang, hit the block pitchin' slang
Bang, hit the rock spit the game
Bang, get the glock spit the flame
Do my motherfuckin' thing
Oh my God yeah niggaz done lost yo mind
Toss the nine, this nigga done cross the line
Disrespectful shit will get you hit, bitch
Fuck who you with, you niggaz get what you get
Five to the spine, ride now niggaz is dyin'
Money pulled out he was trying, yet to slow wit the iron
Nuttin' but gun firing, blap blap blap blap
Cocksucka where it at
Open up your back now I can see through your stomach
Told stupid muthafucka to stop runnin', or run in
To a buck shot, can't duck off shot
It's that click click boom you outta luck shot
Now don't fall to pieces on me, because the piece is on me
He thought the leash was on me, but dog the streets are hungry
And I'ma feed 'em every time I sing, do my thing
Dog gon' bang, bang, bang
I'ma bang, hit the block pitchin' slang
Bang, hit the rock spit the game
Bang, get the glock spit the flame
Do my motherfuckin' thing
I'ma bang, hit the block pitchin' slang
Bang, hit the rock spit the game
Bang, get the glock spit the flame
Do my motherfuckin' thing
I'ma bang, hit the block pitchin' slang
Bang, hit the rock spit the game
Bang, get the glock spit the flame
Do my motherfuckin' thing
I'ma bang, hit the block pitchin' slang
Bang, hit the rock spit the game
Bang, get the glock spit the flame
Do my motherfuckin' thing
