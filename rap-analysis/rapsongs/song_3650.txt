But am I over ya head?
Am I over ya head?
But am I over ya head?
Yo am I over ya head?
But am I over ya head?
Am I over ya head?
Well am I over ya head?
Yo am I over ya head?
Huh? What? Where? Who?
What? What ya thinkin' about?
When who says what when how
You can't maybe follow my style
You be the child, I be the teacher
Smile, who said when, what mouth not shut, what?
Whenever, however, whenever, whatever the cut
How you maybe could you ever believe?
That you could so quickly achieve these crafts
Please laugh at his stupid ass upon your knees in glass
You lust, for everything but trust, so we bust back
With consciously charged art with a mic instead of a brush
But am I over ya head?
Am I over ya head?
But am I over ya head?
Yo am I over ya head?
Am I over ya head?
Yo am I over your head?
Yo am I over ya head?
Listen
Yes, us must trust us, who? Us must trust not fuss with us
Us must trust us discuss trusting us
Us must trust us, who? Us must trust not fuss with us
Us must trust us discuss thus trusting us
Trusting us, us must trust discuss
Discuss not trusting us must not fuss
Us with us means us discussing trusting us
Us must trust us, who? Us must trust not fuss with us
Us must discuss trusting us
But am I over ya head?
Yo am I over your head?
But am I over ya head?
