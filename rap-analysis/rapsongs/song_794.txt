See when we get on shit
We like to make you shake your ass
Move your hips
So we gonna do a little something like this
Flipmode, Bad Boy
Check this out
Tell me how it feels, is it hot, is it not?
Does it drop, cash like a slot?
Does it stay streeted go pop?
Checkin' out what Flipmode got, mad hip-hop
Chartin' number one, drinks in the sun
Eighty times so we can get sponged, shake it hon'
All a brother know is make the hit get the dough
Makin' grandmas hit the floor, really though
It's my thang, my slang
Rich motherfuckers [Incomprehensible] chicks at the [Incomprehensible]
Bringin' my team to the joint
Wit Alan Iversan runnin' on point
Don't smoke a spliff on the joint
And when you see me they on point
Cause I, I be that nigga wit the million dollar figures
Gettin' all up in they bitches leavin' they pussy in stitches, uh
Aiyyo, I'm on to the next level
I'm gettin' rich, friends said I switch
I got me a bad chick, live up in the hills
Pay my mom's bills, recoup a half a mil
Still got my deal, pop the 700 Benz-o
You never seen, cash money fiend
A lot of cats wanna dream
Pack a shorty black or Phillipian
The way I eat my shrimp with steam
I'm the man with the gangsta lean, what, what
Yo, I split your whole spleen if you know what I mean
Call me little rabcash, I get you for your stash
VIP pass, save all the gas, I make it last
To my people in the front if you ready to bump say
"Don't stop the body rock"
To my people in the back if your not a wack say
"Don't stop the body rock"
To my people in the left if your hot to death say
"Don't stop the body rock"
To my people in the right wanna party tonight just say
""Don't stop the body rock
Since Mase refuse to lose, we makes numeral moves
'Cause I'm smoother than them dudes
And them two thousand dollar shoes
When I move to new Jerus, 'cause I like the cruise
And my six double O, blast weed, love the dough
I'm that Goodfella, what the hella they can tell me?
Smoke my la la out in LA, who's ready
Juice heavy, back 'n' blue Chevy
See angealan they winnin', a nigga need the chedda
'Cause I'm more in a broad way with all A's and platinum
There been many things we touch
Never had in finance so I never had to deduct shit 1.8
And every week I have to re-up, so what, so what
Aiyyo check out the way me and my niggas always be whippin' shit
The way that I display no flavor and do it so intricate
Pidda and padda, padda and pidda over with the shit
U, u, u, u, oh, y'all niggaz be yappin to make me sick of it
Hit you wit shit that y'all niggaz never ever forget
Fuckin' wit my niggaz just like you playin' Russian roulette
Ooh, me and my whole platoon coming soon
Nigga make room, we diesel like a bunch of baboons
Hey there, yo, think you can manage all of my niggaz damage
Tryin' to alter our lavage liven niggaz turn savage, yo
Flipmode and Bad Boy collabo
Makin' sure all of you niggaz all stay home
To my people in the front if you ready to bump say
"Don't stop the body rock"
To my people in the back if your not a wack say
"Don't stop the body rock"
To my people in the left if you hot to death say
"Don't stop the body rock"
To my people in the right wanna party tonight just say
"Don't stop the body rock"
