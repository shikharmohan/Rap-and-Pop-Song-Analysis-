I'm not in love, so don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made
I'm not in love, no, no, no, it's because
I like to see you but then again
That doesn't mean you mean that much to me
So if I call you, don't make a fuss
Don't go and tell your friends about the two of us
I'm not in love, oh, no, no, it's because
Woah, you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh, he'll wait a long time, yeah
I keep your picture right there on the wall
It hides a nasty stain that's been lying there, yeah, yeah
So don't you ask me, no, to give it back
I know you know it don't mean one thing to me
I'm ain't in love, no, no, no, no, it's because
Woah, you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh, he'll wait a long time for me, yeah
I'm not in love, no, I'm not in love, yeah, no, no, no, no
I ain't in love, no, no, no, no, it's because
Woah, you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh, he'll wait a long time for me
(Keep waiting, keep waiting, waiting, waiting)
I ain't in love, I ain't in love, no, no, no
  (Keep waiting, keep waiting, waiting, waiting)
(Keep waiting, keep waiting, waiting, waiting)
I ain't in love, I ain't in love, I ain't in love, I ain't in love
  (Keep waiting, keep waiting, waiting, waiting)
(Keep waiting, keep waiting, waiting, waiting)
I ain't thinkin' about you, baby
(Keep waiting, keep waiting, waiting, waiting)
I don't miss you like crazy
(Keep waiting, keep waiting, waiting, waiting)
I ain't in love, I ain't in love, I ain't in love, no
  (Keep waiting, keep waiting, waiting, waiting)
Keep waiting, keep waiting
