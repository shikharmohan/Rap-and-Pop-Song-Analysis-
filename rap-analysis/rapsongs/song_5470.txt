Nigga, waz up?
You think you tough, I'm fly shit
Has a bitch, dope as fuck
Sho nuff I'm guaranteed, no diggities
Fight you like the fucking enemies
You would think there's fucking ten of me
When I'm sending these
Blows, blows, hoes want to roll like hydro
When I suck Timbaland's bone like you
Fido, I go
Scoop Lil' Kim
Me, she, her, them and him
Gets high in a tunnel
They see my Lexus comin'
They hear the bass rumblin'
They come quick, they come quick
Like a dick, I make myself sick
I'm so motherfuckin' bad to the bone
Like my titties are full blown
My style of rappin'
I'm such, such, such a good rapper
I give you good and plenty
My styles the bomb diggy
My style of rappin'
I'm such, such, such a good rapper
I give you good and plenty
My styles the bomb diggy
I'm calling your cards like Sprint
Can't be me, can't see me
I'm low like Timb, ladies and gents
Dogs, cats and babies
Whoever but my style
I hope you croak from the rabies
Swayze, maybe I call your name
Ain't that a fucking shame
I'm too high for that
I'm great like the Dane
Mane on main
If you decide to put your hands
On my fucking light
Like the cigarettes I light
You must burn, you better learn
From the pro
Who rock shows after shows
When it rains it pours
I hurt like the cold souls
My style polishes like nails and toes
You know, know
My style of rappin'
I'm such, such, such a good rapper
I give you good and plenty
My styles the bomb diggy
My style of rappin'
I'm such, such, such a good rapper
I give you good and plenty
My style the bomb diggy
You beg to be put on like cats
Nigga know who I am
Now you want to sing and dance
You want to shake your stanky ass
Well I'm sorry Sam
God damn, you ain't family
You hounding me, pounding me
With the same old story
You bore me
Lordy have mercy on all these groupies
Sorry cutie
Why you go and shake your bootie?
'Cause there's only one Lil' Kim
The triple beam, the misdemean
Nigga queen, whoomp, we Tag Team
So hot we melt like ice cream
Without the dick riding
Dreams of smoking a California blunt
I got the lyrics to make you feel it
What you want nigga?
I'm talking about my style
I am the flyest then RZA now
I'm talking about my style
Let me tell you about Missy's style
My style of rappin'
I'm such, such, such a good rapper
I give you good and plenty
My styles the bomb diggy
My style of rappin'
I'm such, such, such a good rapper
I give you good and plenty
My style the bomb diggy
