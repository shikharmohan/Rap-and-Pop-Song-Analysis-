Ah, the sun is shining brighter 'cause you really make my day
Yeah, you really make my day, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, I think I like her 'cause she really makes my day
Yeah, she really makes my day, oh, oh, oh
See her on the beach, she was wrapped in a towel
Her body's so endowed seen her ass crack the smile
Enjoying the Nile, take it the breeze or some cat and mouse
And she was the cheese and the sun eased in our conversation
California dreamin' now Californiacation
Said she had drinks in the cooler and I had an invitation
If I wanted I could brewer, this is just an indication
On how cool she was, a couple of chicks came with the groupie love
They ain't want no pictures, only to be hugged
I'm thinkin' damn, damn that's really cool because
Sometimes I wanna chill
Sometimes the best things in life are not even planned
We came to the sand and got more than a tan
Baby girl, I'm a man and we can do this my way
Take a ride on the highway and pretend like it's Friday and it is
Ah, the sun is shining brighter 'cause you really make my day
Yeah, you really make my day, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, I think I like her 'cause she really makes my day
Yeah, she really makes my day, oh, oh, oh
She was at a barbecue
Pretty painted nails, she took off her shoes
She was show and tell like it was a grammar school
Sippin' on some L, I thinking man she cool
Sun smiling on her hair
Hey, they playing spades and we can be a pair
She had a spray on her, I can see it from my chair
I love it when it's sunny girl, you could be my Cher
It's independence day and freedom's in the air
We dance and danced away yo
Show them how to step, it's like a tango
My whole body angle, I can tell she'd like me
She got me a [Incomprehensible] you're sweet as icy
Spice it on, your sauce drip from my lips
Just stick to last step, we can do something hip
Take a trip around the world in a day
Play Fiona A like your worries blow away like it's all okay and it is
Ah, the sun is shining brighter 'cause you really make my day
Yeah, you really make my day, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, I think I like her 'cause she really makes my day
Yeah, she really makes my day, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah, the sun is shining brighter 'cause you really make my day
Yeah, you really make my day, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, I think I like her 'cause she really makes my day
Yeah, she really makes my day, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
