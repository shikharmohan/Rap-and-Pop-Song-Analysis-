Nigga, my gun go off
You see the barrell turnin', you feel the hollows burnin'
Nigga, now you learnin', nigga, my gun go off
Call it attempted murder, nigga, I'm tryin' to merk you
When I come back bustin', nigga, my gun go off
Don't try to say I'm trippin' when I get to flippin'
An' I start to clip in, nigga, my gun go off
We call it puttin' work in, leavin' niggas hurtin'
Homicide's learkin', nigga, my gun go off
Fuck, boy, you can see it to believe it
Tryna dodge and wave it, end up a paraplegic
Believe me it's easy, I'll hurt you, I'll merk you
I'll pop summin', drop summin', I ain't gonna stop huntin'
Run, run till you're spun, one shot, one gun
One, 911 emergency, it's murder, B
It's excellent execution when I'm pulling the trigger
No mistake for that cake, I'm hittin' you and your niggas
Feel the flame when I aim for the top of your brain
See the spark and the bang, nigga shit ain't a game
Do the math when you blast, bullets go through the glass
Go through your ass fast and the leather seat sittin' Ave
Nigga, it's not a war when there's casualties on one side, I ride
Turn it up on you niggas after Jay ride by
I click-clack, that's that, I don't flash, I mash
I wave the Uzi at 'em, I make a movie out 'em
Nigga, my gun go off
You see the barrell turnin', you feel the hollows burnin'
Nigga, now you learnin', nigga, my gun go off
Call it attempted murder, nigga, I'm tryin' to merk you
When I come back bustin', nigga, my gun go off
Don't try to say I'm trippin' when I get to flippin'
An' I start to clip in, nigga, my gun go off
We call it puttin' work in, leavin' niggas hurtin'
Homicide's learkin', nigga, my gun go off
Yeah, you better lose yourself in the moment
Use it, fuck the music, I'ma let it go
You only get one shot 'fore I back out and fire back
At ya hat, at ya back, ya ass crack, ya nut sack
Your Cadillac, if you make it to that, I'm hitting that
The 70's was smack, 80's crack, 90's was grimey
Millennium mac's man, clips on the whips
I ride in 'em and bad bitches I ride in 'em
And don't worry I'll get 'em, gat jammed or unjammed
Goddamn, safest the safety, don't work
Squeeze the eagle, it chirp
End up faced down in the dirt, more than hurt
Bring the beef where you hang out
Bang out, shots ring out
Hit your shoulders, tryin' to blow your brains out
Hit your homies in their legs
Bet they have their canes out tomorrow
You know tomorrow's just a day away
If you can keep your heart beatin' and your ass awake
Nigga, my gun go off
You see the barrell turnin', you feel the hollows burnin'
Nigga, now you learnin', nigga, my gun go off
Call it attempted murder, nigga, I'm tryin' to merk you
When I come back bustin', nigga, my gun go off
Don't try to say I'm trippin' when I get to flippin'
An' I start to clip in, nigga, my gun go off
We call it puttin' work in, leavin' niggas hurtin'
Homicide's learkin', nigga, my gun go off
