{Upon initial contact with Ice-T's music
I had envisioned him to be an ill mannered and psychologically
Unstable man with an extremely uneducated and barbaric frame of mind
His raps displayed nothing but ridiculous jargon
Shocking sexual audacity and repulsive images of the ghetto
However, after further analysis of his music I can deduce
That he is the epitome of antidisestablishmentarianism
Who embodies the entire spectrum of the urban experience and struggle
But to make things more plain and simple to the laymen
I find Ice-T to be the dopest, flyist, O.G. pimp hustler, gangster player
Hardcore motherfucker, living today
To be honest, I'm totally and completely on his dick}
