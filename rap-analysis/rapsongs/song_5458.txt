[Missy - Verse One]
Don't explain, you never change
Same old thing, same old game
Say ya want, to be wit' me
But show me my ring
Baby, let me think
I been, in the cold
The story untold, about to unfold
How do you expect me
To ever believe, you won't be wit' me
[Chorus - Missy (Nicole)]
Why you all in my grill (why, you all, in)
Can you pay my bills (can you pay my bills)
Let me know if you will (let me know, let me know)
'cause a chick gotta live (a chick like me, I got to live)
[Missy - Verse Two]
Talk is talk, and talk is cheap
Tell it to her, don't say it to me
'cause I know, I'm in control
See tricks are for kids, and boo I'm too old
Go 'head, with your games
Don't ever come back, to me again
Where you go, remember me
I'm the best thing in history
[Chorus - Missy (Nicole)]
Why you all in my grill (why, why, why)
Can you pay my bills (can you pay my bills)
Let me know if you will (let me know, boy, boy)
'cause a chick gotta live (a chick got to live, ooh yea)
[Bridge One - Missy (Nicole)]
Third time (third time)
I moved you in, took you back
In my life (I was a fool)
I don't know, what's wrong with me
Third time (third time)
I moved you in, took you back
In my life
[Chorus - Missy (Nicole)]
Why you all in my grill (why you all, in my grill)
Can you pay my bills (can you pay my bills, yea)
Let me know if you will (let me know, let me know, baby, baby)
'cause a chick gotta live (a chick like me, I got to live, yea)
[Bridge Two - Missy]
If you want me
Where's my dough
Give me money
Buy me clothes
No need for talking
Have my dough
Where's my money
Where's my clothes
If you want me
(repeat)
[Big Boi]
Aight, uh
While you all in my grill, I'm thinkin' it's time to chill
But you want to drill tho
I couldn't even step out the baby blue vehicle 'cause you be tryna kill my hoe
My girlfriend, and people around me is tellin' me that you's a stalker
Like Darth Vader checks a Skywalker
I told you I was the street talker
It ain't my fault you wearin' your Victoria's Secrets and your Frederick's
Wanted to wander 'round the store, instead I took you to Cedric's
To entertain you, to DO YOU TO THE G, and never claim you
Me and Missy, we gettin' straight fucked, boo
Yeah we puffin' up one of them thangs too
You blamin' boo, you maimin' who
I know you ain't bringin' that lame crew
Big Boi, and them phat sacks
Chief Bridget, Dee, all they same boo
But I'm back by the Dungeon Family
So you can go 'head wit' al that stabbin' me
'cause I will jab the, and slam the
And Bobby will save that ass, geeYea, huh
(music till fade)
