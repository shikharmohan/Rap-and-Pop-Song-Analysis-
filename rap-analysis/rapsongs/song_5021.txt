Lupe!
Ho, Verbal
F-N-F U-P
Yeah, we do what we do
Chicago Mann
Can you let me know?
Baby can we get up together?
I ain't like those chicks, I'll treat you better
Don't waste no more time
Baby let's go
Maybe we can go
Baby I'm down to do whatever
I don't really care, it doesn't matter
Let's not waste no time
Maybe, let's go
Love, you gotta love it
Hold hands in public
I does it, cool
I dug it
Everything you do
And everything you doesn't
Everything you done
Hope I'm the one you does it to
Hope this trick goes wrong
And I'm cut in two
So I can feel it twice as much as two Lu's
To lose is something that I never wanna do
I' too loose to check on this track like choo
Choose, to choose, I'd rather have you
Even if it's half
And I'll even hold for the whole if I have to
But I don't wanna one
That's too close to none, come
But get rid of the gun
It's covered in clues
The one that you used
To kill off the player inside
And I brought back some flowers from the funeral for you
You should come and make moves with a brother like uh
Can you let me know?
Baby can we get up together?
I ain't like those chicks, I'll treat you better
Don't waste no more time
Baby let's go
Maybe we can go
Baby I'm down to do whatever
I don't really care, it doesn't matter
Let's not waste no time
Maybe, let's go
Yeah,I go by the name of Verbal
Yea let's go
Yo
It all happened in a second
My universe froze
Ain't a situation I chose
But it chose me
When I caught a glimpse
Of the beautiful, just posin'
I know all the rappers be talkin' about clothes and hoes
But she ain't that type, ya see
Anyway I'm still froze
Like MegaTron in chryogenic form
I need to get warm
Shes my cue
I gotta transform
So I could come through with whatever she wants
She's already glossed and flossed with charm like the 4 seas
Can't imagine what her closet with cost me
Yeah. my brain spin with velocity
Thinking about ways to get up
Wishin', but I can't, so I could be the man
So I just stand, wishin' I could have her
Can you let me know?
Baby can we get up together?
I ain't like those chicks, I'll treat you better
Don't waste no more time
Baby let's go
Maybe we can go
Baby I'm down to do whatever
I don't really care, it doesn't matter
Let's not waste no time
Maybe, let's go
Can you let me know?
Baby can we get up together?
I ain't like those chicks, I'll treat you better
Don't waste no more time
Baby let's go
Maybe we can go
Baby I'm down to do whatever

Let's not waste no time
Maybe, let's go
Yeah, uh uh
Yeah, at times like this
I dunno what to do but to rhyme like this
She probably don't even know I exsist
Can't figure out why I can't take this
Yeah, at times like this
I'm wishing I could be a little stronger than this
Too many worries and pre-requisites
Just to reach ya, just to be with ya
So far, still so far apart, all I want is just to talk
Uh uh uh
I swear to God
Yeah
So far, still so far apart, all I want is just to talk
I swear to God
