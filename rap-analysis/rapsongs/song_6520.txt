I am Sir Dogg, DPG, fuck and I hate water
I never learned to swim
Aah, put me down, let go of my leg
I hate water, I can't swim, aah
Now matter where I go, you got'cha eyes on me
And everybody sittin' around, waitin' on me
Show us how you do it, Uncle Snoopy
So fluid wit' your technique, y'all niggaz gon' respect me
Man, I been doin' dis' shit before I even learned how to crawl, though
Gettin' interviewed by mothafuckaz like Geraldo
And niggaz wanna know if I smoke Newports or Marlboros?
Man, I'm fuckin' wit' dat real shit, nigga can you feel dis'?
I make dat shit for the realest of millions
While I'm wheelin' and dealin' and feelin the feelin'
Hmm and oh, what a relief it is
That Snoop is back in dis, mothafucka handlin' his biz
Takin' care of his kids and makin' hits, oh, shit
There it is again, you never know if your career might flop, fizz
So, stay on your toes and keep a pair wit'cha foes
And keep a set of new hoes and floatin' and tie da bow
Fuck these niggaz and peep out Whitey Ro
Somebody told? Well then, somebody gettin' rolled on
And that's usually how the scenario rolls on
Baby girl said she wanna keep her clothes on
She either fuckin', gettin' stole on or gotta stroll home
Well number one, keep your hand on your gun
And don't trust anyone, ohh, you can't trust nobody, baby
You can't even trust your own Mama
This is Snoopy Collins, trust no one, especially a bitch
Or even a bitch ass, nigga, yo, ha
T R U S T in me, I'm sexy but I'm pussy
The homies in the hood call me Lil' Bo Peep
And you da type a nigga, I been dyin' ta meet
So Snoopy, what'chu tryin' to do?
Now hold on lil' mama, ain't no reason for me to lie to you
Now what I'm tryin' to do and what I'm gon' do
Is hit this bud, I got a wife at home
Bitch, I ain't lookin' for none
You might got kids for 'cuz or down wit' bud
Pushin' them dubs, look here 'cuz
Lemme tell you how it's gon' be
If I was broke loc, these bitches wouldn't want me
I'm tellin' you the good God truth, you want proof?
Ask them hoes over there, "Y'all wanna fuck, Snoop?"
We'll take the money and the game away
I bet they won't say the same that day
But it's okay 'cuz I don't trip
'Cuz, "Bitches, ain't shit but hoes and tricks"
I thought I told you, bitch, I'm a soulja
East side, long beach, gang bang roller
From the solar 'cuz this is it
Can ya dig it? I can dig it
Jelly Roll, pulled a rabbit out his hat
I pull a strap out my mothafuckin' back, aah, 'cuz I know it's like dat
I'm in a meetin' wit' these white folks talkin' bread
They want a contract on a nigga till' I'm dead
If I don't sign they gon' turn me over to the feds
They struck me out, now I'm pinch hittin' for the Reds
But I'm a Dodger Blue, so I gotta keep it true
I gotta home run, nigga we long gone
I'm realizin', justizin', visualizin'
Rip ridin', put mines in
Takin' this game to the next level
Trustin' no one, especially them Red Devils
Keep ya head level, hand on my get up
Stay on the red up, pimpin' ain't easy
But there's a whole lot of fed up
And like I told you from the get go
Don't trust no one, like I told you from the getti, don't trust no one
Oh, no, you did it again, put me down
I hate water, I can't swim, I never learned to swim
I shouldn't have trusted you, I put all of my trust in you
And you took me to the water, oh , no
