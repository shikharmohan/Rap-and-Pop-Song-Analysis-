Me da orignial ras cluda
Jean Paul Claude!
(Aiy, aiy, aiy, aiy)
Jusy give me some room!
(Stinkin gwal!)
Make ya momma sing!
My guns, my funds keep both in eyes range
Put holes in foes who believe that I change
Hot slugs in thugs who pose and act tough
So quick to get kidnapped and smacked up
My ways amazed
All those opposing
I'm grown, I own extensive clothing
Go shopping, go cope five pairs of Hoagings
The five elite bet Fox is chosing
Can't beat her clone her
Know some bitches who boasting like Winola
Ya'll know Fox is a rider
But if needed put six shots inside her
Leave her dead in the basement
Get a replacement
Got reason to fear Fox
Scare rap bitches half to death
To knees shake and tears drop
Jump in car when I hear cops
One girl, me against the world
How can you not compare Pac?
Me da orignial ras cluda
Jean Paul Claude!
(Aiy, aiy, aiy, aiy)
Jusy give me some room!
(Bloodclots)
Make ya momma sing!
F-O, X-Y
You know the kids raw
The streets it self is what I live for
My "Reign" remain, some hoes I'm fading
The flow you know is most amazing
My slanted eyes, I'll never trade in
Trini in me and mixed wit Asain
See I know how fe-el to start broke
I'm hood, I could still roll thru Park Slope
It's the music that you hear on blocks
My raps got through ya blood like a herion shot
Jeah!
I got these rap dudes switching sides
I'm the gutterest, goodiest bitch alive and
Fox 5, believe my team works
I'ma silent partner 
Call me Kareem Burks 
I'ma spit long as you find me along
The Firm bitch!
First chick to true Bonnie & Clyde, pussy
Me da orignial ras cluda
Jean Paul Claude!
(Aiy, aiy, aiy, aiy)
Jusy give me some room!
(Bloodclots)
Make ya momma sing!
(Hey, hey! Girnd dem pussy!)
Check it, check it

My accent flows, ya'll know my shit rocks
Orignial true bad gal of hip-hop
DEM NOT READY!
G'wan no my shit knocks
Ya'll have reason to fear Fox
Scare rap bitches half the death
Till knees shake and tears drop
Jump in the car when I hear cops
One girl, me against the world
How can you hate the Brown Fox?
Me da orignial ras cluda
Jean Paul Claude!
(Aiy, aiy, aiy, aiy)
Jusy give me some room!
