(V-town)
Thangs fine, in the middle of the street, sirens and violins silence
Muthafuckas play for keeps, violins and diamonds on my grand piano
Turn the channel, lemme see that, gimme that back
Muthafucka fool, what's your problem?
(What's your problem?)
Nigro, why you wanna pull all on the side of my column?
Column, shot 'em, shot 'em, got 'em, stick 'em, lose 'em, stock 'em
Bitch 'em, dodge 'em, block 'em, stock 'em, rock 'em, chop 'em
Scheme 'em, plottin', plot 'em, 45 special, 45 special
Nigga with the four five realize
I got this monkey on my back, shit be funky that's a fact
Screamin' up in them swamps though, pocket fulla twamps though
To stomp hoe, totin' my pistal
Up and down them side streets up in my vehicle
Calli still, rallys fell, French quarters at night
Smoke blunts, get the money, and make shit right
Were smokin' weed pipe, niggas stuff it and roll
Just some fools 'bout they paper, way out of control

Where the drug dealers slang and the killers they blast
Pass the grass, gimme the weed, smash the gas, we actin' bad

Fuckin' with niggas like E four O and B-Legit
Y'all niggas got a pay to feed the men, we the men
Do it fast or slow, we dressed up straight from a fashion show
Passin' hoes, ain't nothing on the wall
In the hall but platinum and gold
I put the dick on the track, and break they back
To the mighty N.O., came fame, when I brought it to the top
Here we go, in this bitch
