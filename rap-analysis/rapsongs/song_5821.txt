Woman like my momma
Ain't no woman like my momma
Ain't no woman like my momma
Ain't no woman like my momma
Momma, life ain't cool
  (Ain't no woman like my momma)
(Ain't no woman like my momma)
Tell me, what would I do without you?
  (Ain't no woman like my momma)
(Ain't no woman like my momma)
Momma, life ain't cool
  (Ain't no woman like my momma)
(Ain't no woman like my momma)
Tell me, what would I do without you?
  (Ain't no woman like my momma)
(Ain't no woman like my momma)
Sharin' liquor with the homies, reminiscin' 'bout the old days
Cookin' dinner in your kitchen, listenin' to the bar kays
When I was sick, you came, got me from school
When I got suspended, momma, you taught me the rules
And even though, I never had a daddy
Momma took me where I need to go in a old school caddy
A single parent on welfare
And even though times were hard
Momma made sure the rent was there
And we couldn't fold name brands
But momma kept her kids neat, that's why we understand
And momma even rode the Greyhound
To see her little man, when he was locked down
And even though, I live the street life
Momma prayin' for her baby, hope he get his mind right
It feel good to see momma on top
I told you, if I make it momma, you won't be forgot
Momma, life ain't cool
Ain't no woman like my momma
Tell me, what would I do without you?
Ain't no woman like my momma
Momma, life ain't cool
Ain't no woman like my momma
Tell me what would I do without you?
Ain't no woman like my momma
I thank God, for keeping you strong, but you keep me strong
Things'd be different, if momma wasn't home
Who gon' fix the grits and eggs and smoked sausage
Teach me and love me and raise me and watch me
Who gon' lift my spirits when I get sad?
Discipline me, when I need a stain whip on my ass
I was seven years old, when I lost dad
Trying to accept the fact but I was too young to understand
Who gon' take the slack and carry the load?
Make ends meet while in the grocery stores?
Who's the single parent to me and my big sister
That had me happy on my birthday and merry at Christmas?
Who took care of us, did everything for us?
Stood by and didn't leave, just because
We was yours, she was ours
Who was still sweet when everything went sour?
Momma, life ain't cool
Ain't no woman like my momma
Tell me what would I do without you?
Ain't no woman like my momma
Momma, life ain't cool
  (Ain't no woman like my momma)
(Ain't no woman like my momma)
Tell me, what would I do without you?
  (Ain't no woman like my momma)
(Ain't no woman like my momma)
I couldn't imagine gettin' this far, without you
Even when the bills was due, you found a way to come through
Even though we didn't have money, we seemed rich
We had each other me and my sisters and brothers
Forget the other shit
You was side by side when I was sick
Early in the morning, cooking eggs and grits
You was the first one up, but you was the last one sleepin'
Made sure we had somethin' to eat, last one to eatin'
Couldn't live our life for us so, let us know
Wanted to tell us, but you had to just, let us grow
Gettin' older now, soon have to, let us go
We was goin' through some things, momma
But you never let it show
And I only get one of you so I cherish the times
Didn't know how to tell you how much you
Meant to me so I wrote that line
So wherever you at, I hope you doin' fine
You did so much for me then, I'll do the same for you in time
Momma, life ain't cool
(Ain't no woman like my momma)
Tell me, what would I do without you?
  (Ain't no woman like my momma)
(Ain't no woman like my momma)
Momma, life ain't cool
  (Ain't no woman like my momma)
(Ain't no woman like my momma)
Tell me, what would I do without you?
  (Ain't no woman like my momma)
(Oh, I love my momma)
Momma, life ain't cool
Tell me, what would I do without you?
Momma, life ain't cool
Tell me, what would I do without you?
