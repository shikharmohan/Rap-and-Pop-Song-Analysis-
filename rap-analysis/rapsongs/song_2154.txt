Let's go baby girl let's go
Let's get the mother fucker flow baby girl let's go
Everybody in the club on the floor for sure
Let's get some mother fucker slap on that's for sure
Let's go baby girl let's go
Let's get the mother fucker flow baby girl let's go
All my niggas in the club on the floor for sure
Let's get some mother fucker slap on that's for sure
Now lets go
Never runnin' outta lingo
40 water right back at 'em with another single
Money longer than the neck on a Flamingo
20,000 on a bet in the casino
I got a partner on parole that just got out of Chino
Not a rookie but a vet like Dan Marino
My favorite actor on the set Al Pacino
This is a heater man, hot like Jalepeno
Follow the leader
40 from califoolya you hearin' in your speaker
My life ain't no cartoon, it's not animated like Seta
Hot like a hot air balloonist I'm just an opportunist
The sooner the better you let me know that we can do this
Excuse me lady I've been lookin' at you from over here
I was wonderin' if I could buy you a beer
And maybe later we could cut
I don't want to be your man
I don't want to be the one, let's have a one night stand
I know I don't know you and stuff
But maybe we could get to know each other
Over a couple of glasses of whatever's in this cup
I don't wanna go and dance
I don't wanna be the one, let's have a one night stand
Let's get it crackin' like some broken bones, money makin'
Talkin' on them burnout phones, Cadillacin'
Wood grain dash, and doors and floor mats
Good game cash, I stash the store raps
PS2 clarity, diamond watches and super bam botches
Eclair and cotches and choppers fresh out the boxes
I like to polish my rims and tires hundred spokes wide
With Armoral baby wipes 'cause my baby drink wine
Nothin' but the best on the flesh, just like sex
Rubbin' lotion all on her Gluteus Maximus
I don't see no ring all I see is Miss 60 jeans
Walkin' through the club like she ready to do some things
Full of that turtle, got 40 smellin' like skunk
But everybody knows you can't smell yourself when you're drunk
Posted at the bar like a star, I get a bar
Two way me your number, I'll give a player a card
Excuse me lady I've been lookin' at you from over here
I was wonderin' if I could buy you a beer
And maybe later we could cut
I don't want to be your man
I don't want to be the one, let's have a one night stand
I know I don't know you and stuff
But maybe we could get to know each other
Over a couple of glasses of whatever's in this cup
I don't wanna go and dance
I don't wanna be the one, let's have a one night stand
This is for my fuckers who lets in all my guys
There's a new rapper in town, E40's on the rise
Known for Heaven sake with it records and jive ties
Business men always at work like Barry White
The guy with all the slang in the game about the yay
Gorillaz, Marine World, Africa, USA
You feel us, it's sick out here in the bay where we stay
We kill us, I wish that somebody would come and pray
Live life like there ain't no tomorrow, ain't no tomorrow
Life is somethin' that you can't borrow, that you can't borrow
Everyday's a holiday, everyday may we celebrate
Everyday we modulate, everyday may we perculate
Excuse me lady I've been lookin' at you from over here
I was wonderin' if I could buy you a beer
And maybe later we could cut
I don't want to be your man
I don't want to be the one, let's have a one night stand
I know I don't know you and stuff
But maybe we could get to know each other
Over a couple of glasses of whatever's in this cup
I don't wanna go and dance
I don't wanna be the one, let's have a one night stand
Let's go baby girl let's go
Let's get the mother fucker flow baby girl let's go
Everybody in the club on the floor for sure
Let's get some mother fucker slap on that's for sure
Let's go baby girl let's go
Let's get the mother fucker flow baby girl let's go
All my niggas in the club on the floor for sure
Let's get some mother fucker slap on that's for sure
Now lets go
