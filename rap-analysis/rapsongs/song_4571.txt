Mula, babe
She was a young girl in pursuit of glory and fame
She would do anything she could to feel the flame
When everybody knew your mood and the games you played
She finally made all her dreams come true and then she screamed
Oh no, this ain't paradice
Oh no, this ain't paradice
Oh no, this ain't paradice
Oh no, this ain't paradice
Oh no, this ain't paradice
Oh no, this ain't paradice
He was a young boy in pursuit of money and fame
And he would do anything he could to kill the pain
When everybody knew your mood they speaking your name
And oh, all over the late night local news I heard them scream
Oh no, this ain't paradice
Oh no, this ain't paradice
Oh no, this ain't paradice
Oh no, this ain't paradice
Oh no, this ain't paradice
Oh no, this ain't paradice
I say the sun don't shine forever
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And everything that glitter ain't gold
I say love don't love forever
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
When everything that's new gets old
Sometimes we try to find a road to the riches, need roadside assistants
Blisters on my knees from beggin' for forgiveness
Ain't no dollars on my trees but mileage on my feet
'Cause I been climbin' to the peak and runnin' from the bullshit
I'm tired of hearin' the same songs, who told the DJ, bring it back?
Dead president's bullet in Abraham's Lincoln hat
Starin' at big poster I swear that he be winkin' back
Cut school, sell crack, sorry I'm just thinkin' back
Call me crazy I've been called worse
It's like I have it all, but what's it all worth
I'm probably better in my afterlife
I should cherish life but this ain't paradice
Oh no, this ain't paradice
Oh no, this ain't paradice
Oh no, this ain't paradice
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
This ain't paradice
No, this ain't paradice
This ain't paradice
