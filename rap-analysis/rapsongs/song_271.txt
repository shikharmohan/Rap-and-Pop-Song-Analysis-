Yo man, hit me with one of those funky baselines
One baseline at a time
The sun takes a bow for a day well lit
Next act is night with an audience of brothers and sisters
Havin' a celebration of sorts
Meetin' one another, hopin' soon to be lovers
Sisters have always fascinated me
The many shades, the many sizes and features
Such a wide variety of African women
Sometimes leaves me frustrated and speechless
I try not to admire what I can't obtain or have
Things beyond my reach, don't exist to speech
Seein' how I'm a bit shorter than the average man
I patiently wait for someone I can reach
Many sisters don't understand my style
I live my life in an outcast tribe
A tribe that strives to see a brighter day
I foresee that I'll walk with closed eyes, until dawn
Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads
Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads
Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads
Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads
Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads
Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads
Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads
Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads
Rejection is a fear of mine, for one reason or another
But I still asked for a date with this woman
She said, "No", I said ,"Oh"
I forgot there's a gap between the richer and the poorer po'
Slowly, all the shades, sizes and features
Became less different and more the same
Except a certain female with all new features
But I knew not her name
By this time the sun was preparin'
For another appearance, the sky was pure red
The night grabbed the moon and soon
The darkness, yeah, was almost dead
The sky now is orange and the night
Has left the stage with curtains open wide
And the bright sun yawns to signify a glorious bright new day
The glorious day that I would meet, who? Dawn
The natural dread also of the outcast tribe
Knowledgeable enough to understand my style
And as we kiss in the name of rejection
The sky looks at us and warmly smiles
Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads
Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads
Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads
Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads
Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads
Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads
Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads
Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads
Dawn of the dreads
Dawn of the dreads
Dawn of the dreads
Yeah, the dread symbolizes the natural growth
Of not just the hair, but also of the mind
And also the bond that keeps us in love
The struggle enhances that bond, throughout time
When I see her, I see life
The vast scope of life in her eyes of no wrong
Faith plays a big ass part, I'm still kinda young
But I could feel, I could really run with dawn
Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads
Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads
Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads
Dawn of the dreads
Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads
Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads
Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads
Dawn of the dreads
Dawn of the dreads
Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads
Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads
Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads
Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads
Dawn of the dreads, dawn of the dreads
Dawn of the, dawn of the, dawn of the dreads
Dawn of the dreads
It's a brand new song by Arrested Development
Entitled 'Dawn Of The Dreads', I hope you enjoy it
But all you can do now is put both feet up in the air
And swing 'em back and forth to the music, thank you
I say, dawn of the dreads
I say, dawn of the dreads
I say, dawn of the dreads
Dawn of the dreads
