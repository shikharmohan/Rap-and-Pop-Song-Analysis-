{Smash you grilla, that's right, that's right
A hundred and ninety six million, nine hundred and forty thousand
Square miles on this planet, fresh outta New York, aye yo}
Aye yo Rollie, what's up son, Noodles had a problem
He called lucky hand slab saying niggas mobbed him
Max was on a outskirt trickin' in DC
Blaze had a shorty in his lab gettin' weed for free
That night I was in the cut alone zoned out
Suggest I rock a utility vest when I'm bonin' out
Yea you know it, Bobby told me before
Keep the heat by the side of the door
Ready for military war
Numerous cats, niggas is uterus, who this?
Claimin' that he looking for Louis Rich
Diamond a young king doing his thing
Big safes out in Beijing, aqua green thing
One connect had turned on him
God, shit got realer than a fuck
Crackers up state want him
Marshals came through the hood that night
Bagged my man chaz thirty two bags he copped flight
Now he upstate baggin' niggas, house and air maxs big axe
Won the Oscar award for crabbing niggaa now
All y'all niggas get to laugh now, who got the last laugh now?
Hit his stash house
It's called real life, y'all niggas betta see the light fast pa
Real life, it don't cost nothin' just to blast, real life
Lay down son you won't last
Real life, real life, real life
February tenth day on a Wednesday, it's like grimsday
Russian hats rocking it the Benz way
That day we got guns on us, Jakes want us
Playin' Einstein lenses and Auroras
Little meek caught us, couple of Francs peep the blue Taurus
What up tuck your chain they came for us
Jumped out, big nine an' some hard bottles
Eyes of hate finally meeting up with the stakes, it was
Who I thought it was two pair of Clarks, one pair of Lugz
With the hard bottom nigga with the snub
Cocked it, where rock at, stop that
Violate this cipher Pa we'll definitely strike back
All of us right there slight fear in our heart
Blink we take it right there doing our thing apart
Broad jumped out tryin' to run shit spoken loud words
All we want is his head, he did some dumb shit
Beef from Miami now, damn yo big head Lance in some wild shit
Noodles caught the stair down, now it came back to me yo
Handle it wise and brutally yo, put down your tool and talk like men
No shots rang yo, hittin' the ground like mangoes
Swiss cheese the thirty G Durango, few weeks later son seem 'em all
I mean 'em all
It's called real life, y'all niggas betta see the light fast pa
Real life, it don't cost nothin' just to blast, real life
Lay down son you won't last
Real life, real life, real life
It's called real life, y'all niggas betta see the light fast pa
Real life, it don't cost nothin' just to blast, real life
Lay down son you won't last
Real life, real life, real life
