(Laughing)
I don't care what y'all say
((Chorus))
(Whoa)
It's time to rock and roll
(Whoa)
This time I'm in control
(Whoa)
Right now I own the streets 
I got the keys to the city
That's 'cause I get down
(Whoa)
Time to rock and roll
(Whoa) 
This time I'm in control
(Whoa) 
Right now I own the streets
I got the keys to the city
That's 'cause I get down
((Verse 1))
Sometimes I wonder
How I made it this far
With all these people hating on me
Y'all know who you are
Take a chance and try to come up
In this game being a star
Now I own the keys 
To a brand new fancy car, baby
It's my turn to burn 
And now I'm here 
To rub it in your face(Ha,Ha,Ha,Oh)
When will you learn, 
I'm the Queen 
And I'll put you in your place
((Chorus))
(Whoa)
It's time to rock and roll
(Whoa)
This time I'm in control
(Whoa)
Right now I own the streets 
I got the keys to the city
That's 'cause I get down
(Whoa)
Time to rock and roll
(Whoa) 
This time I'm in control
(Whoa) 
(bounce)Right now I own the streets
(bounce)I got the keys to the city
(bounce)That's 'cause I get down
((Verse 2)) 
How dare you try to go against 
The glorious one,hon
I'll slaughter your son, 
It's over, 
The story is done
You can be number two 
But I'm second to none
What,you forgot Queen Bee 
Is the Notorious One?
((Verse 3))
Baby,Baby,Baby,Baby
I'm the cream de la cream 
So you can never play me
See I'm more than a lady
I'm more than a lover,
More than enough for you
(Oh)
Please try to understand that
Imma stay at the top 
'cause I don't give a damn
I don't care what y'all say
Imma keep doing me,
I can't fade me
((Chorus))
(Whoa)
It's time to rock and roll
(Whoa)
This time I'm in control
(Whoa)
Right now I own the streets 
I got the keys to the city
That's 'cause I get down
(Whoa)
Time to rock and roll
(Whoa) 
This time I'm in control
(Whoa) 
Right now I own the streets
I got the keys to the city
That's 'cause I get down
((Chorus))
(Whoa)
It's time to rock and roll
(Whoa)
This time I'm in control
(Whoa)
Right now I own the streets 
I got the keys to the city
That's 'cause I get down
(Whoa)
Time to rock and roll
(Whoa) 
This time I'm in control
(Whoa) 
Right now I own the streets
I got the keys to the city
That's 'cause I get
