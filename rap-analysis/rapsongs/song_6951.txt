Oh what's up everybody this is Rick James
Talib Kweli, DJ Hi Tek, reflection eternal
We make the music that change your life
'Bout to touch you just right
All night we gonna shine the light
'Bout to touch you just right
We make the music that change your life
'Bout to touch you just right
All night we gonna shine the light
'Bout to touch you just right
Pia Khan floating on the mighty clouds of joy
Building a future yo for my daughter and baby boy
I moved form the hood yet the shit is still in me
And your opinion is nothing to me
I have plenty like bein' out of prison with a roof over my dome
And possessing the gift such as sparking the microphone
Accumulate the provolone makin' it happen with Talib
A Nattian cat we got 'em snappin' Roberta Flackin' the track and
Killin' em softly with out flossin' but yet the shine is glossy
And where the lyrical train through your brain shit
Strategy pain, I'm on some Clubber Lang shit
With the iron, ain't no use in you trying, I ain't lyin'
Through your ears mesmerize 'em
It's about time the genuine has started risin'
Once again replace bullets with words
Try to make it fun again
We make the music that change your life
'Bout to touch you just right
All night we gonna shine the light
'Bout to touch you just right
We make the music that change your life
'Bout to touch you just right
All night we gonna shine the light
'Bout to touch you just right
If they put my life on the screen then it's got to be the I-Max
I live large stroke your mind, till you reach climax
Terrorist hijack on Hi Tek fly tracks front don't try that
My niggas got my back, you gotta relax, ease back
What's that all about with the feedback?
All up in my mouth we don't need that enjoy life open up a tree sac
Take a trip [Incomprehensible] Asphalt is the place to be at
Where the people fire burn so bright, you can see that believe that
It ain't light music, no, we make the right music, true
Keep it tight music, yes, affirmin' life music, come on
We make the music that change your life
'Bout to touch you just right
All night we gonna shine the light
'Bout to touch you just right
We make the music that change your life
'Bout to touch you just right
All night we gonna shine the light
'Bout to touch you just right
It's like girls got the bass all up in they hips
My favorite part on the face is the shape of the lips
Yeah I wanna touch you there
Your mind is my concubine, when I deliver shivers up your spine
[Incomprehensible]
Like the bread and wine, my brains has embedded with rhymes
That's ahead of they time, I rock with the better design
You cats ain't got the touch you all suck, like getting head from a dime
I run up in 'em and, touch him with the rhythm and
Clutch 'em if they tremblin', it's a rush like adrenaline
At a point break the joint shake when you play this shit
Your crew is haters when we come through with the newest, latest
Reflection eternal
Shine light bright like the day till the sky turn purple
And the moon arrive, reflectin' light through the night
That touch you just right
With the rhythm, the rhythm, God bless the rhythm
It's the rhythm, the rhythm, yes y'all the rhythm
Shorty on the dance floor giving me rhythm
Hi Tek make y'all nod y'all neck to the rhythm and
We make the music that change your life
'Bout to touch you just right
All night we gonna shine the light
'Bout to touch you just right
We make the music that change your life
'Bout to touch you just right
All night we gonna shine the light
'Bout to touch you just right
Clap your hands everybody
