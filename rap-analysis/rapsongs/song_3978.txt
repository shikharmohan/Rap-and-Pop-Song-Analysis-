He treats me like a queen I love the way he abores me 
Makin love in the Ferrari he just bought me 
Playing Playstation, Fight night

Form the bed to the kitchen to the living room couch 
We done blessed every room in this New York penthouse 
Miami estate house by the lake 
we ain't watchin pornos we watchin our own sex tape 
I caught a kenny all over his jimmy 
so when he stick it in me he dunk off the kimmy
I make a nigga bust faster then a semy 
cause Kimmy with kenny the rock harder then a penny 
Full body massage, champaign, bubble bath 
Then we make love on a bed made of cash 
He can't get enough he always ready to smash 
He loves how I'm shaped just like an hour glass 
His niggas tight Cause he chillin with his wife 
But they don't come his love of his life 
We in the crib havin a pillow fight I heard Lodis popin it off tonight (But!) 
I ain't going to the club or hangin with my girls 
I'm chillin with ma nigga tonight 
R.Kelly got a show but I can't go 
I'm chillin with ma nigga tonight 
Victora Secret lingerie on layin up with ma nigga tonight 
When we about to get it on so turn off the phone it's all about my man tonight
