Now I don't, I used to
Love him, now I don't, now I don't
As I look at what I've done, the type of life that I've lived
How many things I pray the Father will forgive
One situation involved a young man
He was the ocean and I was the sand
He stole my heart like a thief in the night
Dulled my senses and blurred my sight
And I used to love him but now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
I chose the road of passion and pain
Sacrificed too much and waited in vain
Gave up my power, ceased being queen
Addicted to love like the drug of, drug of a fiend
See, torn and confused, wasted and used
Reached the crossroad, which path would I choose?
Stuck and frustrated I waited, debated
For somethin' to happen that just wasn't fated
Thought what I wanted was somethin' I needed
When Momma said no, then I just should have heeded
Misled, I bled till the poison was gone
And out of the darkness arrived the sweet dawn
I used to love him, but now I don't
I used to love him, yeah yeah yeah, but now I don't
Father, you saved me and you showed me that life
Was much more than being some foolish man's wife
Showed me that love was respect and devotion
Greater than planets and deeper than any ocean
See, my soul was weary, but now it's replenished
Content because that part of my life is finished
I see him sometimes and the look in his eye
Is one of a man who's lost treasures untold
But my heart is guilty, I took back my soul
And totally let my Creator control
The life which was his
The life which was his, to begin with
Now I don't, I used to
Love him, now I don't
Now I don't, I used to
Love him, now I don't
Now I don't, I used to
Love him, now I don't
Now I don't, I used to
Love him, now I don't, now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
I used to love him, yeah yeah yeah, but now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
