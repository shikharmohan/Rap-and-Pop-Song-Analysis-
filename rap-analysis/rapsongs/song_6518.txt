Getting sick and tired of the same stuff

Nina do this and Tina do that
Sabrina, Sakina, nigga, them all my hoodrats
Back in the days when I was on the block
At an early age man
I was on the couch
Nonstop, I beat it up and tell that bitch to get going
(They be like hot butter on a breakfast toast)
Hollarin' out, poppin' a collar out
And talkin' shit on the phone to me at my baby moma's house
Who's she? Look here bitch, do you know who the fuck I am
You better read your motherfuckin' first telegram
You remind me of this bitch that used to work for me
Had to cut the bitch up 'cause she tried to get too close to me
And tried to confront me at a club one night
Fuckin' with her friend, a fake bitch, is that right?
But you know I had to stop and appause
And I put my hand on my balls
And said, "Check this out, what's up dog?"
I got bitches all in my game
That don't even know my name
Then pump your brakes, you hoes
Biotch
You could talk all day behind my back
But won't say, "Shit" in my face
Then pump your brakes, you hoes
Biotch
You are the one, you are the one
You are the one, you are the one, you are the one, hooo
You are so sexy, sexy, sexy, you are so sexy
You are the one, you are the one
You are the one, you are the one, you are the one, hoo hoo
You are so sexy, sexy, sexy
I got my own spot and I got my own keys
So can't no bitch talk shit to me
Like Kiki did me, bitch changed the locks
And kicked me up outta spot
I learned a lesson, I wasn't guessin' or stressin'
I got another bitch and she was at the convalesent home
She said she needed a companion
Shit, I needed a chaperone plus a new home
Snap, crack, it's on
But in no time at all seems she fell in love
But I wasn't ready for that
Topcat had to scat
I hit her friend from the back
While she was at work workin'
I was jerkin' that skirt
And fuckin' with all her friends that was flirtin'
And when she found out, she told me that, that shit hurt
A week later, she fell in love with my homeboy Kurt
Bitch you ain't shit but dirt for dirt, biotch
I got bitches all in my game
That don't even know my name
Then pump your brakes, you hoes
Biotch
You could talk all day behind my back
But won't say, "Shit" in my face
Then pump your brakes, you hoes
Biotch
You are the one, you are the one
You are the one, you are the one, you are the one, hooo
You are so sexy, sexy, sexy, you are so sexy
You are the one, you are the one
You are the one, you are the one, you are the one, hoo hoo
You are so sexy, sexy, sexy
I got bitches all in my game
That don't even know my name
Then pump your brakes, you hoes
Biotch
You could talk all day behind my back
But won't say, "Shit" in my face
Then pump your brakes, you hoes
Biotch
