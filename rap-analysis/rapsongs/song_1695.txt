Complex
(Just ease it in)
The feelings right
The music is tight
  (The music's tight)
Departin' out of Crooklyn, type Saturday night
The Gear, The God, was rockin' type, way out of sight
Limpin' past the market scene, my man, aight
Steelo type fat, solar type facts
Later for milk and honey
Get the money out this piece, relax
(Relax)
I handle streets, all type slick
Just like a seven no lash
She got moist 'cause I got's the platinum voice
Like syrup, for delf roamin', the New York Boroughs
As they temp our perms, plus I ride the iron worms
Uptown across down, from the boogie with no fake
Ghetto to my marrow then ease on back to Crooklyn
Hold it, has loot in my timbs and army suits
Parlayin' where Malcolm stood, now brother's plus they blow out
A slicker nigga pig, dig me picking my fuckin' 'fro out
Limpin' up the one tree fives, the P jects, the eject these herbs
That's word to green herb, not the curbs
I play that like, primo supreme hustler
Nappy hair, oil slick, loyal to kick and dirty snare, little panther
Answers to the nom de plum butter
Nice, preciser, rubber, slicer and cutter
In a freshly dip state, I contemplate
Who's avenue be makin' the most bacon
My honey gets the loot out
We're shaking?
We gettin' live
Dreamin' bein' in the Central Ave. bus stop
Then I call bust out, wassup?
Seems that the dream teams me
Mecca, The God and Sulaiman
If their beats is phatty
And it's on then I'm gone
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Easin' in as slick as I can
Easin' in as slick as I can
  (Slick as I can)
Easin' in as slick as I can
Easin' in, zoom
Easin' in as slick as I can
Easin' in, slick
You know my motions, slimmer with no limo
I ride the C local and tilt my army brimmer
Milt bless the vibes, pro symbolize
Built with the fives, my clique then amplified
Sounds as we ease beneath the New York moon
Pounds as we dip increase these New York tunes
It's the universe I have
Nappy and happy, June 12th
I self don't say that exists, imported on the ships
With irons around the fist
Gradual to afros, black cats and fist picks
Still creatin' boogies and the styles they want
Now they try to move us for the styles we flaunt
But I, seen it sunny, plus seen rain
Plus seen my moneys gettin' smoked for change
I face left in the round up
Pound up The God when the devil wished the cents
Blaowed to the essence sinks
Deep down into the blue train cover
The real got surreal 'cause we feel you ain't a ganster
When I was a youngster, ate jazz and black
Freedom had a pistol, it was just like that
Old earth gave me kisses to her coach of power records
Pumas, these flavors, busy B mic. checkin's
The crowd says I'm down from the ground up
But what if emcee comes, come on, emcee go
Easin' in as slick as I can
Easin' in as slick as I can
  (As slick as I can)
Easin' in as slick as I can
Easin in zoom
Easin' in as slick as I can
Easin' in as slick as I can
  (Slick as I can)
Easin' in as slick as I can
Easin in, yeah, slick
The feelin's right
The music's tight
  (The music's tight)
Departin' out of Crooklyn type, Saturday night
The gear, The God, was rockin' type, way out of sight
Limpin' past the market scene, my man, aight
When the mic, check counts my amount is cash
I don't shoot out, I get that loot out 'cause I'm fresh
Hit you with the gold front rim with diamond look
Muhammad made 'em, Nikki paid him, I was shook
I tell an emcee in a eye blink
That you whack as crack
 (Whack)
C know got my back
And we both can laugh
And for example, we swift this, lifted up on luck
And for complexion like brass and brown skin
We of this, built this with South, Boogie Down Bronx
Ask the clowns, in the suits with the cash
I tell 'em, pass the ruck
Or get stuck by my comrades badge
Just like my mom and dad had it
And did it
Easin' in as slick as I can
Easin' in as slick as I can
  (As slick as I can)
Easin' in as slick as I can
Easin' in as slick as I can
Easin' in as slick as I can
Easin' in as slick as I can
  (Slick as I can)
Easin' in as slick as I can
Easin' in as slick as I can
