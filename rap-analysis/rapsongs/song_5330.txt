It's entertainment time
Got Missy Elliott in the house
Got Slick Rick in the house
We doing big things here kids
Hip-Hop's finest, slick, slick, Slick Rick an' M
Slick Rick an' M
Go Missy, go Missy, go Missy, go Missy
  (Slick Rick an' M)
Excuse me Mr. Lawrence, you look nice
Simply delicious, Missy want some kisses
Let's go to the crib, get cozy in the nude
And 'Treat me like a prostitute'
Now pardon me sir, I'm such a real lady
Ride in Mercedes to make the bitches hate me
Cruise up and down one-two-fifth
Looking for a guy like you to get with
I seen this cutie pie, so I pulled beside him
Seen the size of his feet, so I couldn't deny him
Might as well try him, the freak that I am
M dot S E always grinding
Please don't think I'm crazy
But boy you are supa fine
Do it to me, do it to me
  (Thank you Missy)
Irresistible delicious, holla
Enough to make me lose my mind
Now I really want it
  (Slick, slick, Slick Rick an' M)
Now I want it, don't make me wait so  long
No don't make me wait so long
Missy, no longer will I pretend
  (Slick Rick in the house)
Let's get it on 'cause we both grown
  (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Intelligent, delicate, watch how the fella get
Bump into my home girl in Miami, Missy Elliott
Green blush on her eyelid, hi Miss
Gave honey a hug, I feel her touching my privates
Aw shuck I guess, main course is in I said
"You know I'm married?"
Yeah and what's that supposed to mean?
Proposition for you Ruler
Proceed on
Well, I got a track I need you spit a mean 16 on
You with it?
Down to bless one and I left one
The Hit Factory, later on around eleven
With my notebook and pencil, I slides on in
I see her looking mighty sexy and the lights all dim
Have a drink
The booze and the karmy go oddly
After having a drink I start to feel unusually horny
Swelling stone or well writ poems
Busy pounding like I'm trying to break off pelvis bones
Please don't think I'm crazy
Slick Rick's in the house
But boy you are supa fine
Do it to me, do it to me
  (Thank you Missy)
Irresistible delicious, holla
  (Slick Rick's in the house)
Enough to make me lose my mind, lose my mind
Now I really want it and now I want it
Don't make me wait so long
No don't make me wait so long
No longer will I pretend
  (Boss of the females)
Let's get it on 'cause we both grown
  (Recognize, recognize)
Excuse me sir, oh gosh you look young
But old enough to get it to get yo' head sprung
Sit down relax, it's soft here on my couch
Or give me hands strictly you might get turned out
Cutie pie, 'til I sit beside him
Nice shoe size, how could I deny him?
Big bankroll to help me retire
Me and him together smell like big empire
Don't 'Treat me like a prostitute'
Unless you're giving me some money
Making sure I look cute, what?
But don't 'Treat me like a prostitute'
Unless you're giving me some money
Making sure I look cute
Please don't think I'm crazy
Please don't think I'm crazy
But boy you are supa fine
Do it to me, do it to me, fine
