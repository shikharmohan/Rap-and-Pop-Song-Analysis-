[Enrique Iglesias]
I know you want me
I made it obvious that I want you too
So put it on me
Let's remove the space between me and you
Now rock your body
Damn I like the way that you move
So give it to me
'Cause I already know 
What you wanna do
Here's the situation
Been to every nation
Nobody's ever made me feel the way that you do
You know my motivation
Give in my reputation
Please excuse I don't mean to be rude
But tonight I'm loving you
Oh you know
That tonight I'm loving you
Oh you know
That tonight I'm loving you
Oh you know
That tonight I'm loving you
Oh you know
That tonight I'm loving you
You're so damn prettu
If I had a __ baby it would be you
I know you're ready
If I never liked them baby
You'd be truth
Here's the situation
Been to every nation
Nobody's ever made me feel the way that you do
You know my motivation
Give in my reputation
Please excuse I don't mean to be rude
But tonight I'm loving you
Oh you know
That tonight I'm loving you
Oh you know
That tonight I'm loving you
Oh you know
That tonight I'm loving you
Oh you know
That tonight I'm loving you
[Ludacris]
Tonight I'm gonna do
Everiting that I want with you
Everiting That you need
Everiting that you want
I wanna hunt it
I wanna start with you
From the windows to the walls
Gotta give you my all
Winter and the Summer my all
When I get you one that springs 
I'mm make you fail
You got that body
That make me wanna
Get up on the floor
Just to see you dance
And Ilove the way
You Shake that ass
Turn around
And let me see them pants
You're stuck with me
And I'm stuck with you
Let's find something to do
Please excuse me
I don't mean to be rude
[Enrique Iglesias]
