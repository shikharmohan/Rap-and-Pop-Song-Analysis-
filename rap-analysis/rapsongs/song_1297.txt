Look who's back on the program
Hookin up another fly joint when I flow on the slow jam.
When I shift I kick to go
Like I fat drunk and I light up a fat spliff.
Take a wiff can you smell that in the air
When the smoke come out the building from every where.
Shit I still get down so just sit down 
When my thoughts  stops  crawling 
Time to sit down with
Yet I go wrong you  got to hit my bong 
Later on then i4ll  be getting high  all alone 
You got a friend named mary jane 
And she make me feel stange,
Now  I've got  to call out her name.
Can I call mari juanna 
If you wanna party 
Wiile shit I'm gonna as soon as she comes out
Round to my neighberhood 
Damm and she alwyas smells good
Let me make this understood
Are you expirienced
Have you ever been experienced
Not for the life..... make you delerious
Why is the room spinnin 
I can't stop now 
I've must have been drinking 
Cause this ain't pot
That's doing me like this
I feel ill now I'm calling out to mary
Cause I just can't deal .
