You know how good it can be if I took you home with me
I know the mood is right, I don't wanna be alone tonight
Come on let's dip shawty, dip, let's dip shawty, dip
Let's dip shawty, dip, let's dip shawty
Can I get a chance? Grown man from afar superstar status, holdin' on to
The apparatus firmly, west shake, show love, heat 'em up in the club
If you don't care, conversations short, too many Newport's blowing
Me away to another broad, I mean cutie with the nice round booty
Cut to the spot where all the girls wanna do me
On the low, nice and slow, T-Mo on the floor, out the door let's go
Keep it on the hush, don't wanna rush when your ready
We can touch some G's and blow trees in the wind
With a zip, I'm there, telling tales, out on bail
SWAT's tales of rolling boulders and breaking shoulders
Taking me closer to a poacher with that roll line
Shawty 'cause I'm down for mine
You know how good it can be if I took you home with me
I know the mood is right, I don't wanna be alone tonight
Come on let's dip shawty, dip, let's dip shawty, dip
Let's dip shawty, dip, let's dip shawty
We at the club 112 on the front row, shawty done shot the Cuervo
Even though she dancing with another niggeroe
Somewhere out on the floor, she told me
Lo snap your finger when your ready to go
So you know I feel great, I can hardly wait
Hit the Waffle House and get a chicken-melt plate
Scrambled eggs with cheese and a pile of grease
And get full as a tick 'bout ready to drip
And oh for trilly, shawty don't be silly
Calm your nerves 'cause I'm back on that Philly
Cheifed like a champ and everything is good
I got to much class and I'll take you to school
I wanna act a fool but I'm waiting patiently
It ain't good if it ain't been mentioned with me
And if your number fuck around and get hard to find
All I really wanna be is a thought in your mind
You know how good it can be if I took you home with me
I know the mood is right, I don't wanna be alone tonight
Come on let's dip shawty, dip, let's dip shawty, dip
Let's dip shawty, dip, let's dip shawty
Can I take you home? You grown, sip a tea, nice feet
Eyes fly too, saw you when you came through
By yourself girl, no crew, can I hold you?
Can I show you everything in life that I've been through
We can roll in the hills in my big wheel
98 Lank Lank with the Stank Stank
These lights, this night, my dream, your screams
Silk sheets, we meet, what? You need a ride, I got Fleet's
Leather seats with the woodgrain head back
When I drop it like that, baby don't act
How many times do I say that I want your love
Let's dip this club
You know how good it can be if I took you home with me
I know the mood is right, I don't wanna be alone tonight
Come on let's dip shawty, dip, let's dip shawty, dip
Let's dip shawty, dip, let's dip shawty
God led me to the Shark Bar on a Wednesday with the dreads
White derby, looking delicious, good enough to eat
And what do I see, staring at me
A nice pair of eyes, Coke bottle figure, wig, done to a T
Dressed in gangsta black, ready to be attacked by a real mack
Playing hard to get it, so I dips upstairs
How long will it take for my earrings to withdrawal?
You is such a cold and lonely heart, I'll make you warm again
But it was something different about you though
You didn't ask for no autograph or swarm
All you needed was a hug, we being snug like fingers in the glove
8th grade was the last time a nigga was in love
You know how good it can be if I took you home with me
I know the mood is right, I don't wanna be alone tonight
Come on let's dip shawty, dip, let's dip shawty, dip
Let's dip shawty, dip, let's dip shawty
