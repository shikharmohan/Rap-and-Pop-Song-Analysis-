Dear Mr.Ouija, let 'em know who the boss is
So nigga you wanna get tossed in the river?
Nigga, put 'em in the mud see them pump blood, nigga no love
Me show 'em the Bone when I grab that chrome
Gotta haunt that dome
Folla me roll stroll down East 1999
Gotta find these row hoes
Nigga if you woke up and all of a sudden
Nigga you was off inna my hood
I'm a, real thuggish nigga
So a, I would have to kill ya so die
Popped off to the coffin
Pick up my pump dump chumps in the gutter pain
Nigga got ta fucked up bang
Taking no shorts so fuck ya man
Claim my thang to slang them bloody bodies
Kill 'em all, send them hoes up in flames
Krayzie insane to the brain
Hey, we slay niggas who think we play
Nigga, me deadly wid the gun
Machete be dipped in rum
Runnin' wid the gun steady buckin'
Leavin' them bodies dumped off in the alley for dead
I'm near, kill 'em all, mo' murda, mo' murda
That's what Ouija said
Gotta put one in ya head, bang
We coming to serve ya
Mo murda, mo murda, mo murda
Mo murda, mo murda, mo murda
Mo murda mo murda
Come come again
Mo murda mo murda
Come come again
Mo murda mo murda

Will I die of murda bloody mo murda
Living in the Land of the Heartless comin' up daily
Until a me murda them all, I'm never gon' fall
So I'ma murda them baby, get 'em up wid me thugs
See 'em on the corner and they slangin' them drugs
Givin' up shots out to the glock, glock
Eighty eight to the ten five
Them killas be pumpin' them slugs
Niggas be fiendin' me daily
Me silence me twelve guage eruption
And Ic
