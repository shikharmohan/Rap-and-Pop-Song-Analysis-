The Souljahs marching on prepared for war
The cycle continues look what I've been through
Chapter 5 from the book of thugs, 1999, 2000
New millennium marching forward
All aboard seek and destroy any nigga that throw a decoy
We them niggas you can't avoid
Boy, boy, don't fuck around and get me paranoid
I'm on a mission impossible, off da rip when he get hostile
If you gots ta know I got lots of dough
So the murda mo ain't no optional
Unstoppable relentless rolling in Benz's
Hear it repeat weeded indeed nigga believe it
Proceed wid the lead and completed it's on
Feel my bombs motherfucker, undisputed round for round
Putting it down, town ta town tearing da roof of this mother fucker
When I'm in your city get wit' me fuck wit' your nigga
When I'm in Maui hoes around me still come fuck wid your niggas
But if you ain't talking about no money
Nigga, you really ain't talking no sense
Out of line wid out a dime,
Motherfucker, you got me ready
It ain't no honor amongst thieves
Won't waste my time smoking weed
Wid all these petty conversations
So I avoid the playa nation
The Souljahs marching on prepared for war
The Souljahs marching on prepared for war
Still, got the gun on Frankie Sosa
Fully automatic four mathematics original souljahs
See nobody can't stop me betta watch me back out
Woke up in the county as soon as I passed out
Bullet passed the pigs mo murda mo money let's mash out
Mo and mo cash for everyone in the room
Every homie know we move you know the scope is on
Come in and snooze who feeling my music true dat
'Cause if I was in there
I woulda been looting like the rest ah y'all knew dat
(Bone Thug)
Know we knew that in your conscience
You ain't nuthing but a mobster, you can't be budged
God only can judge you
(Thug Luv)
Loot all the cops erase the judge
Heading for the fifth dimension mention
Then settle some stuff legal all I really wanted was a Regal
The Souljahs marching on prepared for war
The Souljahs marching on prepared for war
Now who gonna be the last two soldiers standing
Doing back ta back holding the cannons
Another episode of my bloodish on hit wid ah low blow
Just a thugging ass nigga that's ready ta get some sense
I sorta like Billy The Kid mixed like a leather show no mercy
Filthy gonna kick in explicit some material too deadly
So prepare the description advisory
If you rise get ready fuck wid me steady
Everyday all day daily haters wanna come try fade me
Unleash the guage release bush
Trying ta feel it the wrath of the whirlwind
Swear you'll wake up fast motherfucker
Before the fifth dog holla missile off
And blast you between your eyes serving no homicide
Victim is blown right, all we know she got decapitated
Nigga, your body rot in the crypt
We taping it up to the ceiling graded
Time from time and again my niggas had ta warn
All you enemies of mine I'm coming ta storm
My niggas be storming through wid army and fatigues
Feel the grief artillery nigga them prophets
To the apostle living a revelation set off the revolution
Nigga, the desperado, you niggas can't fuck wid the fifth dog killer
Now haters die, die, die, die
The Souljahs marching on prepared for war
The Souljahs marching on prepared for war
The Souljahs marching on prepared for war
