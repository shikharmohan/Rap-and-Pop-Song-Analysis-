Lil Wayne - Verse 1]
Skinny ass pants
fresh pair of vans
if you n-ggas keep trippin' n-gga share an ambulance
throw up blood with my hands
my gang poppin' n-ggas smoke that kush and not that reggie
for you name droppin' n-ggas
all day I do it
I do it like Tony
got a sign on my d-ck that say "bad bitches only"
I don't drink champagne, it make my stomach hurt
man I'm on that patron, f-ck with me wrong and get murked
got a silencer on the gun, that bitch go "pu"
Got a mean ass swagger, my bitches do too
yeah all my n-ggas nuts and I'm a loose screw
b-tch I get big bucks pockets on bruce bruce
yeah I talk that sh-t bitch I got red, bitch I got toast
welcome to the murder show I am the muthf-cking host
they call me Weezy F Baby yes I do the f-cking most
Im at their throats until they choke
the God has spoke I need a smoke man
[Chorus]
All these bitches and niggas still hatin'
I used to be a baller but now I'm Bill Gaten'
got a list full of problems, I tend to em later
yeah life is a bitch but I appreciate her man(x2)
[Lil Wayne - Verse 1]
It go dark ass shades, I can't see them haters
now eat these f-ckin bullets, don't forget to tip the waiter
dress like a skater, ride on you like Shawn White
I'm high all day, you can call that sh-t a long flight
every nights a long night, every day is a holiday
I can f-ck the squares now do that mean I'm out of shape
yes I talk sh-t, got to defecate to conversate
weezy f-ck the world, yup I f-ck it till it ovulate,
get her to the crib get in that p-ssy just dominate
Weezy F baby and the F is for fornicate
Polo Ralph Lauren bitch, yeah that's what my pajamas say
big tall glass of some sh-t you can't pronounciate
Beaucoup in the bezel of my watch with the diamond face
still I do not give you mother fuckers the time of day
pistol in your mouth I cannot make out what you tryna say
and if they want a war, tell them mother f-ckers bombs away
[Chorus]
All these bitches and niggas still hatin'
I used to be a baller but now I'm Bill Gaten'
got a list full of problems, I tend to em later
yeah life is a bitch but I appreciate em man(x2)
[Lil Wayne]
Let it breath to em,
yes just let it breath to em
Young mula baby
Young mula baby
[End]
