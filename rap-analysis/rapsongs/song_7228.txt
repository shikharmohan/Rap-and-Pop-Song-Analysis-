T.I, you don't know me
I'ma tell y'all sucka ass niggaz somethin'
First of all nigga
Look'a hear dawg
You mighta seen me in the streets

But you don't know me
You be hatin' and I see why
'Cause you don't know me
I think it's time I made a song for niggaz who don't know me
I graduated at the streets, I'ma real OG
I been trappin', shootin' pistols since I stood four feet
So all you niggaz actin' bad, you gonna have to show me
You gonna make me bring this chevy to a real slow creep
My niggaz hangin' out the window, mouth fulla gold teeth
When the guns start poppin' wonder when it's gone cease
Choppa hit you in the side and create a slow leak
We can end the speculation 'cuz today we gon' see
What's the future of a pussy nigga hatin' on me
I give a fuck about the fed's investigation on me
I don't care that they at my shows and they waitin' on me
I'ma keep on flossin', poppin' long as toomp is on the beat
Tell police's I ain't stoppin', I'ma keep it in the streets
Contrary to yo beliefs, I'm as real as you can be
Fuck ya thoughts and ya feelings, nigga you don't know me
You mighta seen me in the streets
But nigga you don't know me

Hey once again let me remind you nigga you don't know me
So don't be walkin' up and askin' what's the deal ona Ki
I don't know if you wearin wires you could be the police
If I was slangin' dope you couldn't get an OZ
See me at the PSC follow thru and tha show deep
Hommies holdin' up the doe 'cuz they know we toat heat
I just wanna wrap a C, blow a dro in a flee
Only playin' 'bout a dozen different bitches in a week
I just wanna chill with country and his daddy Freddy G
Ballin' out everytime, every stone is but a G
Wanna ball in the Bahamas curtousy at KT
Fact I only gotta Mill as well as a dolla DP
Ak house on the hill right next to JG
Everyweek be there for lunch, busta blunt and eat free
Get in day paid Lil Craig dead meat
That's the only shot we got at gettin' cap back on the streets
You mighta seen me in the streets
But nigga you don't know me
When you holla when you speak
Remember you don't know me
Save all the hatin' and the poppin'
