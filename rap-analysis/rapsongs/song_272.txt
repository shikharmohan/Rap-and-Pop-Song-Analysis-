Africa's inside me, taking back her child
She's giving me my pride and setting me free
Africa's inside me, taking back her child
She's giving me my pride and setting me free
Universal, as I stroll down my street
Africas's a bolling over flowing inside of me
I used to sport a curl made by Jerry, a Jerry curl
But as time passed it didn't last, after my curl I never combed my doo
I used to sport a cap but the naps kept shining through, shining
My sister got a brand new perm
My boys say she looks pretty fine body real firm
Folds at her job loves her new touch up
I can tell her white boss gets a kick when she's all done up
My sister loves her blackness
But the U.S. said that the perm is the attractiveness
But Africa keeps coming stronger, we found out
It ain't a perm, it's a temporary
Africa's inside me taking back her child
She's giving me my pride and setting me free
Africa's inside me taking back her child
She's giving me my pride and setting me free
