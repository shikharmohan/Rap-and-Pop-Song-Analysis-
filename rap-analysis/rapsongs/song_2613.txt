Turn your negative into a positive
This one is for the kids
Hmm
People hear me when I talk to yea
(As I grow)
People try to break me but I
(Still stand strong)
'Cuz this life that I live it's
(On my own)
And can nobody can take me off this
(Path I travel on)
People hear me when I talk to yea
Yo
I'm in a position to help a lot of people
When I love it, but people that claim that they love me
Want to take advantage of it
I duck 'em, I can't lie that toss a lot of lies
Can't trust the story tears swellin' in my eyes
Let my pen stab the page, times I feel raged
Sometimes I feel trapped got me locked in a cage
But I break free
Won't never let the anger overtake me
'Cuz actions of another never make 'e or break 'e
  (Hum)
I never let 'em shake me
And no matter what I always wish excessive thos' who hate me
The ones they call my enemies
Who only will be wanna be friends of me
On the other hand surrounded by the greatest team
Who wouldn't trade mind for nothin' not for anything
  (Hum)
Thank you for giving me your bless
And I appreciate giving you everything and nothing less
(As I grow)
People try to break me but I
(Still stand strong)
'Cuz this life that I live it's
(On my own)
And can nobody can take me off this
(Path I travel on)
People hear me when I talk to yea
I live my life through what's in my chest
My heart beat strong, sometimes contaminated by the pest
And yea I know I'm livin' blessed
And if I didn't make it here, my life would be a mess
Can't live a life of fear
All that get you is nowhere surrounded by a bunch of stress
And I always had a hard head
Had a choice to play around wit life or listen to a gossip
So I straightened up and I'm doin' right
Growin' every year, hey yo' this thing ain't happen' overnight
But I still got a lot to do
And never givin' up 'cuz anything I feel I know is possible
Don't never let people discourage
Plant yo'll see the dream, baby and let 'em flourish
Lettin' you in on what I know
Hum, as I live my life an' as I grow
(As I grow)
People try to break me but I
(Still stand strong)
'Cuz this life that I live it's
(On my own)
And can nobody can take me off this
(Path I travel on)
People hear me when I talk to yea
(As I grow)

(Still stand strong)
'Cuz this life that I live it's

{All I want to live life is
We love you Eve}
