Woo, yeah, yeah
Excuse me, is that candy paint?
Them Bone Boys is back
Cleveland, the Full Surface
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin'
Hey, keep rollin', rollin', rollin'
Hey, keep rollin', rollin', rollin'
Hey, keep rollin', rollin', rollin'
What you say now?
I love you
My Impala sittin' on them two fours
I love you
My Cutlass with them suicide doors
Move out my way, move out
*** move out my way, move out my way
Wait a minute now, hold a second now
Wait a minute now, ride on 'em, ride on 'em
Here come grandaddy always classin', ain't no *** badda than that
They know I'm gangsta, 20k 4's on my black Cadillac
And as a matter of fact, flipped it and dipped it in some candy paint
Suckas get mad 'cause they can't bang
Your boy, Lil' Layzie comin' through all in that black Monte Carlo
I'm swtichin' lanes, givin' lanes like it ain't no tomorrow
I'ma tryna get around cars with no regards for this traffic
Look how I yank it, yeah, I yank it makin' it look like it's magic
If you see that dash drop ya know what to do
Ya know what to do, ya know what to do
We was fittin' to roll not gon' let me roll, I've got it, now we don't
Watchin' for them po-po's mashin' down that 71
I love you
My Impala sittin' on them two fours
I love you
My Cutlass with them suicide doors
Move out my way, move out
*** move out my way, move out my way
Wait a minute now, hold a second now
Wait a minute now, ride on 'em, ride on 'em
Stomp it, bash it with my 350 rocket, Cutlass
White on white, it's tight from bumper to bumper, can't touch this
For a little more juice, I supercharged it
Yeah, his ride's tight but ain't tight like mine
'Cause we workin' on different [Incomprehensible]
I swing my doors open
My *** out in Cleveland swing them doors open
Big bumps, big bumps, big trunks
Try to let off, take it to the other side
Let's get high, pimpin' while I'm deep into my vibe, roll by
I'ma come with the cleanest
I ain't gon' be seen with these *** don't know who the team is
I love that I breath with Swizz and Bone *** that's who we is
Whatever the purpose, it's Full Surface, what chu call architects
Too hard to check and if you don't move we startin' ***
I love you
My Impala sittin' on them two fours
I love you
My Cutlass with them suicide doors
Move out my way, move out
*** move out my way, move out my way
Wait a minute now, hold a second now
Wait a minute now, ride on 'em, ride on 'em
Gotta have it *** my weapon is automatic ***
*** stepped his game up when he came up
Should have thought about it
'Cause these 24 inches spinnin'
Is usually good for makin' they heads twirl
Just try to be *** when I journey this world
Switchin' lanes, pimpin', switchin' lanes, pimpin'
Switchin' lanes, pimpin', switchin' lanes
We rollin' through your hood like Bone Thug
And I doubt if we ever need a gang bang it's because
I love you
My Impala sittin' on them two fours
I love you
My Cutlass with them suicide doors
Move out my way, move out
*** move out my way, move out my way
Wait a minute now, hold a second now
Wait a minute now, ride on 'em, ride on 'em
