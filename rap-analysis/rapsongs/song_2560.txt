Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows my story
Went from dancing on tabletops to making labels pop
For the love of the money so I could cock
Everything from icy rings to drop tops and now I'm on top
But to look back on my reality happy I stopped
Letting niggas ruin my world
Impressed by niggas trying to school this baby girl
I was fucking too early, 15 knowing money was green
Puffing too early, body big, not grown knowledged up and too early
Thought it was cute to flirt with older kats up in they face
Didn't have a daddy so I put a daddy in his face
My mami was my shelter but I broke free
Learning that the streets was harder that I thought they'd be
Wanting to be grown, rebelling
Ain't no telling what I'd be pussy selling huh never would I
Instead I wore a g-string thought never could I
Thought I had to, to be grown beginning of my life
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Yo, close myself down held myself in
Explode by myself alone no one helping
What am I to do but cry alone at night
No one in the house nude TV was my life
Who was I to tell and what would they think of me?
No one understood the pain that was sent to me
Broke down from the things men would say to me
Selling drinks to a naive kid I blame me
But I never really had someone tell me what to do
Teach me that I'm better than just pussy that's true
Teach me that the future was written already waiting
To respect my self in life not to be someone would hate me
Do positive and positive will happen
Stay positive and positive was rapping
It was like my brain was clouded with unnecessary shit
When I chose to see through the negative and make hits uh
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Uh, uh, yo, yo
Now I'm 20 years old and look where I'm at
I thank the Lord every night and pray there's no turning back
I wanna keep my family happy and that's that
Seen teens in my mother's eyes from platinum plaques
See things I've done I don't regret I just learn
From mistakes in the past knowing now I had to earn respect
And earn trust some about school was never givin'
The way you find out what life's about is simply living to be strong
Stay strong let nobody crush you your body is your temple young girls
Don't let him touch you
He'll respect anything you say if he really loves you
Don't settle for second let him put no one above you
I did a lot of things in my life
I take back gotta take from the good and the bad collect that
'Cause it help the bill who you see now respect that
Young, black and strong keep me in ya take that
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
