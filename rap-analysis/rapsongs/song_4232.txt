[Intro - Nicki Minaj]
Better strap up your boots
Before they start to shoot
Let's do it for the troops
It's Young Money salute
It's Young Money salute
[Verse 1 - Lil Twist]
Yeah, uh
So sick wit' the flow
Yeah ya cowboys know that Lil Twist
Been a pro way before Romo no T.O.
No wettin' Cowboys to a Piston
A.I. no Wallace, your kids gettin' demolished
I'm bookin' on your suckers like I'm just leavin' college
But smart, very smart, too smart for ya knowledge
Too smart once more, Wayne called me a genius
It's YME nothin' gets in between us
[Verse 2 - Lil Chuckee]
Tell Wayne I'm goin' in like somebody 'bout to bury me
In this rap game nobody could ever bury me
That's why you see me on stage rockin' wit' Young Money
I told my team I got us man it's all on me
Like volume two B.G. I got my crew wit' me
Twist, Mack, Millz, Gudda and my baby Nicki
Everytime I'm on the track it's ransom
Can't find 'em like us anymore, it's random
When Young Money come through you better salute us
[Chorus - Nicki Minaj]
Better strap up your boots
Before they start to shoot
Let's do it for the troops
It's Young Money salute
It's Young Money salute
It's Young Money salute
It's Young Money salute
It's Young Money salute
The salute
The salute
[Verse 3 - Jae Millz]
Hey, I solomly swear if it ever go down
You ain't never gotta call me 'cause I'ma be there
Let's get to the point like elbows, my crew harder than Shell Toes
Strapped like Velcro and this we runnin' hell no
And truthfully, aimin' for number one oh do we
You ask why I reply 'cause nobody remember two or three
Cross YM and the hem will make a movie
We all that we can be, respect the army and salute we
[Verse 4 - Gudda Gudda]
Yeah, Young Money army we marchin'
We coming forward no warnin'
We got these boys runnin' like Forest
So salute me like a general
First place never last
Always on top and I'm a chief like a Seminole
Got the game in a strangle hold no lettin' up
You can get the top, ya can pop like 7 Up
Knock knock let us up, Young Money applaud me
And we'll take the game out your hands like a joystick
[Verse 5 - Nicki Minaj]
I'ma need my badges and my ribbons
Maybe it will make up for everything that I wasn't given
Everything that I've given, I swear I'll never give in
Just look at what I've been in and this is just the beginning
I d-d-d-d-do it 'cause I did it for my ballerina girls
Blowin' kisses to the soldiers I am Marilyn Monroe
But we shoot shoot shoot 'em up, camoflauge me,
Cuz Young Money is the Navy better yet the Army
[Chorus]
[Verse 6 - Lil Wayne]
Commander in chief
One hand on the world, one hand on the brief'
I stand on the world, bitch I stand on the peak
Of the game, and the girls, and the guap, now that's G
Don't ask me about shit but money
Fuckin' right my money long I got that 10 foot money
I get it fast when I get to the money
When I walk, it sound like 10 foots runnin'
I meant feet, I'm in deep like wet pussy
I'm a purple heart proven war vet' rookie
You can't even sit next to me
Now bring money or death to me, or don't step to me
Now don't step nigga, march wit' me
To the steps of the court building
Like ain't we God's children?
I know at all times gods feel me
So I play my part until the war kill me
[Chorus]
