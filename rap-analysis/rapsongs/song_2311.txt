Dedicated and by most suckas, hated

Niggaz ain't shit in the 90's I don't trust 'em
And bitches on my dick but they ain't shit so mutha fuck 'em

'Cuz it don't concern me if don't pertain to money or a nut
But then again I talk to a few of my friends
Nine times outta ten 'bout some endz or some skinz
'Cuz I'm tha type of nigga that gotta have it like a rabbit
Rappn' is my hustle, bustn ho's is a habbit
