Until, the philosophy
Which old one race superior and another
Inferior
Is finally
And permanently
Discredited
And abandoned
Everywhere is war
Me say war
That until there no longer
  (War)
First class and second class citizens
  (War)
Of any nation
  (War)
Until the color of a man's skin
  (War)
Is of no more significance
  (War)
Than the color of his eyes
  (War)
Me say war
  (War)
That until the basic human rights
  (War)
Are equally guarantee to all
  (War)
Without regard to race
  (War)
And this a war
  (War)
That until that day
  (War)
The dream of lasting peace
  (War)
World citizenship
  (War)
Rule of international
  (War)
Morality
  (War)
Will remain in but a fleeting illusion
  (War)
To be pursued
  (War)
But never attained
  (War)
Now everywhere is war
War
And until the ignoble
  (War)
And unhappy regime
  (War)
That hold our brothers in Angola
  (War)
In Mozambique
  (War)
South Africa
  (War)
About human bondage
  (War)
I have been toppled
  (War)
Utterly destroyed
  (War)
Well everywhere is war
Me say war
War in a east
  (War)
War in a west
  (War)
War up north
  (War)
War down south
  (War)
War, war
Rumors have a war
  (War)
And until that day
  (War)
The African Continent
  (War)
Will not know peace
  (War)
We Africans will fight
  (War)
We find it necessary
  (War)
And we know we shall win
  (War)
As we are confident
  (War)
In the victory
  (War)
Of good over evil
  (War)
Of good over evil, yea
  (War)
Good over evil
  (War)
Of good over evil, yea
  (War)
Good over evil
  (War)
(War)
(War)
