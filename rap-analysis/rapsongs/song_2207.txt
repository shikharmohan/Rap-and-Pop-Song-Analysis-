Show them how to break they ankles, mayne
Yeah, E-40 and Shawty Lo
Hey, let's go
From the West Coast to Atlanta
If a nigga gonna hate, well, got damn 'em
Hey, gonna break ya ankles
Hit the dance floor
Gonna break ya ankles
Go stupid, get retarded
  (Dumb, dumb)
Wake the game up, them boys made it
  (Dumb, dumb)
Hey, gonna break ya ankles
We be the shit out of me
Gonna break ya ankles
This a boy, this thang slap
I brought the whole hood with me, brought the whole trap
Mama, this your song, you know the lyrics
Gonna break ya ankles, yeah, that's the spirit
Go nutty, go bananas, go berserk
Show them how to do it, let me see your foot work
We runnin' up a tab, havin' money so we spend it
Bottles everywhere, celebrating like we won the pennant
You recognize the fixture, you see the brightling watch
You get the big picture, you know that I'm a boss
I'mma show up, I'mma show out
From the West Coast to the dirty south
Hey, let's go
From the West Coast to Atlanta
If a nigga gonna hate, well, got damn 'em
Hey, gonna break ya ankles
Hit the dance floor
Gonna break ya ankles
Go stupid, get retarded
  (Dumb, dumb)
Wake the game up, them boys made it
  (Dumb, dumb)
Hey, gonna break ya ankles
We be the shit out of me
Gonna break ya ankles
Fresh off tour, I brought a mil with me
Now the whole club gonna have to deal with me
Like 3-6, tear the club up
Like Pac-Man 'cause I don't give a fuck
I'm throwing big bucks, cash everywhere
Shawty over here, 40 over there
You know the broads out 'cause the stars out
You see the parking lot, we brought the cars out
We going stupid, get retarded
And we ain't playin' with 'em, we came to party
I brought a lot of doe, I'm steadin' throwin' singles
So hit the dance floor, so gonna break ya ankles
From the West Coast to Atlanta
If a nigga gonna hate, well, got damn 'em
Hey, gonna break ya ankles
Hit the dance floor
Gonna break ya ankles
Go stupid, get retarded
  (Dumb, dumb)
Wake the game up, them boys made it
  (Dumb, dumb)
Hey, gonna break ya ankles
We be the shit out of me
Gonna break ya ankles
Do it like this, do it like that
Do it like this, then you do it like that
Break it on down, show 'em how to clown
Mean mug with it, let me see you rep your town
All street money, bonafide trapper
Never seen a check, ballin' like a rapper
80 on the arm, a hundred on my neck
Shoe game sick, in The Bay we call it wet
More jury than the court room, glowin' like the moon
More jury than the court room, I'mma tycoon
Designer everything, throw it in the bag
I don't know how much it costs, I don't look at price tags
From the West Coast to Atlanta
If a nigga gonna hate, well, got damn 'em
Hey, gonna break ya ankles
Hit the dance floor
Gonna break ya ankles
Go stupid, get retarded
  (Dumb, dumb)
Wake the game up, them boys made it
  (Dumb, dumb)
Hey, gonna break ya ankles
We be the shit out of me
Gonna break ya ankles
