[Verse 1 - Pharrell]
You can catch me riding down on a fuckin berrazano
Ass out just like diallo diablo
Hi hoe silver call that motherfucker Tonto
Leave a smoke trail back in Jersey in my condo
You can run up like you're Rambo
But you better hit me nigga if you know what I know
Cuz I got some supersize guys that'll hit you with a combo
Pronto
You won't see the morning like alonzo
[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]
Camo shorts no socks with the red bapes
Walk in to my closet fuck around an get a headache
Fuck you so good shawty you gon need a bed break
Red viper slither through the street like a red snake
Red diamonds in my chain lookin like a red snake
Fuck with me wrong man you gon need some yellow tape
All them awards Wayne do you need a metal case?
(Yes... yes... yes... yes... yes)
[Chorus - Pharrell]
You got that mean mug grill, that red in ya eyes
That ace of spades baby talkin big boy size
Get a stack in each hand, and hold it like ya fresh
They say man its like that? Say yes nigga yes nigga yes
Ya money and ya girls, chillin in the VIP
Stop for a second and gyrate them hips
Get a stack in each hand
And hold it like ya fresh
If they say man its like that? Say yes nigga yes nigga yes
[Verse 3 - Lil Wayne]
Yes I make money I'm a paper machine
And you can catch me in the newest not the latest machine
Now Weezy why you drive so fast? because I'm chasin' the dream
And when I catch that motherfucker I'ma rape it and leave
Yea

(Yes... yes... yes... yes... yes)
Ride by myself in that all red enzo
Smoke make it look like I got tinted windows
Young Money bitch but for short its Y M hoe

All my niggas scarin ya

Scarier than a cat in a cage with a terrier
Pet cemetary Wayne
Are you the veterinarian?
(Yes... yes... yes... yes... yes)
[Chorus - Pharrell]
You got that mean mug grill, that red in ya eyes
That ace of spades baby talkin big boy size
Get a stack in each hand, and hold it like ya fresh
They say man its like that? Say yes nigga yes nigga yes
Ya money and ya girls, chillin in the VIP
Stop for a second and gyrate them hips
Get a stack in each hand
And hold it like ya fresh
If they say man its like that? Say yes nigga yes nigga yes
[Verse 4 - Lil Wayne]
Yes I do it big
Call me little astronomical
Weezy F Baby and the F is for phenomenal
Type of nigga go and get his hood cross his abdominal
You could check my watch I been rich a long time ago
I'm so tired of ballin man I sleep all night
Bed sheets so nice bed bugs dont bite
I ask her do she wanna fuck before I ask twice she say
(Yes... yes... yes... yes... yes)
Yes I am a beast I swear I needs to be tranquilized
Yes I am a giant next to me you are just ankle high
Yes I eat that pussy oh how do I love that panty pie
Keep my hair shampooed and yes I keep my hands sanitized
New Orleans baller ask ESPN
Just kickin it with the Bruce Lee-esbian
Do you really think you're better than the rest?
(Yes... yes... yes... yes... yes)
Bitch I'm the best
[Chorus - Pharrell]
You got that mean mug grill, that red in ya eyes
That ace of spades baby talkin big boy size
Get a stack in each hand, and hold it like ya fresh
They say man its like that? Say yes nigga yes nigga yes
Ya money and ya girls, chillin in the VIP
Stop for a second and gyrate them hips
Get a stack in each hand
And hold it like ya fresh
If they say man its like that? Say yes nigga yes nigga yes
