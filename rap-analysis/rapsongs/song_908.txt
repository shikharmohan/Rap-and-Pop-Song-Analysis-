Huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh
Huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh
Huh huh huh, huh huh woo
Woo
Woo woo woo
Yeah, everybody, c'mon
Here we go party people woo
Pull up in the whip, pop the trunk, feel it?
Fear for the will of baboon funk, ya hear it?
Me and my nigga Richie was itchy to meet some women
Met some chickens, they was actin' so snobby and bitchy, fuck it
Pass me the sticky
The chicky wanted to leave me with a kiss and a hickie
I ain't wit it but give me a quicky
I ain't in to doin' the licky-licky
Even though you be lookin' so pretty
I own all of my shit, never 50-50
Oodle noodles all those fools never refuse
Accuse me for the bruise
Chick outta rattle and sound, better tighten the screws
Runnin' and gunnin', kinda stunnin'
The way we be comin' around, slummin', wylin' and dollin'
My nigga Horace kick up a nigga like Chuck Norris
Got some other niggas lost way up in the forest
Hang you up in a harness, label me and all of my niggas the hardest
Fuck around, be the next "Formerly Known As" artist
Layed out with a goddess, pretty Lilly Adonis
Besides all of that, niggas is 'nomous, I make you all a promise
The promise is that I'm so dominant and that I am so prominent
Captured the whole of Asia as a continent
Oh shit, I be comin' and tumblin' down
Rumblin', stumblin' down
Freaky prophet with usual musical sound
Bringin' the ruckus, you motherfuckers be givin' me pounds
So many sound, give me the camcorder and a city with plans
Me and my fam, hustle and tussle in makin' this groove
Me and my mans
How we gon' do this?
(Make them move)
Keepin' it live
(Where my niggas is at?)
Stackin' my paper
(Put it away safe)
Straight buckwild, let me see your hands
What we gon' do?
(Do it to death)
What we gon' do?
(We gon' do it to death)
What we gon' do?
(Do it to death)
What we gon' do?
(Do it to death)
Yo! Pin or a needle, make you wobble or weeble
Niggas is feeble, back in the day I used to get money illegal
Get some ass, cop a room down at the Regal
Hit you wit so much drama make niggas always wait for the sequel
Yo, there ain't no equal on how we be reppin' for the people
Yo, there really ain't no equal
Ask Hillary, met her down on Flatbush and Tillory
She killin' me, got me crazy, wylin', actin' straight grizzly
We never made it too far together
I left her standin' on Franklin and Willoughby
Another mystery to me
While she still on the corner kissin' at me, hissin' at me
Ignorin' these bitches, they're angry, now they're riffin' at me
Vital and critical, literal, lyrical, make niggas pitiful
Go to the clinical, examine your physical
Frightening and enlightening at the same time
Get the goods and price them, and doin' the heist again
You thinkin' we would be nice again
We on a mission, we don't need none of your advice again
Hold me down baby, Pitter Patter, you chitter chatter too much
I'm a splitter splatter your blidder bladder
Make you spill out your guts
How we gon' do this?
(Make them move)
Keepin' it live
(Where my niggas is at?)
Stackin' my paper
(Put it away safe)
Straight buckwild, let me see your hands
What we gon' do?
(Do it to death)
What we gon' do?
(We gon' do it to death)
What we gon' do?
(Do it to death)
What we gon' do?
(Do it to death)
Flip Mode Squad, Hell yeah
How we gon' do?
(We gon' do it to death)
Flip Mode Squad, Hell yeah
How we gon' do?

How we gon' do?
(We gon' do it to death)
Aiyo, how we gon' do?
