C'mon and you don't stop
And you don't stop
And you don't stop
I was launched off the block, straight to the top
To yachts with helicopters, I'm so hot
Paparazzi, blinded by the rocks
My limousine roll up, the whole world shocked 'cause
You steppin' out with an entrepreneur
I copped you more than what you bargained for
Roll the red carpet, enjoy the profits
First let's make love in the walk-in closet
Daddy just made a nine digit deposit
Believe me sweetie it's not luck, it's logic
I'm the captain of my destiny
Used to dream of the things I was blessed to see
The jewels and the papers, sports cars and such
There's nothing in the world LL can't touch
You stood by my side and pushed me so much
That's why you got them 10 karats, you know what?
It's so amazing, amazing, amazing
Life's given my baby, my baby, my baby
Maybe some day you'll feel, how I feel, it's crazy
To see my baby is so amazing
Sing it baby
I've got riches wall to wall
Up the stairs and down the hall of
All the things that we have done
You got more ideas for us to
Live our lives and explore
There is no topping you, you're untoppable
It's so amazing, amazing, amazing
Life's given my baby, my baby, my baby
Maybe some day you'll feel, how I feel, it's crazy
To see my baby is so amazing
It's so amazing, your love to me
It's so amazing, amazing to me
It's so amazing, your love to me
It's so amazing, amazing to me
It's alright
Sometimes you work late at night
Just as long, as you don't defy my love then it's on
Slide out to Venice, my game's in order
Would chip in to vent but the city's on water
Searchlights and fireworks bling the sky
A vowel on the end of everything we buy
Yellow ice in both ears, I loosen up the tie
I'm lovin' this lifestyle, baby I can't lie
It feels so good it make a grown man cry
'Cause I made it out the hood and a lot of my crew died
I guess I had determination
And baby girl kept me in the congregation
Now it's private jets and deep conversation
Hundred G's a month to show appreciation
All eyes on us, the cameras flash
In God we trust, I don't love this cash
But you was definitely, by my side when my world collapsed
Now I'm rich for life and I'm payin' you back
It's so amazing, your love to me
It's so amazing, amazing to me
It's so amazing, your love to me
It's so amazing, amazing to me
It's so amazing, amazing, amazing
Life's given my baby, my baby, my baby
Maybe some day you'll feel, how I feel, it's crazy
To see my baby is so amazing
It's so amazing to me
