Man, I can sell anything, mane
I got the mouth piece of a pimp, man
Who want it, who want it?
I can sell it, I can sell it
Who need it, who need it?
I can sell it, I can sell it
I got a gold mouthpiece
I can sell it, I can sell it
Holla at me in the streets
I can sell it
I can sell a flat tire to a bike
A left to a right, a root beet to a sprite
A dick to a dyke, a mute to a mike
Wind to a kite, dark to bright, a shadow to a light
Cheese to pizza, slut to a diva
Stripes to a zebra, spots to a cheetah
Tall can to a liter, sell sound to a speaker
A bucket to a Beemer, a scam to a schemer
Sell love to hate, the truth to lies
Sell real to fake, sell shit to flies
Sell gas to Texaco, insurance to Geico
Tank full of petro, minutes to metro
Hill billy like Jethro, magazines [Incomprehensible]
Screaming that eastside, straight up out the valley yo
It's Sick Wid It, in case you suckas didn't know
I can sell snow to a ski slope
Who want it, who want it?
I can sell it, I can sell it
Who need it, who need it?
I can sell it, I can sell it
I got a gold mouthpiece
I can sell it, I can sell it
Holla at me in the streets
I can sell it
Who want it, who want it?
I can sell it, I can sell it
Who need it, who need it?
I can sell it, I can sell it
I got a gold mouthpiece
I can sell it, I can sell it
Holla at me in the streets
I can sell it
I can sell mud to a worm, sell a pimp a perm
Knock a bitch on a straight path, sell her a term
Sell fire to a match, ice to a freezer
Sell itch to a scratch, sell credit to a VISA
Sell the club for street weed, zip for zip
And fly to Iraq and sell extra clips
Sell sand to the beach, fuzz to a peach
Get double for each, sell lips to a leach
I can sell Buffy some ass, sell a bum some trash
Sell trees in a forest, sell the yard some grass
Sell the future to the past, a blind man some glasses
Miles to a car, cigar some ashes
Sell wool to a sheep, dead man some sleep
I can sell some best friends some beef, shit
I can sell a shark some teeth
I got a nigga's nigga, y'all can get it from me
Who want it, who want it?
I can sell it, I can sell it
Who need it, who need it?
I can sell it, I can sell it
I got a gold mouthpiece
I can sell it, I can sell it
Holla at me in the streets
I can sell it
Who want it, who want it?
I can sell it, I can sell it
Who need it, who need it?
I can sell it, I can sell it
I got a gold mouthpiece
I can sell it, I can sell it
Holla at me in the streets
I can sell it
I can sell grapes to a vineyard, chicken to the colonel
Keys to a custodian, speed to turbo
Kicks to Beckham, skills to a veteran
Pills to Excedrin, joy to depression
Sell a bar some drinks, a coat to a mink
Sell some thoughts to a thinker, psychologists to a shrink
I can sell weight to a gym, 11 times outta 10
Sell rain to a storm, sell blow to a hard
Look I can sell sugar to a cake, water to a lake
Shoes to a snake, shake to a quake
Wings to a boat, sleeves to a coat
A page to a book, some crimes to a crook
I can sell thin to frail, a shell to a snail
White to pale, off to a scale
Grind to a block, time to a clock
Silent to a rock, detox to a knock
Who want it, who want it?
I can sell it, I can sell it
Who need it, who need it?
I can sell it, I can sell it
I got a gold mouthpiece
I can sell it, I can sell it
Holla at me in the streets
I can sell it
Who want it, who want it?
I can sell it, I can sell it
Who need it, who need it?
I can sell it, I can sell it
I got a gold mouthpiece
I can sell it, I can sell it
Holla at me in the streets
I can sell it
