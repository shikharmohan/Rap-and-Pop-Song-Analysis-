Yo, yo what, listen
Come in the jam and do what, say yo, Listen

What say, what say, what, uh yo listen
Come on everybody, say what, ay yo listen
Put your hand up in the air, ay yo listen
Now we ball out, what ya'll with some pee wee click
It's the biggest nigga you know, eyein' your chick
It must be in your blood 'cause you dyin' to trick
And it must be brand new 'cause it don't even fit
So leave all that vulgarious life to me
'Cause I'm the only cat out here, that's right to be
Laid out on beaches with sand on the back
But my man soon did hand to hand, handlin' tracks
And all of us together on top of the world
We bond when we click like a string full of pearls
Got big dreams and big ammunition
So people all around, ay yo you should listen
Come in the jam and do what, say yo, listen
People come around you need to listen
Clear that shit out your ear and just listen
What, come on nigga, yo come on, listen
What, say what, say what, uh listen
Come on everybody say what, ay yo, listen
Put your hand up in the air, ay yo, listen
Do this shit with flare, ay yo, listen
What you lookin' at, ya'll ain't seen a superstar before?
All up in my grill, since I walked through the door, shh
Ya'll bought tickets when I went out on tour
Now, you tryin' to front like you don't love me no more
That's cool though, see I wanna come to your town
At the next show, watchin' Heavy get down
You duck what the F, don't say that
Ya'll know what I mean, Biggie don't play that
Where your loyalty lie for this fly royalty guy
Do it till I die and I'm lyin' in the sky
Until you well run dry and your thirsty for fly
It's D your goin' to be missin', so take heed and listen
Ay yo, do listen
Everybody all the 'round, ay yo, listen
People in the ghettos and such, ay yo, listen
Yo, yo my heart you touch, ay yo, listen
Put your hands up in the sky and yo, listen
Dance 'cause you know that you fly, ay yo, listen
Heav D burnin' the joint, ay yo, listen
3rd Joint, yo get the point, ay yo, listen
Yo, yo, yo when I leave the whip what ya'll notice first
The dime chick or the crucifix
Lets make it bubble we goin' keep it subtle
My name Dwyer my game tight, believe it ya'll goin' to hear me tonight
And then some, I'm handsome with a diva habit
Competition, I crush them then I brag about it
Exquisite, who is it? Heav D and these ladies got a thing for me
And all these R&B; chicks be wantin' to sing to me
Now fly girls is you with me?
(Hell Yeah)
And all my dogs is ya with me?
(Hell Yeah)
