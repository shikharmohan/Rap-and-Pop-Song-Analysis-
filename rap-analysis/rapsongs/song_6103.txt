"I told you a long time ago you fuckin' little monkey not to fuck me"
"Hey hey, who the fuck you think you going for huh?"
"Who the fuck you think I am, your fuckin' door boy?"
"You wanna go to war? Wanna go to war, okay?"
Comin' up on half a mil, we build
Get real God, taking you on another one son
Uhh, Julio Igleasias
Making cream like that nigga
Yo, first of all son, peep the arson
Many brothers I be sparkin' and bustin' mad light inside the dark
Call me dough snatcher, just the brother for the rapture
I hand glide, holdin' on strong, hard to capture
Extravagant, RZA bake the track and it's militant
Then I react, like a convict, and start killin' shit
It's manifested, the Gods work like appliances
Dealin' in my cypher I revolve around sciences
The 9th chamber, leave you trapped inside my hallway
You try to flee but you got smoked up by the doorway
No question, I send your ass back, right to the essence
Your whole frame is smothered in dirt, now how you restin'
While I'll be trapped by sounds, locked behind loops
Throwin' niggaz off airplanes 'cause cash rules
Everything around me black, as you can see
Swallow this murder one verse like God degree
Then analyze my soundtrack for satisfaction
You adapt like a flashback chain reaction
Just a minute son, AK's black bust back like seventy Macs
I'm all that, street niggaz knowin' my steez black
Ron G, you know he coincide with me see
Marvelous, Menace fo' society
But anyway, let's toast, champagne thoughts with ghost
I max the most shotguns through the nose
Phonograph hip hop put me on top
'Lo wears, and Tommy Hil fly shit with a knot
The witty unpredictable live shit, drive by shit
Do or die shit, I'll take your lie and shit
And then you know, I'm runnin' through the penal, foul
Four toothed child was wild
The old lady snitched, but fuck it, you know it, one love kid
No I'm not doin' a bid
Too much to get for what 'cause six niggaz got
Stuck, and the nigga chain was truck
Yo fuck that, Criminology rap
Speakers stay jet black floatin' in the flyest Ac'
Nigga, bring it, yeah
Much love go to New York City
All my Tommy Hil' ice rockin' niggaz
