I never let you down I'mma shine on sight
Keep your mind on your grind and off of mines, alright?
Hard, I'mma ball on them squares, I flow
Quarter-million dollar cars everywhere I go
I know in the lead it may seem me might be
But no matter what they doing they don't do it like me
Like a G, I hold it down for the town I'm at
In a flash like that, recognize I'm back
Strike a match, catch a fire, any moment I decide
That's enough of all your lies, boy, your buzz just died
Step inside, super fly, to the shoes in they coupe
Then exit out with all the bitches like we always do
My desire to retire grow with every new crew
'Cause these guys just don't ride like my nigga, you too
Tight jeans, funny haircuts, dancing on the screen
It's about the real niggas in the game so it seems
Just pretend to holla pimpin', givin' shit a black eye
Next he say he trapping in my head I'm like why?
Be yourself, you ain't gotta pimp bone in your body
I can tell ya ain't never bought a key or caught a body
Nigga probably just seen Wayne, Gucci Mane, me and Boosie
All go to prison and they flip their whole image nigga trippin'
Listen, do for you, that ain't in the cars
Think the power is in your gun but overall it's in your heart
Nowadays I don't know what's up with niggas in the A
Guess he think he in the game but he really in the way
Violating, I was having conversations in the joint
But guess who done it and I promised I would put you on point
I'm disappointed in you, dog, you ain't hold it down at all
But I ain't going near ya jaw, just gonna show ya how to ball
Standin' tall through the storm on the yard or in the dorm
Cats in prison who expecting me to represent for 'em
I never let you down I'mma shine on sight
Keep your mind on your grind and off of mines, alright?
Hard, I'mma ball on them squares, I flow
Quarter-million dollar cars everywhere I go
I know in the lead it may seem me might be
But no matter what they doing they don't do it like me
Like a G, I hold it down for the town I'm at
In a flash like that, recognize I'm back
Strike a match, catch a fire, CTI, add gas
What's a Molotov cocktail? They never break a glass
Scary-ass nigga, wanna come for me? You better bring it
I ain't mad, I forgive 'em, God I know they ain't mean it
Yeah I seen it all before, hate I'm popping and they ain't
Rack they brain, try to think how to stop it and they can't
Ain't that lame? But then they hatred manifest to pure malice
I'm no longer being careless, I'mma let you niggas have it
Won't be satisfied 'til somebody dies and I'm patient, waiting
Know me and the reaper on a first name basis now
I'mma let you make it now, stay totally out the way for you
But know that we can take it any place you wanna take it to
Hating in your blood, 'cause guess it's just too late for you
All I could do is pray for you or organize a wake for you
Your choice, clearly I ain't hearing your voice
Keep it up and I'mma send your ass to chill with Aunt Joy
Hey, you can the bottom partner I'm up in the sky box
I got shit locked-down, nigga, why stop now?
I'm so above you hover over suckers, why drop down?
I'm so profound it goes down and
I never let you down I'mma shine on sight
Keep your mind on your grind and off of mines, alright?
Hard, I'mma ball on them squares, I flow
Quarter-million dollar cars everywhere I go
I know in the lead it may seem me might be
But no matter what they doing they don't do it like me
Like a G, I hold it down for the town I'm at
In a flash like that, recognize I'm back
