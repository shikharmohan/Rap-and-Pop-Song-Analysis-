Aiyyo, don't go near the speakers
The big showdown, the display is skill
I'm the type of guy, so put your girl on the pill
Take a family snap shot, kiss your wife
'Cause I'm like a knife, the concrete is right
And I'll take your life and take you like python
I'ma do you wrong
Any emcee, who you wanna name?
I want pain that I can be tamed
Talkin' 'bout guns, punk, it don't alarm me
Got enough cash to make a whole damn army
I can't hold back the way that I feel
'Cause when I bust a rhyme it's like you're slippin' off banana peels
You're like fruit cake, your fruit cocktails
First your title now I'm takin' your female
All of a sudden you're so proud of black
A baseball hat but you ain't sayin' Jack
The ripper is back and you can't escape
'Cause one of my records will sell more than your whole tape
I want beef, bring on the rookies
I got more than just Cool J cookies
Rip Rock, crush, stop
Cop, I'm poison come and take a drop
I bet your teeth will end up around the corner, kid
Don't ask me why I did it?
I'm civilized damage to a nobody
And I'm carryin' a gun if I'm rhymin' at the party
New York, Chicago, Detroit, L.A.
I'll slay wherever you play
D.C. or Philly or Baltimore
I'm worryin' the rich, invadin' the poor
Perpetratin' in your video, here's the real smoothin'
Country accents, who do you think you're foolin'?
I play crushable, late night craps
You only knew 'cause you onto your raps
And rap city and V E T
The channel 31 and but now here I come
To save the day and the now you're gettin' done
Like a hooker, don't try to soul, crumb
The first sign of the battle you little fake
It's [Incomprehensible] comin' out your kitchen sink
Your mic's a baby bottle, son
Some say they ain't but I am the one
The slice is that the fire boy, it'll break you
Servin' or heard em a word occurred to him
Then he could move a would get moved on
Like a shotgun blast
Big mouth emcees, I'll bet you none last
'Cause they ain't stable or able
And I boost the party like jumper cables
So plug me in and put me on
I'm serial hard so I can battle a-more
From coast to coast fly, cripple, and crazy
Use a dictionary but you still don't phase me
Listen and we can sound cheap
Reach out for my blackness but you represent wackness
You're bitin' on the castle door
But when you fall in the moat, I won't see you no more
Let's get together and diss LL
Use his name and your records might sell
I can't believe you band of dead maggots
Crawlin' all over my name, I won't have it
You better look in the mirror and re-think your plan
Why walk in quicksand?
When you can stand on your own two feet
I'm rippin' emcees, a funky drum with a big beat
Name the date and a arena
Your three year old ballerina
I can't believe the suckers try to throwdown
Whether you're new or older than motown
Just kick back
I don't like a stagger wagger psycho rap
You can't handle the format
Whether you're swab or swoon
Ruff or rugged, all I need is a broom
If I slay the way they slay, punk, play the pay
Mr. Morris has entered the buffet
Some of y'all are sittin' in rows
Plates of the hot butter rolls
Beat your with boloney, slap you with salami
'Cause when I get hot I get hot like pastrami
Then I make you wonder
Why you don't hear bass but you feel the thunder
You get cooked, I'll knock out your tooth
We'll be fightin' from lobby to the roof
You are on me like I wrote your dinnertime
Yo, Marley, whassup? Spill the time
Nah man, just kick a little warmth
Pass the brass knuckles then we break his jaw
When I'm on the microphone I want silence
Let KRS-One stop the violence
Ain't no rivals, ain't no competition
Punk, I'm beatin' you into submission
I'm gettin' busier than ever before
Never more will I'll slack, I'ma keep it real raw
Eat you up like a pack-jam
Video for poppin' over a Batman
Rippin' you to shreds, tappin' you on the head
Then leave the battle lookin' as happy as a newly wed
Give me a Tech-9 to spray
Save the peep and put it on lay away
I'll make a major main event and send a jam, the fans will understand
Then you weep about the murdergram
