Ohh ohh, ohh
Yeah
Mmm, mmm
If you need me baby I'm for real
The rest of your life, I'll take you to paradise
(Paradise)
If you want it baby just be real
Rest of your life, I'll take you to paradise
I'm gonna give-a-you all my love, yeah
We went through this before
Actin' like the L's can't bag 'em no more
Nightgown draggin' on the heated marble floor
Flash Cartier when you open up the door, slide these on baby
So butter, still relate to the gutter
Just your lifestyle's different, spirit uplifted
Fell in love with a cat who's gifted
Turn you back to paradise, damn I missed it
Pop a bottle, light a purple candle
I got somethin' that you can't quite handle, that's why you love me
Pour bubbly, glow from the flame make your skin shine lovely
I'm sayin' baby
Touch it, why don'tcha?
Touch it, why don'tcha?
Touch it, why don'tcha?
Touch it, why don'tcha?
Hey girl, aw, girl!
Hey girl, I wanna rock your world
If you need me baby I'm for real
  (If you need me baby, yeah)
The rest of your life, I'll take you to paradise
(Paradise, is very nice)
If you want it baby just be real
  (Yeah)
Rest of your life, I'll take you to paradise
I'm gonna give-a-you all my love
(Yeah)
Next phase is this
Black sand, Tahiti, ten days to reminisce
(Yeah)
God's my witness
I paid the price for paradise, so I'm livin this
I never limit myself, the L's fearless
Lay back while I illuminate the darkness
Like it smooth don'tcha
Make it move won'tcha, think I won't?
Take you to your peak I know them other cats don't
And it won't stop, this is beyond paper
First I get your mind right, then I might drape ya
Never pimpin', raise my girls well
Young thoroughbreds get schooled by Uncle L.L.
C-double, L tattooed on the bubble
I lay the mink down, let you walk over a puddle
(Yeah, yeah)
True love is so rare
But don't you worry I ain't goin' nowhere
If you need me baby I'm for real
Rest of your life, I'll take you to paradise, yeah, yeah
  (I'm giving you paradise)
(You know what? Paradise, is very nice)
If you want it baby just be real
  (If you want it baby)
Rest of your life, I'll take you to paradise
I'm gonna give-a-you all my love, yeah
  (I'm gonna give-a-you all my love)
Trust me, trust me, trust me, baby
  (Oh my love)
Rest of your life I'll take you to paradise
  (Oh my love)
I'll take you to paradise, ooh
So won't you try me, try me try, this lady?
Rest of your life I'll take you to paradise
I'm gonna give-a-you all my love, yeah
Belly to belly, one hand on the jelly
At the telly on the celly, get that money Elly
Please believe it, if the mind can conceive it
Then the man can achieve it, you gotta breathe it
And I breathe deep, I'm one with the universe
Minimum, ten percent go to God first
Lay back baby, close your eyes
Ice on the pinky finger froze your thighs
So much shade baby, the water bed fries
Walk around nude in the suite yellin', "Recognize!"
Do your dance, baby pour me a glass
It feels so good to have the world in a smash
Touch it why don'tcha?
Touch it why don'tcha?
Touch it why don'tcha?
Touch it why don'tcha?
Hey girl, aw, girl!
Hey girl, I wanna rock your world
If you need me baby I'm for real
  (If you need me)
The rest of your life, I'll take you to paradise, yeah, yeah
  (Said, "I'm for real")
(Paradise, is very nice)
If you want it baby just be real
  (I'm in here)
Rest of your life, I'll take you to paradise
(I'm in here)

Rest of your life I'll take you to paradise

So won't you try me, try me try, this lady

I'm gonna give-a-you all my love, yeah
(It's high time baby)
(One love, one God, recognize, uhh)

Said, "If you want me, just be for real"
And if you like me, come and talk to me
And if you want me, tell me how you feel
If you need me baby I'm for real
Rest of your life, I'll take you to paradise
(Paradise)
(Paradise, is very nice)
