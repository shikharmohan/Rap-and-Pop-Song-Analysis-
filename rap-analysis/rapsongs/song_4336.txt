God loves you my child,
turn away from your sins.
Repent, repent! it's never too late.
Repent and be faithful to the gospel.
Beware of false prophets and return to 
the all loving, all forgiving God.
Say so long to secular music and welcome 
Jesus into your life.
Save your soul before it is corrupted by the vile lyrics
of this man. Pray for his conversion, 
and the conversion of all sinners.
Can I get an Amen up in here!
