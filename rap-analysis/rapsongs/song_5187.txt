If I'm a dog then we some dogs
We all gonna chase cats, tell 'em dog
Girl don't waste that, swallow it all
We just some dogs, we just some dogs
If I'm a dog then we some dogs
We all gonna chase cats, tell 'em dog
Girl don't waste that, swallow it all
We just some dogs, we just some dogs
By any means necessary, it's on
Bitch, your fucking with a dog
All I wanna do is bury some bones
Take a piss on a tree and I'm gone
Girlfriend don't get it wrong
I hate to be the one to shit on your lawn
But I ain't got my dog license, I ain't nothing nice
And I ain't never met a piece of pussy I ain't liking
Sugar and spicing, kicked up with ice
You can do anything with these hoes except housewife 'em
Like Snoop said "it ain't nothing but a G thing"
Got a bitch in my bed in nothing but a G string,
So peep game, who the lucky female to taste these?
Snips and snails and puppy dog tails, huh?
You're messing with me, I'm messing with you
I'm a dog trick, I chase cats like Peppy La Pu, dead on shit
My life's like a Holiday Inn, if my girl's actin' up
Then I'm gonna fuck her friend, if I'm a what
If I'm a dog then we some dogs
We all gonna chase cats, tell 'em dog
Girl don't waste that, swallow it all
We just some dogs, we just some dogs
If I'm a dog then we some dogs
We all gonna chase cats, tell 'em dog
Girl don't waste that, swallow it all
We just some dogs, we just some dogs
I'm a dog motherfucker, I walk on all fours
Find where you live at, shit on your porch
Redman is hungry, don't leave the food out
I'm pumped like a Pamela Anderson boob job
Straight up bulldog, mixed with a Shitzu
'Cause I bullshit, party a little bit, swim with the sharks
You're bound to drown, my weed is like green and yours brown
The doctor the dog, from Cali to Georgia
When cats meow with nothing on top they halter
I don't have yes men that laugh when I laugh
Remember we all dogs, we can kiss our own ass
Like a golden retriever, retrieving the chronic
The do nose nose bitch, no need to hide it
Redman a flirt, always get my nuts stuck to the porch
Like the dog in Joe Dirt
If I'm a dog then we some dogs
We all gonna chase cats, tell 'em dog
Girl don't waste that, swallow it all
We just some dogs, we just some dogs
If I'm a dog, then we some dogs
We all gonna chase cats, tell 'em dog
Girl don't waste that, swallow it all
We just some dogs, we just some dogs
Fish don't fry in the kitchen
Bitch don't climb, keep bitching
Beans don't burn on the grill
3, 4, 5 with the pimping
Hoes get your pimps permission
Now pay attention
The big D O, double to the G O
To the liquor store to crack a hoe and get some V O
And mix it with some Pena Colidino
Then slip it on the bitch and then I dip with all her C notes
Scandalous? Yep bitch, 'cause we know
Every pretty hoe always down to pull a D low
On me? No, so there won't be no
Shaking me down, breaking me down, here we go
You know I'm just oh so slick
The way you chew that bubble gum
The way you sucking the dick
And I can tell, that you a freak
I wanna stick some dick up in you, can I skeet, skeet?
You know why?
If I'm a dog then we some dogs
We all gonna chase cats, tell 'em dog
Girl don't waste that, swallow it all
We just some dogs, we just some dogs
If I'm a dog then we some dogs
We all gonna chase cats, tell 'em dog
Girl don't waste that, swallow it all
We just some dogs, we just some dogs
If I'm a dog then we some dogs
We all gonna chase cats, tell 'em dog
Girl don't waste that, swallow it all
We just some dogs, we just some dogs
If I'm a dog then we some dogs
We all gonna chase cats, tell 'em dog
Girl don't waste that, swallow it all
We just some dogs, we just some dogs
Ha ha
Suck the dick up your [Incomprehensible] bitch
I'm a dog damn dag an' I'll deny it
I'm a dog till I die
Shit on your lawn
