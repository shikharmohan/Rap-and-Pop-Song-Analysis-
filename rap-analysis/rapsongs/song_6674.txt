Oh, Cali? No doubt
LAX, oh, Cali? No doubt, baby, no doubt
LAX, oh, Cali? No doubt, baby, no doubt
LAX, oh, Cali? No doubt, baby, no doubt
LAX, oh, Cali? No doubt, baby
West, West, y'all, pile it on your plate
A little somethin' somethin' from the Golden State
Nah, we ain't like Kobe and Shaq
It's Magic and Kareem *** showtime is back
True legends, two steppin' on you peasants
What y'all thought? Y'all gon' need 'bout two vests'
'Cause when he plug, I plug
Mixed shot with the slug, listen here, cuzz, when I dig dug
Play slick and get stuck
But don't play tough, boy, go and get it up
Hey yo, Cube, tell me this
Why half of the homies gettin' worked ***
Then they fall in love and get hurt by  ***
Nine months later, cuzz got mirked ***
See I'm just a *** that you don't wanna
Reverse the game on her, put the *** on a corner
Welcome to California
LAX, oh, Cali? No doubt, baby, no doubt
LAX, oh, Cali? No doubt, baby, no doubt
  (Welcome to Cali)
LAX, oh, Cali? No doubt, baby, no doubt
  (Welcome to Cali)
LAX, oh, Cali? No doubt, baby
  (Welcome to Cali)
Come hit the town, drop down ***
LAX, top down ***
I'm scoopin' you up, you rollin' or what?
I know what you came for, I'm rollin' it up
Snoop Dogg *** y'all hold up
Never thought Ice Cube would show up
But I'm in the studio gettin' *** up
With a beat from Battlecat, a *** lucked up
I got my hustle down, look and learn
See how a hot *** cook and burn
A *** earn like David Stern
Mixed with Big Worm when he off that *** now
Bust a U-turn, come by your hood
For motherf*** that think I went Hollywood
Pick a coast, it got to be the west
I live out there, from the W.S., West Side
LAX, oh, Cali? No doubt, baby, no doubt
LAX, oh, Cali? No doubt, baby, no doubt
(Welcome to Cali)
LAX, oh, Cali? No doubt, baby, no doubt
(Welcome to Cali)
LAX, oh, Cali? No doubt, baby
(Welcome to Cali)
Fell asleep on the plane and so did he
Woke up chillin' in the LBC
I grew up in the ***
But that ain't what I turned out to be
Understand me that I'm still a G
Who ain't never spent a day in the penitentiary
Now I'm rappin' with Snoop D O double G
And got the whole *** world *** lovin' me
Yep, yep, they love him to death
'Cause he walk under water without gettin' wet
Roll through the neighborhood without gettin' checked
So gone and so blown, 'Are We There Yet?'
You wonder why I got the 'S' on my chest
'Cause I'm a motherf*** vet from the 'Wild Wild West'
I used to sing Bennie and the Jets
So boss now I sip Henny on my jets
From the East back to the West
LAX, oh, Cali? No doubt, baby, no doubt
LAX, oh, Cali? No doubt, baby, no doubt
  (Welcome to Cali)
LAX, oh, Cali? No doubt, baby, no doubt
  (Welcome to Cali)
LAX, oh, Cali? No doubt, baby, no doubt
  (Welcome to Cali)
