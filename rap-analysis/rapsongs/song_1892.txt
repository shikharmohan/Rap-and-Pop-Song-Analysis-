It's for the ladies
Strictly for the ladies
Hey, that's all this is
She was five seven, one twenty five
Man, loose lips with those thighs
Couldn't just let her walk by
I ain't a thirsty ***
But right about now, my throat was gettin' real dry
Sho' this s*** had to be the cutest b***
I seen in a long time and I don't do this s***, like
Runnin' up on hoes, "What up, ma? I'm X"
'Cause you know how this goes, come on, ma, I'm X
We just chill, sat and talk to the first light
And for the first time, I didn't f*** on the first night
And it was aight, shorty was a thoroughbred
Like Belly, we ain't f***, she just gave me ***, for real
From the time that the sun is up
'Til the stars show up
It really doesn't matter to me
It doesn't matter, babe
There's no love like a dog's love
There's no love, there's no love
No matter what, I'll hold you down
Nobody else will come around
Don't even matter 'cause
There's no love like a dog's love
I got my dog love, got my dog love, baby
I run with shorty, pass off the *** to shorty
Do whatever gots to be done with shorty, straight like that
When I hit her like, "I'll be right back"
Yo, I'll be right back, ain't no bull***, I'll be right back
She got a *** catchin' feelin's, I'm a street *** hard body
But, she got me catchin' feelings
Man, those eyes, those lips
Be like damn, those thighs, those hips
She like blam, make a *** have to touch somethin'
Not necessarily *** somethin', as long as I touch somethin'
A *** blood boil when I see another *** holla
Don't make me have to pop a *** in his f*** collar
From the time that the sun is up
'Til the stars show up
It really doesn't matter to me
It doesn't matter, babe
There's no love like a dog's love
There's no love, there's no love
No matter what, I'll hold you down
Nobody else will come around
Don't even matter 'cause
There's no love like a dog's love
I got my dog love, got my dog love, baby
Aiyyo, *** is goin' too smooth
Since Stella got a new groove
It's like we got somethin' to prove
We gon' make it, rain or shine
My heart is yours and yours is mine
Like Eve said, 'Love Is Blind', right about now
I can't see *** 'cause you always on my mind
Been like that, since I met her
Had to have her, so I went to get her
But I'm a dog, so I didn't sweat her
And it wasn't 'bout the cheddar, I don't trick
I got two things for b***, couple of jokes and some ***
Yeah, the kid talk slick but that's not what I'm about
We got dog love and me and shorty, ridin' it out, we out
From the time that the sun is up
'Til the stars show up
It really doesn't matter to me
It doesn't matter, babe
There's no love like a dog's love
There's no love, there's no love
No matter what, I'll hold you down
Nobody else will come around
Don't even matter 'cause
There's no love like a dog's love
I got my dog love, got my dog love, baby
All I want is you in my life
All I got is you in my life
All I need is you in my life
So I know I'm gonna be all right
All I want is you in my life
All I got is you in my life
All I need is you in my life
So I know I'm gonna be all right
I'm gonna be all right, yeah
Gonna be all right
I wanna see you again
It's all I want
