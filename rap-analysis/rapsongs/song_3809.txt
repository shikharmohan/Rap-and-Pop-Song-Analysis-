A queen is not a queen because she is felt
But a queen is a queen because failure has not stopped her
Take it from me, the queen of all queens
Women are takin' over for the new millennium
What the hell do you want from me?
I'm just tryin' to be all that I can be
I'm a goddamn legacy
Thanks to B.I.G. an' Puff Daddy
The First Lady runs the world now
They impeached the President from his residence
No one drops bombs 'til I say so
One, two, one, two, three, go
I'm human, you're human
So they said but inside we're all animals
I'm human, you're human
So they said but inside we're all animals
How dare you accuse me an' my family
Fuckin' clones, leave us alone
Me an' Puff is like Janet an' Mike
You make us wanna 'Scream', know what I mean?
Yeah, yeah, I know y'all rather see us dead
No more platinum plaques, certified lead
We got too many chips for y'all
Queen Bee, Queen Bee make hits for y'all
Take a deep breath
Inhale, exhale 'til there's no more left
In the name of the father, son an' daughter
Here comes the new world order
You can't stop it, Mother Earth, this my universe
When worse comes to worse, I call the shots
Stack all the lots, pack all the glocks
Take the safety off lock, fire
I'm human, you're human
So they said but inside we're all animals
I'm human, you're human
So they said but inside we're all animals
Can I jingle it, baby? Go ahead, baby
Can I jingle it, baby? Go ahead, baby
Take it out, let me sit on it
If you can't make it wet, spit on it
Don't stop 'til it rise to the top
Promise you won't drop 'til the cherry go
An' if it doesn't fit then use your lips
Here it comes, what's my name? Queen Bitch
I'm human, you're human
So they said but inside we're all animals
I'm human, you're human
So they said but inside we're all animals
I'm human, you're human
So they said but inside we're all animals
I'm human, you're human
So they said but inside we're all animals
I'm human, you're human
So they said but inside we're all animals
I'm human, you're human
So they said but inside we're all animals
I'm human, you're human
So they said but inside we're all animals
I'm human, you're human
So they said but inside we're all animals
I'm human, you're human
So they said but inside we're all animals
I'm human, you're human
So they said but inside we're all animals
