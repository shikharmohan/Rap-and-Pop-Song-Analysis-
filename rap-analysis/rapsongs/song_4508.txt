98's, 45 paper plates
10 the whole thang big money heavyweight
A hundred stacks, spend 50 on a Caddy
25 on the pinky, bought a pound of blow and bounced back
Matchin' grills, big houses on them hills
Got them ***s in the kitchen all cookin', payin' bills
I'll start hollerin', dollar after dollar
Flippin' chickens, gettin' tickets, want the money and the power
Born stuntin', uptown hunter
3rd world G's ***** been about money
Ice chunk, Birdman red monkeys
White tees, on them chromed out 11 hundred
You know we shine every summer, we grind every summer
And this is how we spend money
You see them Bentleys and them Lambs
Them ounces and them *****, we was born hustlin'

White leather, hot new bare rims
Brand new pistol with the trigger like a hair pin
Big w***, we don't need a scale man
Big papers say g'mornin to the mailman
What'chu know 'bout putting bricks in the spare man?
I can stuff a coupe like a mother***** caravan
I'm in my zone my farm is so rare man
If there's a zone you lookin' at the chairman
How you want it? Show me my opponent
