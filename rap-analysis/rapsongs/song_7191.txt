Help on the way, help on the way
They say the game in trouble
Help on the way, help on the way
Help on the way, help on the way
They say the game in trouble
Help on the way, help on the way
I got the game on lock, standin' on top
Say hello to the man who could save hip hop
Say hello to the man who could save hip hop
Say hello to the man who could save hip hop
They say the game fucked up and the records ain't sellin'
It was bad in 06', gettin' worse in 07'
Market over saturated with all the bootleggin'
When it seems better, shawty, ain't no tellin'
Well, call Lyor, give him this message
Then hit [Incomprehensible] tell him, tell Kevin
Craig, Julie Greenwald, all of them present
The fifty mil' you gave me was a sound investment
This time around we gon' sell five
No less than four on a slow day, call Vegas and bet
By the way, if you a winner I'm the one you should be with
Hit J, tell them niggas to bet against
Grand Hustle, homie, I'ma make you respect this
They say the market share down so I ain't affected
Tell the label, relax, ain't no need to stress, shit
Just cut the check and I'll handle the rest, shit
They say the game in trouble, help on the way
Don't worry 'bout nothin', help on the way
They say the game in trouble, help on the way
I got this shit, help on the way
They say the game in trouble, help on the way
Don't worry 'bout nothin', help on the way
They say the game in trouble, help on the way
I got this shit, help on the way
I got the game on lock, standin' on top
Say hello to the man who could save hip hop
I got the game on lock, it ain't gon' stop
Say hello to the man who could save hip hop
I got the game on lock, standin' on top
Say hello to the man who could save hip hop
I got the game on lock, it ain't gon' stop
Say hello to the man who could save hip hop
You hear my name so hot, I got the game on lock
You, niggas, keep floppin' but I remain on top
Still the same old me with the same old glock
From the first CD with the Kangol top
I was hollerin', dopeboy, when I first came out
It seems like everyone in the dope game now
Man, I told these niggas that it ain't gon stop
All the hatin' gon' stop or this thang gon' blah
Most of these niggas ain't slang, no blocks
Got a lil' somethin' but it ain't so hot
Try to sell a record when my shit drop
Get the cover of the magazine when my shit out
Nope, I think not, just think why
Nigga, if you ever eye with a nigga this fly
Now watch your mouth, you ain't that high
King of the south, you ain't that guy
They say the game in trouble, help on the way
Don't worry 'bout nothin', help on the way
They say the game in trouble, help on the way
I got this shit, help on the way
They say the game in trouble, help on the way
Don't worry 'bout nothin', help on the way
They say the game in trouble, help on the way
I got this shit, help on the way
I got the game on lock, standin' on top
Say hello to the man who could save hip hop
I got the game on lock, it ain't gon' stop
Say hello to the man who could save hip hop
I got the game on lock, standin' on top
Say hello to the man who could save hip hop
I got the game on lock, it ain't gon' stop
Say hello to the man who could save hip hop
To the fans and the critics, think hip hop is missing
This is a little proof that hip hop livin'
You can hear a hip hop top now, just listen
Now see a hip hop walk out with six bitches
In the ATL see hip hop chillin'
In a multi million dollar crib hip hop building
You know how many cars hip hops driven?
Nigga, I'm everything hip hop's missing
Nigga, you is everything hip hop isn't
My heart and my soul where hip hop live at
To anyone who's ever said hip hop's finished
It can't be dead while I'm still livin' in it
I'm livin' and well, might I add at that
They say the game in trouble, help on the way
Don't worry 'bout nothin', help on the way
They say the game in trouble, help on the way
I got this shit, help on the way
They say the game in trouble, help on the way
Don't worry 'bout nothin', help on the way
They say the game in trouble, help on the way
I got this shit, help on the way
I got the game on lock, standin' on top
Say hello to the man who could save hip hop
I got the game on lock, it ain't gon' stop
Say hello to the man who could save hip hop

Say hello to the man who could save hip hop
I got the game on lock, it ain't gon' stop
Say hello to the man who could save hip hop
Yeah, man, record sale, forget about it
I do this shit in my sleep, man
They say bootleggin' is up
[Incomprehensible] up? I don't know
Everyday at my job I get better and better, man
You know what I'm sayin', check my resume
This is no motherfuckin' exception
If history serves us directly
Fuck the climate, nigga, I turn the heat up when I want to
Legend tells it, yeah, okay, okay
Aye, just gather 'round and I'll write it down, people
We did it again, baby, this ass gon' to play out down to the wire, baby
This gon' be a photo finish, Jay-Z  is gonna love me, man
If you don't like it, man
You better try to get some [Incomprehensible], man
And try to clean yourself right about now
