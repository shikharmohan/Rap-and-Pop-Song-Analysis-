Blowin' my mind
Interplanetary advisories battling for supremacy
Sounds like a good way to build up my infamy
Soon as automator sent for me
He headed over to receive
Our registration forms from the galactic embassy
Yes, may I help you? Remember me?
To escape a global panic we had to intercede
Oh, you're here for the battleforms?
Yeah, can we get them for free?
I'm afraid not, you'll have to pay the entrance fee
It was worth a try, when we first arrived on Mercury
Gravity adjustment was a must and step up contestant
Number 12 I was 13, he started bursting
Ammunition that wasn't working
His rudimentary technical abilities couldn't kill me
Knocked me for a loop but I could still breathe
He had the crowd going by appearance
Here comes the anticipated interference from his squad and gods
I bust back with an onslaught of hydrothermiclyde
To burn their third eye
Though outnumbered I come wit heat
And trigger a massive explosion to the beat
They hit me with compressed air, left my chest bare
My sonic stun gun takes 'em out by the next snare
Blowin' my mind
We won the bout
Just as the oxygen tanks were runnin' out
So we're back to the ship
Pull a map from our blip
Manipulate the cursor, recharge our essentials
Set the coordinates then flow
Through a trillion miles of space
With style and grace
Next stop, Pluto
To rock these new flows
Atmosphere, methane
Be strategic like a chess game
Leave this emcee with chest pains
I had to battle a shadow in his black light form
He dazzled me, adding three points to his score
Engulfed the microphone with darkness, added three more
The panel started to roar
I had to find the core of his power
He stretched his text, causing me to blackout
It took my gat out, I couldn't back out
It took out the sound man
I'm takin' a poundin'
I bust out an a cappella that's astoundin'
Project a unibeam through his spleen
Pulled out my x-ray cannon to disintegrate the phantom
It's night, finite cell structure ruptured
His form began to bust up into clusters
Shadowy masses spread to the greater darkness of outer space
Now I'm placed first among artists
Blowin' my mind
Blowin' my mind
Serve due, more space travel, "Computer"
"Yes Deltron, what have you?"
"Next destination?"
"The colony of Cecilia on Arthgolano"
This is apealin', hyperspace
With mic in place
We was off
Breathin' frost in the void
Thinkin' what if we are lost
Ha, entertaining ignorant thought
Land ho
Cecilia, we entered the port
Fill out a few forms then we meet our challenger
Named Q-zar
No matter who you are, I'll handle ya
He's a real charmer
I threw on my plasteel armor
He wants to absorb all the talents I worked so hard for
A biter hardcore
I busted a few shots and opened him like a car door
He was a quadruped, four arms
He hit me with four, four arms full of bronze
I said, "Automator play the song"
(You got it)
It was the theme
Made a slight alteration in my scheme
Set him up with a comition beam
With his double team
Leaned toward his dome piece
Seremed the back of his neck
With a cranial disruption syphon
Squeezed out his brain like juice
Like a python
Blowin' my mind
