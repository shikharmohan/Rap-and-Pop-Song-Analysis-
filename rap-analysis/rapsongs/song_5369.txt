Flip da beat
Oh yeah I'm feelin' this one
You remember back in your old school days
You used to have joints like this
And you'd be up in the club dancin' like your moms and your pops
I know y'all know what I'm talkin' about
So we gon' flip it like this, hmm, hmm
Before you take me out let's have a conversation
No touchy touchy 'cause it might lead to havin' relations
Let's get to the point boy no abbreviations
Don't wanna give it up too quick I wanna build up anticipation
Once you get me will you know how to act
Will you do me right?
(Ooh, I need to know, I need to know)
Once you get me will you keep my pockets fat?
Keep me lookin' tight?
(Ooh, yeah, yeah)
I wanna give it some time and get to know each other
Let's be friends before we think about bein' lovers
Ain't no need to rush it, if this is forever
If you wait on this love, I promise it'll get mo' better and better
Once you get me will you know how to act
Will you do me right?
(Do me right? Ohh)
Once you get me will you keep my pockets fat?
Keep me lookin' tight?
(Lookin' tight, ooh)
Flashlights
(Flashlight)
Neon lights
(Neon light)
Party rides
(Ohh)
All night
(Ohh)
Love me right, keep me lookin' tight
(Lookin' tight)
So nice
  (So nice)
That's what I like
(Oh yeah, yeah)
Once you get me will you know how to act
Will you do me right?
(Yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
Once you get me will you keep my pockets fat?
Keep me lookin' tight?
(Ohh ohh, yeah)
Once you get me will you know how to act?
Will you do me right?
(Ooh, I know)
Once you get me will you keep my pockets fat?
Keep me lookin' tight?
(Lookin' tight? Ohh, yeah)
