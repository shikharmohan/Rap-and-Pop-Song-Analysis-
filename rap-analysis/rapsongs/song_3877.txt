[LIL' KIM (RAP)]
Blu Cantrell, yo Gucc, I'm goin' in Dun,
This joint is HOT! Precision, where you at?
Yo what's the deal baby paw, it's the hottie-hood Kim
You got my mind spinning like my hottie-hood rims
You had a lotta women but they not like me
It's like I been trippin' on that bummbozi
I'm sick with this stick, shift gears with my lips
Put you key in my ignoition and put it in 5th
The windows fogged up and it aint from the spliff
Scratch and sniff and inhale this
I got you seeing doubles and you can't tell
It's the tag team, Lil' Kim and Blu Cantrell
Hip Hop, R&B; menage a troid
Two sexy thangs leaving with engagement rings
I'm getting impatient I need answers
I'm ready to get busy like them Sean Paul dancers
I can be a housewife or the freakiest ho, yo
Just gimme the light and pass the dro
[VERSE 1:]
The possibilites are endless for you and me
I know it will be okay
We could have everything
All I know is you are all I want
Baby, believe in us, I've got to have your trust
[HOOK:]
Oh, you got me so, if feels as though, I'm racing
I'm so impatient, Oh you got to know, You got me so
I'm chasing, I'm so impatient
Baby, I'm waiting
Baby I'm waiting
I'm so impatient
[VERSE 2:]
Unexplainable, something remarkable
Never felt quite like this
Knew it from just one kiss
Let me know
'Cause I can't let you go
Not with the love we made
Not looking for the heartache
Baby, I'm waiting
Baby, I'm waiting
I'm so impatient
[HOOK]
[FAT JOE (RAP)]
Yeh, uhh, yeh
I aint come to judge, I came to love
In fact I came to cum not makin' love
Girl, you know the rules when you're
dealin' with thugs
And girl, it's me and you, 
stop chasin' the crush
I know you want me, don't ya?
Know you need me, don't ya?
Don't lie, see it in your eyes...
Thick hips, nice lips, right size
Poppi's big, but fit in between them thighs
And it aint about the box,
it's 'bout the rocks
And that Malibu view on the mountain top
Just a few reasons why you feelin' the kid
You know, spacious cribs, outrageous trips
Forget about your friends, man,
the hate this shit
If you gave them the power
They would make the switch
Who knew those words I do
would make you rich
But for now, Blu, you's my impatient bitch
