Baby, you understand me now
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
No one can always be an angel
When everythin' goes wrong you see some bad
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
(Yeah)
Misunderstood, don't
  (We do this for the people that walk that path)
Don't let me be misunderstood, don't
  (Tryna get to their dream, yeah)
He stood on the corner with the rest of them
Though he knew that this corner wasn't the best of him
Hard streets and a life that crested him
Dirt police domestic beefs that's festerin'
He knew the president wasn't addressin' him
Though dead presidents was undressin' him
Two kids from hot sex, no protection and
People don't see how AIDS is affectin' 'em
It get hard you get, get the God questionin'
Can't find a job so you robbin' and hustlin'
He killed marks and sold dope for cousin 'em
Can't believe they would be the ones buckin' him
He on the ground, he could feel God touchin' him
He heard the sound of his moms sayin' "Trust in Him"
At heaven's gate, sayin', "Lord, please let me in
Or send me back to tell my people to be better men"
Misunderstood, don't
  ('Cause we are)
Don't let me be misunderstood, don't
Misunderstood, don't
Don't let me be misunderstood, don't
I'm just human
She dancin', she dance, she dance for them
Her body move but her mind was manic'n
Thinkin' I don't know where they hands then been
Relationships with men have been so damagin'
She thought back to when she was at Howard and
Dreams of doin' scenes with Terrence Howard and
Broadway plays and dancin' with Alv and them
The ones that make it always ain't the talented
Some dreams get lost, never to be found again
At first strippin' seemed so empowerin'
Most every girl wanna do it now and then
But bein' meat everyday is devourin'
Cats puttin' paper where she put powder and
Life would break her, now she powderin'
She was high when she fell down and then
Crowd surroundin' and heart was poundin' and
She fell into a deep sleep, the siren sounded and
Seen bright lights in the midst of clouds and then
Talked to God, feelin' like His child again
Said, "Lord, let me live so I can make You proud again"
Misunderstood, don't
  ('Cause we are)
Don't let me be misunderstood, don't
Misunderstood, don't
Don't let me be misunderstood, don't
I'm just human
The life we lead will always lead us
And we pray that He will never leave us
It's the price we pay, I guess that's the reason
Why my grandma sang, we all need Jesus
The life we lead will always lead us
And we pray that He will never leave us
It's the price we pay, I guess that's the reason
Why my grandma sang, we all need Jesus
Misunderstood, don't
Don't let me be misunderstood, don't
Misunderstood, don't
Don't let me be misunderstood, don't
I'm just human
