[Lil Wayne]
Rock star lifestyle might not make it,
President got em' in the White House naked,
Looked at the clock and it say right now,
Get a pound break it down, blow it like trial,
Panatella Dutchy wine in my tall glass,
Young Money baby, big shit like a horse ass,
Stacks in my backpack, shades on, hat back,
Bugatti matte black. Where they do that at?
South Beach Miami hoe, I'm probably with Tammy Tol,
My life is a video and the women want they cameo,
I just want the panty hoes and I'm higher than Geronimo,
And I got them tools, tell 'em boys it could get mechanical,
Now pop that pussy like a .44,
I turn ya round and bend ya over like a low blow,
It's Young Money baby, we the fucking greatest,
We don put them other niggas on a hiatus,
Beat ya bitch with a pump if she denied data,
'Cause I'll serve anyone like a blind waiter,
I make my girl come first then I arrive later,
I shake you pussies up, I'm a vibrator, haha,
Get gettin' money like hell yeah,
This shit so good it don't even smell bad,
And you can tell dad, that I'm a muthafucker,
You niggas betta not slip, Ice Road Truckers,
Light pole barrel, chopper stupid long,
New Orleans nigga, I get super Dome,
Loyal to the game, the game been good to me,
Still spittin' fire, you niggas wood to me,
We on nigga, let let them hoes know,
Young Money lay 'em down like old folks,
You comin' with it, we comin' for it,
Plenty to go around, now watch the money orbit,
Real shit people, now just absorb it,
I try to pay attention but ya'll mad borin',
And got so much swag I need a ad for it,
And I don't like to brag so my bitches brag for me,
Oh she a good girl, I gotta transform her,
She give me hot head, I call it global warming,
If we gon do it dog, lets do it now,
I am more animal then the zoo allowed,
Put me in the wild, I'll be there for a while,
You niggas little league, call 'em Curacao
Energizer money, it keep goin',
I'm laid up, I'm free throwin',
Who rebounding, who gives a shit,
Fuck dat, I got 27 years of this,
Hit or miss, I hit your misses,
You are local news, I'm 60 Minutes,
I, I hit the target, I hit the witness,
I work out in my office, guess I'm fit for business,
Too many visions, completed missions,
Still ice'n out crosses, keep it Christian,
We consistent, the streets commend it,
Weezy F. Baby, the F is for forensics,
From start to finish, Usain Wayne,
OK ya doin' your thing,
Well thangs change, you plain Jane,
I'm diverse, I save the World second,
And I get high first,
I'm a mind freak, check my time sheet,
Bitch I bring the noise, where the lions sleep,
Yo flow never wet, like grandma pussy,
I'm always good, like grandma cookies,
Yeah call me the screen or the swine fixer,
It's goin' down like the Catalina wine mixer,
She goin' down like the hands on my time ticker,
I'm always strapped, Vietnam nigga,
We are fine nigga, like Amber Rose,
And we ball nigga, like Jalen Rose,
You better tell them hoes,
I got a million flows,
Label me the hardest nigga in civilian clothes,
Young Money baby,
And the bulding grows as we look up,
Where did the ceilings go?
