but i always keep a straggler, thats known to bone 
and run through a lap, faster than marion jones

gained a couple fans having made the transition 
but im still in the hood like a transmission

i got it locked from here, all the way to cak-a-lacky 
but keep a mac for scrapping, thinkin its just laffy taffy

If chickens on the radar, I'm at it 
'cause I get it on my day off, aint nuttin like getting weighed off 
Scrape off the plates 
Shake off the flakes 
Dad daddy make all the kit kat 
I gotta lay off the way ya'll hate me like I'm adolf, 
But ya'll cant see me, Ray Charles 
I steal whores 
I'll probably take yours 
because you peel off and I take off 
Give me no space whatever I want I takes, 
whatever I need I bleed and see 
Bitch nigga don't breathe on the weed 
I'm fucking with them birds 
without feeding them seeds that's creed you don't know about it,

flippin all the harder back, make them catch a heart attack 
when you see the narcs attack lemme know, start to clap, clap ,clap 
but start with he deals, your pa be on chill

heart in the grill its far in my mills 
Cruise the city with the semi or the celly 
on skinnies like i'm starving my wheels 
(CHORUS)
