Puff Daddy- 
Ladies and gentleman 
(Come on throw your hands in the air like this one time) 
One-two, this thing on right here 
(We ain't gonna stop) 
Can y'all hear me out there? 
(And we want every one in this motherfucker to get out their seat) 
Ladies and gentleman without further adieu 
(It's our time) 
I'd like to introduce to you, my bitch 
Lil' Kim- 
Fuck that, bitches don't deserve to rap 
I'm back, and I'm about to murder cats 
Trying to take my crown, I ain't letting that go down 
I cop the four pound and go the whole twelve rounds, yeah 
You broke hoes need to throw in the towel 
Life's a wheel of fortune and y'all can't buy a vowel 
Who me? That's none of your concern 
Like ashes in the urn, more money to burn 
Damn my ass is firm, stay away from germs 
Pussy flawless, get wetted in worms 
If you only knew like Aaliyah 
How your man be hawking me and stalking me 
When he fucking you he see me 
Every crack valve or record he sell I get a piecey 
Easy, believe me, my words is credible 
Ask Nat Cole huh, I'm unforgettable 
Don't let the QB get a hold of your guy 
Sex him well, get him high, he might fuck around and die 
(Chorus) x2 
Lil' Kim- 
I guess you know by now who's number one 
Brooklyn, Brooklyn that's where I'm from 
(Number one) 
So if you got beef better think again 
(Number one) 
Cause you can't win 
(You can't win) 
Your so called vendetta was light like birds' feathers 
Even with an umbrella, you can't stop my hurricane 
I moved on to bigger and better things 
Y'all still making minimum wage 
First on stage, like the ever I graze 
Leave you amazed 
And keep the fifth by the rib cage 
All you jealous ass holes is rebellious ass holes 
Still trying to recoup from the first album ass holes 
You's a gangster, prove it 
Wanna shoot me, do it 
That's word than Jerry McGuire 
I'll set that ass on fire 
That's how you work with barbed wire 
Carve my name in your face 
Pour gas-o-line on you and drop you at the gas station 
Y'all chicks ain't blind, I shine like polyeurotheme 
Cocoa butter crÃÂ¨me 
That's the gleam of drugs baby like codeine 
Low self esteem, eh-eh, the flows excellent 
Your's is satisfactory return them to the factory 
I mean practically, the shit is whack for me 
Mama bear, finally out of hibernating 
Here to tell you chicks to stop tailgating 
(Chorus) x2 
It's the B-I-G-M-A-M-A 
Often tipsy, cabin in Percipsy 
I've been in this shit since Biz hit the, one-two 
Nothing left to do 
Move it in there, cathedral ceilings 
Don't come to my house, it might hurt your feelings 
P Diddy introduced me to the business side 
Fired me a few mill and a couple of oil spills 
That's how we do it, you chicks is no thrill 
Doin' it Flinstones style, car with no wheels 
Still on tricycles, riding bicycles 
Our diamonds be so white they look like icicles 
I'm getting sick and tired of hearing all these rough drafts 
On the countdown, don't make me laugh 
Got my own company, I'm chief of the staff 
They say we twins then I'm the better half 
I'm nasty worse than Howard Stern 
This court is adjourned 
And now it's your turn bitch 
(Chorus) x2 
Puff Daddy- 
Can you feel me? 
I just wanna know if y'all can feel me 
I just wanna know if y'all can feel me out there 
It's not a game, we're back 
And this time we're not going anywhere 
Number one, that's my bitch 
Recognize! Ya feel me? 
Yeah, yeah, yeah
