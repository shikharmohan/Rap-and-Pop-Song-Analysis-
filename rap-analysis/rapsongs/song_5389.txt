Rock the joint
Me, I'm a supa fly
Supa dupa fly
Supa dupa fly
  (I can't stand the rain)
Me, I'm supa fly
  ('Gainst my window)
Supa dupa fly
Supa dupa fly
  (I can't stand the rain)
Me, I'm supa fly
  ('Gainst my window)
Supa dupa fly
Supa dupa fly
  (I, I can't stand the rain)
Me, I'm supa fly
  ('Gainst my window)
When the rain hits my window
I take and  me some indo
Me and Timbaland, ooh, we sang a jangle
We so tight, that you get our styles tango
Sway on dosie-do like you loco
Can we get kinky tonight?
Like coco, so, so
You wanna play with my yo-yo
I smoke my hydro on the dee-low
I can't stand the rain
'Gainst my window
(Against my window)
I can't stand the rain
'Gainst my window
(Against my window)
I can't stand the rain
'Gainst my window
(Against my window)
I, I can't stand the rain
'Gainst my window
(Say what?)
(Yeah)
Beep beep, who got the keys to the jeep? Vroom
I'm drivin' to the beach
Top down, loud sounds, see my peeps
Give them pounds, now look who it be
(Who it be?)
It be me, me, me and Timothy
(Me, me)
Look like it's 'bout to rain, what a shame
I got the armor-all to shine up the stain
Oh Missy, try to maintain
Icky icky icky
I can't stand the rain
I can't stand the rain
  (Say what?)
'Gainst my window
I, I can't stand the rain
'Gainst my window
(Yeah)
I can't stand the rain
'Gainst my window
I can't stand the rain
I feel the wind
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten
Begin, I sit on hill's like Lauryn
Until the rain starts, comin down, pourin'
Chill, I got my umbrella
My finger waves be dazed, they fall like humpty
Chumpy, I break up with him before he dump me
To have me, yes you lucky
I can't stand the rain
'Gainst my window
I can't stand the rain
'Gainst my window
  (Against my window)
I can't stand the rain
'Gainst my window
(What?)
I can't stand the rain
'Gainst my window
I can't stand the rain
(What?)
(Like that baby)
I can't stand the rain
(Can you stand the rain?)
(Stand the rain)
I can't stand the rain
(What?)
(Can you stand the rain?)
I can't stand the rain
(Can you stand the rain?)
(Can you stand the rain?)
I can't stand the rain
(What?)
'Gainst my window
I can't stand the rain
'Gainst my window
I, I can't stand the rain
'Gainst my window
(Yo)

(Why not, break it down like dat)
'Gainst my window
(Break it down baby)

(Misdemeanor)
I can't stand the rain
