Niggas and flies, niggas and flies
Niggas and motherfuckin' flies
Niggas and flies always in some shit
Nigga can't stay outta shit for shit
Nigga robbed a bank- now everybody know
Cause nigga had a Rolls Royce clipping through the ghetto
Nigga bought his ho a fur coat the next week
And them loss had his ass walking butt naked down the street
You want drama nigga?  I gots drama
What about these niggas drive Beamers living wit they mamas?
And what about these tennis-shoe tasting bitches-
Fucking athletes to obtain the riches
But they hate it when a nigga call 'em hoes and tramps and sluts
But if the shoe fits- lace it up
Niggas ain't good for shit but eatin' barbeque
And holding other niggas back- that's all we do
Niggas annoy me like flies
If it was up to me, I'd burn a gang of you hoes alive
Niggas and flies, niggas and flies
Niggas and motherfuckin' flies
I went to the million man march- it was all good
A bunch of niggas standin' up for they manhood
But niggas are so idiotic- 
They still found something fucked up to say about it
But that's a nigga fo yo ass, g
Howl at a nigga if you lookin' for some negativity
Cause niggas got plenty of it- I think they love it
Clarence Thomas- you a motherfuckin' puppet
Ass-kissin' politicians ain't shit to me
And motherfuck the NAACP
Motherfuckin' cowards, suckin' up to the sponsors
And couldn't give a fuck about the black johnstons
So called black radio stations
Runnin' they flap- talkin' bout they don't play rap
But rap pay the bills, motherfucka
And keeps a nigga out of jail, cocksucka
Niggas get on top and niggas hate it
Cause niggas can't stand to see another nigga make it
So how the fuck are niggas coming together to take the first step
When every nigga out to sell-
Niggas and flies, niggas and flies
Niggas and motherfuckin' flies
