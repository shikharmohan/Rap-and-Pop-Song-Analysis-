Right about now I think it's time you explained to everybody
The real reason you wear this chain around your neck tight
Yo, yo this Puff Daddy number 1 6 double 0 3 0 5 0
Representin' Davenport the experimental prison
Y' kno' whut I'm sayin'? Representin' double I for life 1 18
Too many of my people got time it shows as crime unfolds
Many snap in a trap now new minds explode
Learn the ability to find their goals
Locked in a facility where time is froze
God knows the heart hurts to see no sky, just dirt
They give a man a cell quick before they give a man work
So we get into this black, this black cat syndrome
Grow older like there's no heart and no soul ingrown
Bars and cement instead of help for our people
Jails ain't nothin' but the slave day sequel
Tryin' to flee the trap of this nation
Seein' penitentiary's the plan, ta plant the new plantation
They say we'll take the animals from cottons and crops
Straight to forgotten wit locks, plottin' to rottin' our stocks
They draw a crooked line and wait for your foot ta fall under
Serving most of my brothers another football number
Judges look at our seeds, these brothers like enemies saying
"We don't need G's" giving out years like free cheese
Free please, nigga, ain't no freedom who's locked up?
Who's shot up? Who's strung out? Who's bleeding?
Keep reading, I'm here to explain the chain remain the same
Maintain for the brothers and sisters locked
The chain remains
The chain remains
The chain remains
The chain remains
The chain remains
Prisoner 1 5 4 3 0 5 0 representin' Jersey all y'all niggas better back
The fuck up, man, it's gettin' busy, yo this is Big Kym
Comin' straight outta Compton, I'm locked up in Fort Dix, New Jersey
Number 0 7 3 9 3 0 6 7 I, I be checkin' y'all out in 1997, later
Nowadays still we're captured, still hear wicked laughter while shackled
We're beaten and battered then cuffed after we're tackled
We're tugged while increasing the mugged and indecent
Hit one more time, wit a black jack  then dragged in the precinct
Still don't know what the back and forth, looking meaner
Meant stripped made into a convict, booked then fingerprinted
How many more times of this humiliation?
How many more bouts do we have to lose
While we fight for our rights in this nation
That we supposed ta have since birth
But the breaks on the bricks get worse so it's jail first
And that's all they offer us, ain't that right Mr. Officer?
The chain remains

This is Orion 15 4 31 0 5 0, up in Tennessee outta Fort Dix
Representin' Cleveland and Ill town
Some rob blocks does it matter or should it?
While ghetto's dodge, cops duck bullets and pull it, I
(Hang out and hustle wit my friends)
'Til the end, 'til the day we burn pens
Ain't no mystery we need victory
The system conspired, the days of the riots ain't retired
But brothers staying calm cos they soldiers
'Til when the only solutions revolution, no we told ya
The chain remains 'til we arise
Stuck in a land where we ain't meant to survive
And I hope this don't suit ya, some work
Like a slave ta get a hit but won't work to save for a future
And that's when the cost is the man within
And we're just as lost as the land we in
Some blast, some based, some dropped down
And most who sold it right now are locked down and rocked round
And it's been happenin' so much
That they make it so that it ain't even no shock now
The chain remains
The chain remains
The chain remains
The chain remains
The chain remains
This is Lil' Steve 1 6 0 0 6 0 5 0, chillin' at Fort Dix

Peace then this is, aah Lil' Pers, aah 14 6 23 0 1 6 Washington DC
Right now I'm up in Fort Dix, aah, Jersey outdated is 12/25/2003
Way I'm thinkin' is, aah, it's on mad stuff
And we all better do somethin' for the brothers
Who is locked dizzown 'cos they locked down
And I don't care if we definitely lock down the heat
Do something, do somethin' bad, peace out
Yo what's up, this Terreet Pett, formerly known as 1 11 7 19
I'd like to give a couple of shouts to some of the brothers
I was locked down wit in Borentown, Aleem Jones
