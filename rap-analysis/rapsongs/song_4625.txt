Baby, we've been together for so long
And I just don't know, why you continue to do me
The way you wanna do me?
I checked your cell phone and I saw a number
I didn't notice he called on that, so somethin' tells me
Either yo' mama done change the number or you cheatin'
How could you do this to me after all these years?
Girl I don't know what in the fuck you think this is
Always tryna play around and tell lies while you are not at home
Sorry girl, you busted now, I saw the number on yo' cell phone
You cheatin'
You was cheatin'
(Yes you was)
Caught you creepin'
(Yes I did)
To the window, to the wall
Skeet-skeetin'
(You triflin' hoe)
Heavy breathing
(Yes you was)
Now I'm leavin'
(I got to walk out right now)
('Cause I just can't take it girl, you was cheatin')
You was cheatin'
(Yes you was)
Caught you creepin'
(Yes I did)
To the window, to the wall
Skeet-skeetin'
(You dirty bitch)
Heavy breathing
(Yes you was)
Now I'm leavin'
(I got to get outta here)
('Cause I just can't take it no more)
La la, Percy don't you know?
We've been through this type of thing before
Oh Lord, but this time it's different, I know I ain't trippin'
I looked in the cell phone, saw another man's digits
Well now, you must be trippin'
'cause you know it's not the same
She caught you from her mama house
And maybe her number changed
No, she got the two-thousand minute plan
Callin' her minuteman, I'm packin' the kids up
We gone in the minute babe, she was cheatin'
  (No don't do it Percy)
You was cheatin'
(Yes you was)
Caught you creepin'
(Yes I did)
To the window, to the wall, skeet-skeetin'
(You cold busted)
Heavy breathin'
(Out the door)
Now I'm leavin'
(No mo' checks and no mo' child support)
Oh my God
You was cheatin'
(Fuck that)
Caught you creepin'
  (I can't believe that she would do this to me)
To the window, to the wall, skeet-skeetin'
  (Give her another chance, Percy)
She don't deserve it
Heavy breathin'
 (No no
Now she's leavin'
  (No she don't)
(Let me count the ways that I loved you girl)
I say, one, two, three, four, five
Really wanted you to be my wife
Then I say six, seven, eight, nine, ten
Really wanted you to be my friend
Then I say eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen
Can't, think of nothin' that rhyme wit', fifteen
Oh Lord, the background singers just messed up
(Well, Percy I don't give a fuck)
Well, tell me where we gonna go
(We're going to 'The Minstrel Show')
You was cheatin'
(Yes she was)
Caught you creepin'
To the window, to the wall, skeet-skeetin'
  (We're live at the show and I don't know where to go, baby)
Heavy breathin', now I'm leavin'
  (Oh, I'm so hurt, I'm so tired, I don't know what to do)
(I'm so turned around and I just turn around of seein' faces)
(And then I just wanna bawl out)
I know how you feel Percy
  (You was cheatin', caught you creepin)
You don't understand
Believe me, I know how you feel
  (To the window, to the wall, skeet-skeetin')
How do you know?
  (Heavy breathin')
You know in your heart
  (Now I'm leavin')
That you don't want nobody but her
