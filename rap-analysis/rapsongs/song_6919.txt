Yo, what's up, this is Tajai of the mighty souls of mischief crew
I'm chillin' with my man phesto
My man a-plus, and my man op, you know hes dope
But right now yo, we just maxin' in the studio
We handlin' from east Oakland, California
And, sometimes it gets a little hectic out there
But right now, yo, we gonna up you on how we just chill
Dial the seven digits, call up Bridget
Her mans a midget, plus she got friends, yo, I can dig it
Here's a forty, swig it, ya know it's frigid
I got 'em chillin' in the cooler, break out the ruler
Damn, that's the fattest stoke I've ever seen
But what does Keen and Cali gettin' weeded, makes her feel like maui
Now we, feel the good vibrations
So many females, so much inspiration
I get inspired by the blunts too, I'll front you
If you hang with a punk crew
I roam the strip for bones to pick when I find one, I'm done
Take her home and quickly do this
I need not explain this, a-plus is famous, so get the anus
Hey, miss, whose there? I'm through there, no time to do hair
The flicks at eight so get it straight
You look great let's grub now
A rub down sounds flavor, later there's a theater
We in the cut, the cinema was mediocre
Take her to the crib so I can stroke her
Kids get broke for their skins when I'm in
Close range, I throws game at your dip like handball
'Cause the mans all that, all phat
I be the chill from 93 'til
Yeah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
Huh, my black timbs do me well
When I see a fool and he says he heard me tell
Another persons business, I cause dizziness
Until you stop acting like a silly bitch
Yo, crews are jealous 'cause we get props
The cops, wanna stop, our fun, but the top
Is where were dwelling, swelling, phat, no sleep
I work fifteen jerks get their hoes sweeped
Under their noses, this bros quick
To hit blunts and flip once I'm chillin' 'cause my crews close, kid
I boasted, most kids accept this as cool
I exit 'cause I'm an exception to the rule
I'm steppin, to the cool spots where crews flock to stare at them
Or see where the shit that's flam
Bland leaking out his pocket
So, I got tons of Endo and go to the ho ins, basement
My ace spinned, phat and enough tracks
Time to get prolific with the whiz kid
Greenbacks and stacks don't even ask
Who got the fat sacks, we can max, pumpin' phat tracks
Exachangin' facts about impacts
'Cause in facts, my freestyle talent overpowers
Brothers can't hack it, they lack wit, we got the mack shit
93 to Infinity, kill all that wack shit
Ah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
I be coolin', schools in session but I'm fresh and
Rappin' so I take time off to never rhyme soft
I'm off on my own shit with my own click
For many bad bros with their fat stoke gettin' blunted
Folding blunts, holding stunts captive
With my persona, plus, I bomba
Testin', niggas is testin'
My patience but I stay fresh and
Restin' at the mall, attendance on low
But I am shopping for my winter
Exploits, some new fits, come new kicks
I often do this 'cause it's the pits not being dipped
Flip, the flier attire, females desire
Baby, you can step to this if you admire
The extraordinary dapper rapper
Keep tabs on your main squeeze before I tap her
I'll mack her, attack her with the smoothness
I do this, even when my crew gets
Loot, props, respect and blunts to pass
Crews talk shit, but in my face they kiss my ass
They bite flows but we make up new ones
If you're really dope, why ain't ya signed yet?
But I get, my loot from jive, zomba I'ma bomb ya
You will see from now to Infinity
Ah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
Yeah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
Yeah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
Hah-hah, just coolin' out, ya know what I'm sayin'
But, but whos chillin' around the land?
You know? Yo, who's chillin'? I think I know who's
Chillin', tell me who's chillin' toda
Casual, you know hes chillin'
Yo pep love, he gotta be chillin'
Jay biz, ya know he's chillin'
Ay yo, my man, my man Snoop is chillin', man
Yo Mike G, you know hes here chillin'
Yeah, my man Mike P, he know he gotta chill
'Del the funky homosapien' is chillin'
Hey, my man Domino, yo he's chillin'
