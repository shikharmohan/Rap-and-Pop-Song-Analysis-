Motherfuckin  ladies and gentleman  
 My style's rugged like Timberland  
 When I clock lyric then women give me more love than Wimbledon  
 And I can't stand it  
 My style flow local like New Jersey transit  
 And you'll need Teddy to unjam it when I cram it  
 I'm from N to the E  
 When I wave bitch you better say heeyyyyyyyy  
 W A R K  Newark NJ got the AK  
 I'm a Kid From the Hall  
 I got big balls to make your pussy walls dribble in my drawers  
 Hey boy this is the way the East coast swing it so bring it  
 Man I told you ass Brown-er than James with the Sex Machine shit  
 I keep the chronic patrol on the road  
 in case you're wondering why I keep my izm  
 My style's the ultimate funk when I mic checka  
 Cause I smoked everybody else's shit up  
 One two checka  
 So check the, manuscript, man you flipped  
 And I give effects to niggaz with my Black and Decker  
 Put it down if you can't handle it  
 Got a B-R-C-G, Blunt Rollers College Graduate  
 I got a degrees in Physics on how high I can get  
 Then next I check how many niggaz that can die from my Tec  
 and fuckin niggaz everyday  
 Cause the N-E-W-A-R-K is where the niggaz robbin and stealin  
 Now Jersey's on max so pass the dutchie on the lefthand side  
 Hide the hidash, in case we cridash, in my ride  
 So, sliiiide, before I call the medics  
 You can bet bitch you couldn't get fly if you were FedEx  
 Can I, drop the funk on ya, run it on ya  
 Strong as ammonia, smell it from here to California  
 Cause Reggie Noble dropped that cock named Noble at Sunoco  
 I'm better than rice and beans when I rock you ocho to ocho  
 Convertible, fuel-injected, that's why my style's well-respected  
 I'm dope on the ridealz, so fidealz, on my didealz  
 My music more underground than a kid at 300 XL  
 And chumps are wondering what two niggaz dropped the funk funk  
 Verbally you never heard of me I smoke you third degrees  
 
 cause Reggie Noble's known like burglary  
 and cause surgery for emergency  
 Hey, if it take a million niggaz to stop it just like Chuck did  
 I get hot busted when I dip my nuggets  
 Keep it heated for the brothers that's not off my block  
 Cause we run around Newark with the nine cock  
 And if ya don't know the flavor, be a tough guy and enter  
 So go show you more nigga events than Jacob Jaffrey center  
 I'm genuine, to the rhyme, get your canines  
 Cops that got the hot glock stocked for when it's playtime  
 I rock around the Robin TWEET TWEET on the calendar  
 Cause you couldn't pull my number if your class major was Algebra  
 Cause I'm more deadlier than a whole school system of investors  
 I make bitches moan to my Stallone without Sylvester  
 So check us, I always smoke mad blunts before breakfast  
 Cause I, Get Around like 2Pac with Poetic in my Justic  
 Hold tight, hold tight, everybody hold tight  
 I'm sooper like my man cat, cause I keep my styles jam packed  
 I wrreerawwwowww like Anthrax, split my pants like Bill Bixby  
 You could tell the tracks was fat from the work of my MP-60  
 I smoke the chronic that's why my sinus always fucked up  
 Them bones, them bones, them bones will have you fucked up  
 I blaze blunts with my nigga Mellow, yo say hello  
 (Yo whattup dogg?)  
 
 Really, now pass the second blunt to Quilly  
 Now sit your big ass down 'cause I don't know about this rap stuff  
 There wasn't rap when I was pickin cotton, sayin massa  
 Y'all y'all whippersnappers, with the caps on backwards  
 Man, y'all fuck around with Quilly I kick a bone out yo' ass quick  
 Watch out now, I ain't bullshittin  
 I representin the oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-G's from forty-three goddamnit  
 I'm gonna whoop your ass, til your heart stop beating  
 And if you keep on with that dirty mistreatin  
 
 And yo, chronic bubonic the funky bionic  
 you find it I'll have to rewind it where minds are blinded  
 Time 4 Sum Aksion so time to find it  
 I smoked out like a cookout, look out my dick's out  
 That was last album when I was bouncin on trains like Malcolm  
 I was hiiiiigh, I thought I wouldn't survive  
 That's why I quit my nine to five and got live  
 Because this hip-to-the-hop shit fills my pockets  
 And I'm Audi for ninety-four because I already got my props  
 Hoes, hoes, and more hoes
