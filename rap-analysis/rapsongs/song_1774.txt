Ay yo I kick it to shorty and try and help him understand 
Hit em with work cause yo that's ma lil man 
He asked a few questions bout tha game and I told him 
So when he made a bad move it was ma place 2 scull him 
Never told him nuttin wrong 
Kept it fair 
He didn't listen so I might as been talkin to the air 
Everybody makes a few mistakes 
A mistake is aight 
If it's not then I'm a tell you straight time to say goodnight 
Nobody likes to be played regardless of the relationship 
But shorty fuckin up big time I hate this shit 
I'm caught in the middle of havin luv for a lil nigga 
What was expected of me as a real nigga 
Ma next move is crucial 
What do I do? 
How do I keep it real with shorty and ma crew 
Didn't wanna kill em so instead of puttin tha mac on him 
Did the only thing I could do turn my back on him. 
(aight) 
(chorus) 
Here we go again 
Same ol shit dawg just a different day 
Here we go again 
You know how niggas do when we play how we play 
Here we go again 
A mans gotta do what a man gotta do 
Here we go again 
So if it's fuck me nigga you know it's fuck you. 
[DMX] 
The niggas I fuck with I wanna get em dead 
But I'm kool with shorty's peoples so I let me live 
Under normal circumstances he would be a marks man 
But I just hit em with a gram 
Just didn't shake his hand 
Go on bout ya business 
Be what you wanna be 
Do what u wanna do 
I washed ma hands I'm threw 
I can forgive I just cant forget 
You on ya own lil man don't ask me for shit 
If u paid attention to what I told you then u good 
If I see u next time get it understood 
Go on before I change ma mind cause u know you should be dead 
I just wanna say "aight" go head 
My instincts told me sumthin 
But I'm a good nigga plus I owe his peeps a favor 
But I also knew that the decision I just made 
Went against the rules of the game that we play 
(chorus x2) 
[DMX] 
I should of followed ma first instinct 
Cause I knew 
Sometimes u gotta do what u gotta do 
Now this nigga fuckin with the competition 
Ungrateful muthafucka should of got him missing 
He had the nerve to take ma kindness for a weakness 
Gotta get back on some street shit so I can creep this 
When I act 
Take 1 
Set em up 
Take 2 
Get'em there 
Take 3 
Get em done 
Wasn't hard to get him where I wanted him 
Confronted him 
Zzzzz click.there was a bullet in 1 of them 
Feeling lucky 
Click 
Looks like you are 
Click click click 
Luck ain't goin to far 
See what you did was put on another pare of shoes 
That just happen to be to big 
What you did was stupid 
Real fuckin stupid 
Well shorty I gave you a chance and what did you do 
Threw it back in my fuckin face so fuck you to 
Chorus till fade
