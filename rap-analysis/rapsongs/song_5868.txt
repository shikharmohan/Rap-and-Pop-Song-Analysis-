Once again it's on, it's on
Put me on the planet, damn it, where all the slim shhh look like Janet
Slick consider this how I lick it and then fan it
Pick, rub and ran it how I run it yeah I ran it
And it ran frantic rub put new poonanie panic
Plan it, as a package, pick it and then pack it
Trick it and attract it, throw a crack then catch it
Quick as richocet rabbit, quick 'cause it's a habit
To rap it as fast as another brother runnin' rapid
Never call you sir
Who gives a damn if you Mix Alot?
East coast gets the props
Producers rock your knot
Baby ain't got back, baby got black
That's why you see
The black baby and you respect that
Checka check it out, on and on and on, rock on
To the breaka breaka dawn it's on
On and on and on, on and on and on
Checka checka it out, to the breaka breaka dawn
On and on and on, on and on and on
Checka checka it out, to the breaka breaka dawn, it's on
Make room for one rude boy
Bad mood boy, new and old school boy
Now watch a true man take out all the school boys
And don't get out of touch 'cause you just get a slut
With a "Closed for repair" sign on your nuts
Yeah we're the thing slangers, body boom bangers
Breakin' in your shit with a hanger
Damn real I'm gonna live it up
Never forgive your cut on my back
Watchin' your girl's gap give it up
I touch you where it hurts first
Brutalize you with a verse, criticize my lyrics work
Think about a lost block, black stop
I'd rap and make a wack drop then slap you with my back drop
The boom-bang slap papper's fat fat
Step in my path and get that ass cr-crack cracked
Checka check it out, on and on and on
Rock on, to the breaka breaka dawn it's on
On and on and on, on and on and on
Checka checka it out, to the breaka breaka dawn
On and on and on, on and on and on
Checka checka it out, to the breaka breaka dawn
Singin' like a Buddha bang
Hang out with a true crew
Down with the coochie bang
Brothers come to do the same
But monkey see, monkey do
Get your monkey ass playing
Individuals get original 'cause a this a be critical
And pickable and pitiful
I ain't with the big con heart
Rippin' other rhymes apart, here to spark me some iron parts
I stick to a city with some ripple, hit a bitty from the middle
Hang on kitties like a cripple nipple
Checka check it out, on and on and on
Rock on, to the breaka breaka dawn it's on
On and on and on, on and on and on
Checka checka it out, to the breaka breaka dawn
On and on and on, on and on and on
Checka checka it out, to the breaka breaka dawn
On and on and on, on and on and on
Checka checka it out, to the breaka breaka dawn
On and on and on, on and on and on
Checka checka it out, to the breaka breaka dawn
