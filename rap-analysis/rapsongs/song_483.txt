Friends, friends, friends, friends, before we go any further, let's

Bizzy: 
Mo Thug in him, and even all of the people that'll support me, when 
I'm in a bind and all the way to depend on, I don't need to 
know, then I (fret), deep (in the sin/and I sin) when the ship's away. 
So win again, and again, that'll help me (?). Can I get a 
witness who thought of me within. I don't trust no hoe not even one I 
had before. Hoes you won't roll . It was probably me so 
we go. We know what went wrong, and I know your mom is laughing, and 
it's your aunt's baby's daddy in Cinncinatti. 
Wonder why bitch happy.. [Look at you.] And I'm out there rapping, 
ready for the war, and end of the nights, but blessed, I'll 
be blasting enemies testin'. Watch out for my friends. 
Wish: 
Bet I got my friends, bet I got my dog, bet I got my Bone, yeah. We 
straight up killas, we're realer. We just want the money, 
y'all hate us. We don't deserve 'em. Murder one, if a nigga go 
murdered them all, they fall. Nigga wanna see the Bone fall, 
y'all, but naw, we too raw. I remember, back little ways when we was 
so hungry, when we were so hungry, but now thank the 
Lord, my thugs, we got money. We got money, hey. We got money to 
parlay, we got money to parlay. Watch out, if I miss 
ya, hit ya, bet one of these thug niggas get with ya, split ya. How ya 
feel about murda, man? It's still the same, fuck with us, we 
bang them brains. It's like suicide, nigga do or die, when ya fuckin' 
with mine. We gon' ride. In the end, somebody gon' die 
tonight. Don't be fuckin' with my friends.

Layzie: 
I can tell when the devil, I'm doin' his work and, lurkin', 
approachin' me like I'm a servant, but in order to prevent events and 
your torment, repent 'cause I gotta protect my fortune, and that's my 
friend 'til the end. When we rollin' in my Benz, never 
know what's next to occur. Young entrepreneur, who can see through the 
bloody blood. We ready for divide and conquer 
playa hation, infiltration, any situation y'all muthafuckas bring. 
Come prepared for eternal warfare, and I really don't care, 
'cause I'm sayin' my prayers to the Man upstairs keepin' my niggas out 
here so strong, endurin' this pain and strain to survive. 
Lookin' out for each other everyday, and our peoples' comin' up 
readin' the Bible. Willin' to die if the wicked is near me, if y'all 
ever try to come with some crooked shit, nigga. What it is, it's the 
book of thugs. Come a little bit closer, nigga, take a look at 
this, picture this vision of a mission accomplished. Bone thugs all 
the way 'til the end, and again, and again, and again, and 
again, don't try to come between my, my . . .

Krayzie: 
Mama told me watch your friends--they can be enemies within quick to 
pretend like they fit in. Get in, they bring it all to an 
end. I know ya cannot choose survival, (pinch ya). Nigga tried to 
infiltrate the click. We're gonna get ya. No evil gets in me 
apart from my people. Militant, that's how we choose to roll, and we 
road warriors up out the war, the war, the war. When 
you call my name I will be there. I'll be there. Never have to worry 
about nobody else, and even though I know ain't no mo' 
time, it's almost time. Let's ready for Armageddon, it's gonna get us, 
are you ready? What about your friends? Friends 'til the 
very end through the freezing, wicked winds, wicked winds. What about 
your friends? 
Flesh-N-Bone: 
I've been ready for the pain, I'm here to bring all the noise. Don't 
think you can avoid the wrath, then get 'em in a (math), after 
the fact that that's God destroyer, and you thought that the coast was 
clear, but you couldn't see or hear Flesh slowly creepin' in 
silence. Know it ain't over, took you over, (decrepitate) in your 
grave 'til then only Mo Thug. The violence trippin' in and out 
the insane asylum. Livin' life and goin' to Hell. Police, they trail 
and wanna lock me up in a cell, 'cause I stay high, smoke, 
inhale. And I play ready with an AK-47, no thang, I'm a set it off, 
aim and spray. Anticipation'll get you slayed, but what if he 
hesitate? Make my day. They lay, any day, any fool, if he choose to go 
pick up a tool, and do me in. Well, then, come get 
this shit done and over with, partner. Must've been one of my friends. 
Better watch you back for the people you think are 
your homies up in my face, I compete with ya, phony. I said only Mo' 
Thug allowed, and only real soldiers can roll, G.
