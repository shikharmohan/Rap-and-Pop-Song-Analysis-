Dear Mr.Ouija, let 'em know who the boss is
So nigga you wanna get tossed in the river?
Nigga, put 'em in the mud, see them pump blood, nigga, no love
Me show 'em the Bone when I grab that chrome
Gotta haunt that dome
Folla me, roll, stroll down East 1999
Gotta find these row hoes
Nigga, if you woke up and all of a sudden
Nigga, you was off inna my hood?
I'm a real thuggish nigga
So a, I would have to kill ya so die
Popped off to the coffin
Pick up my pump dump chumps in the gutter pain
Nigga got ta fucked up bang
Taking no shorts so fuck ya man
Claim my thang to slang them bloody bodies
Kill 'em all, send them hoes up in flames
Krayzie insane to the brain
Hey, we slay niggas who think we play
Nigga, me deadly wid the gun
Machete be dipped in rum
Running wid the gun, steady bucking
Leaving them bodies dumped off in the alley for dead
I'm near, kill 'em all, mo' murda, mo' murda
That's what Ouija said
Gotta put one in ya head, bang
We coming to serve ya,
Mo' murda, mo' murda, mo' murda

Will I die of murda, bloody mo' murda?
Living in the Land of the Heartless, coming up daily
Until a me murda them all, I'm never gon' fall
So I'ma murda them baby
Get 'em up wid me thugs
See 'em on the corner and they slanging them drugs
Giving up shots out to the glock, glock
Eighty eight to the ten five
Them killas be pumping them slugs
Niggas be fiending me daily
Me silence me twelve gauge eruption
And I'm on a road to destruction
And steady be busting and bodies be busting me
Killa with a buckshot, I'ma peel ya
Number one assassin's still the realer nigga
Down for my crime, niggas be down
Trying to stay to tha grind
Niggas is going insane, taking a shot to the brain
And man, so call it a shame
But what be the thang up offa this murda game?
And I'm feeling not a bit remorseful
My twelve gauge just so forceful
So playa, hate when I'm in ya town
The nigga, me bucking 'em down
And I'm giving up peace to the hustlas
Thugstas and twelve gauge pumpstas
Drug 'em in gutters mo' murda, me style, now
Put 'em on the ground, lay down
Nigga check my thang the way that we swang
When I'm coming to serve ya
Wid the nine cocked and it's ready to pop
Letting off shots, Layzie, be screaming
"Mo' murda, mo' murda"
Mo' murda, mo' murda
Come, come again
Mo' murda, mo' murda
Come, come again
Mo' murda, mo' murda
Come, come again

Gotta kill, get 'em nowhere to run
Can't get away from my shotgun
Leaving them bodies fucked up
Pump, pump to the ground, better leave it alone
Nigga wanna die when fucking wid
Mo Thug, nigga, we killed this bitch
Now you wanna catch some bang bang
Nigga wanna die when I let my nuts hang
What is it in me makes me feel
Like I gots ta murda ya?
You slip when I'm high
Pulling my trigger and nigga, you die, soldier
Four killas we creeping and coming to hurt ya, mo' murda
Better pack that five five
I'm feeling like killing, you dying tonight
You don't wanna hear that glock pop
When the glock pop pop, don't stop
We all about murda mo'
Finger on the trigger, Mo Thug let go
We straight from Cleveland
Clack back nigga ya bleeding
You don't wanna fuck wid Bone
Pulling that chrome now, nigga, ya gone
If you wanna die, bye
See you in the gutter, let Mama cry
Watch Mo Thug Killas pump pump
Put 'em in the ground with his head blown, gone

Eternally thugstas die, will I die of murda now?
East 99, follow me grind
And all descending that body underground, way down
Me ride and everyone dies
And I rolling wid my killas
And all, ah my thuggish ruggish niggas, no lie
Drugging up bloody, mo' victims, get 'em, get 'em
That'll be little Ripsta, sinister
Kill y'all, put 'em in the river
Bodies shiver, fuck that nigga
Hit 'em up inside, minds be blowing, I'm dumping
Remember me spray 'em, slay 'em, gauge 'em, laying 'em
All up off inna the coffin, ready to fade 'em,
To buck or to shoot wid the twelve gauge eruptions
Creep out your seat, would ya we come to stay?
Found out none of my niggas was bluffing
For the love of the murda, man, the murda game
The same but a bang bang bang
Can't resist to bump you, now pow, run 'em all off
St Clair stays, down for the murda mo'
Oh, no, ho when a thugsta, stroll
Forty fours still pointed at the po-pos
Stop 'em, drop 'em, numb those 'til out cold, they froze
You know, nigga, we can't be bluffing
We bang insane, when I put one to your temple
Mo' murda then blow out ya brain
Mo' murda, mo' murda
Come, come again
Come bloody murda
Come bloody murda
Come bloody murda
