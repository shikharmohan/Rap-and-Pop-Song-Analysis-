Yeah, 'bout to get my head right on this one
Oh oh oh yeah, oh oh oh, uh-huh uh-huh
Yeah, yeah c'mon
Hav' come through, slump low with the seat back
With somethin' in the stash to push a elephant bean back
Shit, my shit is touchin', hungry hurry up need that
Tryin' to live right, only a junk for the relapse
Perhaps I'll fold, maybe I won't
Go back to it like an old bitch I boned
Nigga havoc he a problem 'specially when he zoned
Let a nigga get foul like the wool he smoked, so
Smell me people, these clowns ain't equal to I
Bitches feel me 'cause they love my vibe
Know what a chick want, know what a chick need
Recognize the difference from a male, and chicken feed
I'm blessed that's why my neck is glistening
You in a slump 'cause you not listening
We hold our own and earn our keep
And never ever get more than the one eye sleep
(We up!)
Word man
(We up!)
I be havin nightmares son
(We up!)
(And I love it, and I love it)
(We up!)
I don't even wanna go to sleep no more
(We up!)
I be havin the illest dreams son
(We up!)
Tell you about this shit son
(We up!)
Yo
(Everybody wake up!)
I'm havin' dreams of squeezin' a gun that don't work
And some nigga with a tech come and wet my shirt
I catch bullets in my stomach, and them shits burn
I wake up sweatin', holdin' my stomach 'cause it hurt
Yo the shit seem too real, I'm dyin' of thirst
I gotta drink mad water just to calm me down thirst
'Fore I get back to sleep, and get some rest
Then I can't get back to sleep, I'm too stressed
I got the shorty real close, right under my bed
I know that work, 'cause I been practicin'
With my gauge at the range, nigga I'm nice wit it
Nigga motherfuck them dreams, I'm real life wit it
You'll be coughin' up yo' spleen', guts an' all kinda shit
You invade my space, I'm beatin' the case
Nigga come fuckin with me, yeah that's my kind of shit
Please, or all of my guns'll be a waste
(We up!)
Yeah, I feel you my nigga
(We up!)
No doubt
(We up!)
That's why I'm glad we up man
(And I love it, and I love it)
(We up!)
We got niggaz to do that shit for us y'know?
(We up!)
Word up man
(We up!)
That's right my nigga we up
(We up!)
Everybody wake up!
