She looks good to me
Shes got everything I want
(She's got everything I need)
She looks good!
She looks good to me
Shes got everything I want
(Oh Yeah)
(She's got everything I need)
Every time I look at her eyes
I'm knocked out
She slides like a river on a rescue fountain
Jump on board now
Slide up and down
Nothing else matters 
As I hear my heart pounding
She looks good to me
Shes got everything I want,
She's got everything I need
Yeah she looks good to me
Every time I see her I can't bear to breathe 
Shes got everything I want,
She's got everything I need
(She looks good)
She looks good to me
Shes got everything I want 
(Oh Yeah)
(Shes got everything I need)
Yeah she looks good to me
Shes got everything I want,
Shes got everything I need
Yeah she looks good to me
Shes got everything I want,
Shes got everything I need
Yeah-he-he-ah oh
She lays there asleep and I listen to her breathe
Sweet in the mouth says that shes with me
All I think about is the moments like these
And hold her in my arm and make her believe it
She looks good to me
Shes got everything I want 
Shes got everything I need
Yeah she looks good to me
Every time I see her I can barely breathe
I can barely breathe
She looks good to me
Shes got everything I want
She's got everything I need
Yeah she looks good to me
Every time I see her I can barely breathe
She looks good to me
Shes got everything I want
She's got everything I need
Yeah she looks good to me
Every time I see her I can barely breathe
