When I step up in the place, ay, yo, I step correct
Woo-Hah!! Got you all in check
I got that head nod shit that make you break your neck
Woo-Hah!! I got you all in check
And you know we come through to wreck the disco tech
Woo-Hah!! I got you all in check
Throw your hands up in the air don't ever disrespect
Woo-Hah!! I got you all in check
Busta Rhymes up in the place true indeed
Yes, I catch wreck and that's word on my seed
I guarantee to give you what you need
One blood everybody like Junior Reid
Wake up every morning yo I must up seed
Nationwide darkhorse make the world stampede
Yo, really let me roll some weed
Mad charged nigga now I must proceed
Yo, we 'bout to make you set speed
Peace to Baby Mike, Q-Tip, Ali Shaheed
Watch me knock you out like Apollo Creed
Body blow bustin' your shit making you bleed
Just feed off dynamic flows an take heed
Need more information homeboy then just read
Ay-ya, you can read all about the pure breed
Do the bogle dance I'll do the pepper seed
When I step up in the place, ay, yo, I step correct
Woo-Hah!! Got you all in check
I got that head nod shit that make you break your neck
Woo-Hah!! I got you all in check
And you know we come through to wreck the disco tech
Woo-Hah!! I got you all in check
Throw your hands up in the air don't ever disrespect
Woo-Hah!! I got you all in check
How dare you ever try to step on my suede shoes
Top Gun shut down your front like Tom Cruise
Please let me get down and blow a fuse
Actin' fool breakin' shit down to molecules
Yo, let me hit you with my ill street blues
Busta Rhymez always headlines the street news
Woo-Hah!!
Yo baby girl don't be confused
Sail my seven seas and enjoy my boat cruise
I know you really want to know
Who's comin' through leaving bloodstains and residues
Sorry homeboy but your flow sounds used
Gotta pay your dues baby you know the rules
Whenever I travel the world I land cruise
If you choose to fuck around you get bruised
Now I got you gassed on super unleaded fuels
Get me through give me some space you excuse
