And them little boxer dudes, Get a watch or two (Whoa)

Rollin through Planet Hollywood knockin that Killa Cam (Whoa)
Up in V.I.P. with F.B
With a nice throw back, Right below a good G
Now, dude is ill, I'm lovin his boys
I'm all, seing he's gangsta, I'm watching him swift now
They wanna see us, Bitches they wanna be us

And everything we do, They assist like Jamaal Tinsley
Cocky bastard, I only spits acid
Slept on Broken Silence, Fever bout to smash it
This here's a classic, We keeps it drastic
I'm all engaged engaged to dough and married to plastic
And you know how we do, Fresh pair Air Force 2's
