Chorus: (2x)
I hate it when it's too many niggas
Not enough hoes
Too many rookies
Not enough pros
The game got switched on some Ludacris shit
So all yall can suck my dick
I got em whip like miracle
Ludacris lyrical fool
We dirty south
Shut yo mouth
We rock jewels
No holds barred
But obey the block rules
Cock tools put chlorine in record pools
Are there anymore like ya
Hell nah
I treat humans like students
Fail yall
So turn your books to page 69 and start sucking
When organize drop the track and start ducking
When Ludacris get in the bed then start fucking
You wanna be starting somethin
Get out the booth and let me tell yall the truth
We kick down doors
Save all the h20 for front rows
Live in the bank and watch what stank hoes
Stay chromed out
And thats on or off road
If you know what I mean
Proceed to stay clean
Light skinned nigga turned red but get green
Inhale some of that dro but blow steam
Love a combination big ass and tight jeans
Chorus (2x)
Boy you done lost yo mind
Nah I lost my virginity
And I shot quick like that fool that shot Kennedy
Whats the remedy
Henessy coke
If you cut all yo money you still be half broke
Ashes to ashes
Smoke or get smoked
We come by the masses you come and get choked
Take me for a fool I'll take you for a joke
Tired of fast food so they cooked up dope
So now we eating lobster shrimp and thangs
And watch for imposters thats been in the game
We invented the game
And yall just got hipped
Man what that smell
Probably you're upper lip
Cause I love to walk around like my shit don't stank
Even if its cigars in that purple colored dank
Filling in the Gump wit no track of Tom Hanks
Go put this in your jaw like weeners and beef franks
Chorus (2x)
I put too much sugar in my Kool Aid
And party like a kid wit a high top fade
Arrive to a show and I'd like to get paid
Arrive to a ho and I'd like to get laid
Right up on my back like rugs and floor mats
I'm on the right page but what's my format
I wave to the ocean cause I'm where shores at
And women go nuts just like my bosack
Did you know that
Man I'm the gift of change
Electric stove so give me the keys to the Range
Shagadelic beautiful but strange
Went to Magic City saw Nikki in blew flames
Rearrange
Same braud different night
Pass the E&J; and let a nigga get right
The bomb threaten'd dude that's on your same flight
The highlights that I neva high ass light
Chorus (2x)
