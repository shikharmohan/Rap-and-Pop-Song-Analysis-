Lloyd, I got you, yeah
Ok, I'm Weezy, baby
And I am from the south where we call all our women, baby
Hey baby, hey baby, all day I say hey, hey, hey
I ballin' like Fade-A-Way, 3 letter credit A okay
Black car, black car, girl, I got a black car
Can I buy some of your time and charge it to my black card
You can be my bittersweet, shake that sugar and salt
Chain full of asphalt, bullshit walks, cash talks
Car black, car big, car fast, Carter
Can I stick my pencil in your sharpener
Beat it up like it's a drum, call me Travis Barker
Tat tat tat, boom boom, tat tat, boom boom, tat tat, brr psh!
All I really want is for you to back it up gon and put your weight on it
'Coz it's all right, do what you wanna, make me believe it
Ooh, I wanna see ya get it shawty, get it shawty, get it shawty
So, g-g-get it shawty, get it shawty, get it shawty
