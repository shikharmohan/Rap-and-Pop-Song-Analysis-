Michael Phelps this one for you baby
I'm goin for the gold,
My heart is in control,
My mind is on succeed,
And I am in the lead.
Don't buy into the scheme
The science or stratege
Just giant n u t's
Brings triumph and believe
I'm reliant on riddim
Inspired by the green
Never tired nor fatigue
Never defiant to my team
Never lying on the thing
Until I'm lying on the thing
Hooked to wires and things
I'm a die as a king
If I don't
Do it now
I'm a try it again
When I do accomplish it
I'm a try it again
I'm a riot insane
I'm a lion my mane
Hangs down
To my strings
And they're tied to the game
I stay dry when it rain
I'm tired of the fame
Got everything to gain
And I'm proud of the pain
The pride and the blame
The wise and the strange
Denied by the sane
Besides we're the same
Who's guiding the train
Who's flying the plane
Who's driving the lane
Who dies when it bang
Who fires when it bang
Who lies in the aim
Two lives in the drain
Who cries when they sing
You hide but you can't
You hide but you ain't
I advise you to think
You won't find what you can't
Revive what you taint
Survive what you paint
Supersize what you shake
The fries and a drink
Admired as a saint
Defined by my rank
Combined with my strength
my time and my length
And I'm a iron out the kinks
Yes I'm on the brink
And in the eye of a wink
I'm a retire in a bank yeah
And I'm no quitter cause I'm a go I'm a go I'm a go getta and I'm no quitter cause I'm a go I'm a go I'm a go getta
Yeah I I'm gon get it I I'm gon get it yeah I'm gon get it yeah
Cause I'm a go I'm a go I'm a go getta
Victory consistently
Train all year
To be the enemy's misery
No stress visibly
Neither does it enter me
I think postively
You can't harm me mentally
Not physically
Not spiritually
You'll never get rid of me
I am the epitome
Of "this is what you did to me"
Nothing is what you did for me
Nothing is what you give to me
I take whatever I'm visioning
Now break all the limiting
Now shake all the gimmicking
The fakery
The trickery
Nurse
How sick is he
Worse
I'm sickening
I'll be at the finish line
First
How quick is he
I'm on that show
They mention me
For the next century
I ain't with the bickering
I am full of dignity
I am full of energy
Pull out the inner me
A bull after dinner meat
I stood in the winter heat
It could be the end of me
But good be defending me yeeeaaahhh
And and I'm no quitter I'm a go I'm a go I'm a go getta yeeeaaahhhh and I'm no quitter I'm a go I'm a go I'm a go getta and I'm no quiter I'm a go I'm a go I'm a go getta
Yeaah I'm allergic to cheating
I hate failure
And I am in love with achievement
Above and beneath it
A hug when I greet it
My eyes on the prize
And I love when I seek it
Done with the speaking
Begun with the preaching
I pray
Until I am one with the deacon
I play
Until I have won whatever we win
I play
Until I have won and then I re-win
Yeeeaaahhhh!
And I'm no quitter
I'm a go I'm a go I'm a go getta
Yeeeaaaahhh
And I'm no quitter
I'm a go I'm a go I'm a go getta
I'm gon get it yeah I'm gon get it yeah I'm gon get it yeah
And I'm no quitter
I'm a go I'm a go I'm a go getta
Yeeeaaaahhh
And I'm no quitter
I'm a go I'm a go I'm a go getta
Yeeeaaaahhh
And I'm no quitter
I'm a go I'm a go I'm a go getta
And I'm no quitter
