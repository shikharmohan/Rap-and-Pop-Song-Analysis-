She loves me, she loves me not
Yeah she loves me not
The fiends need me, I ain't around it, bones ache
Detox, rehab, cold sweat, watch 'em shake
I'm not that genie in a bottle, I'm in a bag
Take one hit, I slide off to the land of the H man
When we first met, I thought you'd never doubt me
Now you tryin' leave me, you'll never live without me
Girl, I'm missin' you, come and see me soon
Tie your arm up, put that lighter under that spoon
Now put that needle to ya arm princess, stick it in
Relapse you fat bitch, don't ever try that again
All that shit I did for you, I made you feel good
We have a love thing, you treatin' this like it's just a fling
What we have is more sacred than a vow or a ring
You broke my heart, you dirty bitch I won't forget what you did
If you give birth, I'll already be in love with your kids
Listen, I don't give a damn if your ass start smokin'
But we have a bond and it's not to be broken
We got a love thing where you try to leave me
But you need me, can't you see you're addicted to me?
We got a love thing, I can take you higher girl
Fuckin' with me, you can be all you can be
We got a love thing where you try to leave me
But you need me, can't you see you're addicted to me?
We got a love thing, I can take you higher girl
Fuckin' with me, you can be all you can be
Baby you know, on the low your sister be eyein' me
I'm good lookin', so you know, sure she be tryin' me
I heard she bisexual, she fuck with that girl
But boy, oh boy, fuckin' wit me is a whole 'nother world
After that first night, she fall in love, then chased a feelin'
I hung out with Marvin when he wrote 'Sexual Healing'
Kurt Cobain even good friends, Ozzy Osbourne too
I be with rock stars, see you lucky I'm fuckin' with you
I chill with Frankie Lyman and Jimmy Hendrix crew
See this is new to you, but to me this ain't new
I live a lavished life, listen if the mood is right
Me, you, and your sister can do the do tonight
I never steer you wrong, you're hyper I make ya calm
I be the incentive and reason for you to move forward
Let's make a date, promise me you'll come and see me
Even if it means you have to sell ya mama's TV
I love you, love me back, no one said lovin' me'd be easy
We got a love thing where you try to leave me
But you need me, can't you see you're addicted to me?
We got a love thing, I can take you higher girl
Fuckin' with me, you can be all you can be
We got a love thing where you try to leave me
But you need me, can't you see you're addicted to me?
We got a love thing, I can take you higher girl
Fuckin' with me, you can be all you can be
I love you, I got you barefooted on glass, chasin' a dove
That monkey on your back, symbolizes my love
Your friends talk bad about me bitch, you sit there and listen to 'em
Over and over you hurt me, my love is unconditional
They talk to you when you up, you down they got nothin' to say
But when you call, I'll come runnin', I'll always take the pain away
They set you up, to let you down, they crowned you prom queen
Fiddle about me behind your back, they call you a fuckin' fiend
Can we just be alone, so I can kiss and hug you?
Plus me beside you, no other man can loves you like I do
Call me daddy, I'll make you feel good, I mean real good
I found pleasure in pleasin' you, like a real man should
It was written long before, it was carved in a tree
Forever me and you baby we were meant to be
There's more to life than laughter, what brought us together was fate
And we'll be hand in hand, when you walk through those Pearly Gates
And to see to that, I'ma do whatever it takes
We got a love thing where you try to leave me
But you need me, can't you see you're addicted to me?
We got a love thing, I can take you higher girl
Fuckin' with me, you can be all you can be
We got a love thing where you try to leave me
But you need me, can't you see you're addicted to me?
We got a love thing, I can take you higher girl
Fuckin' with me, you can be all you can be
