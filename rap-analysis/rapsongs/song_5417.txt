Ecstasy, a place of fulfillment and fantasies
Where your dreams become realities?
Mmm, ecstasy
It enhances your most inner desire
To become more free with your guts and feelin's
E-e-ecstasy
Boy, let me free your mind, let's hook up tonight
Take you on a flight, high, high
Make you warm inside, I won't waste your time
My love is so divine, it feels like I'm on
Ecstasy, I'm willin' to do the things I said I wouldn't do
On ecstasy, the feelin' makes me feel like I'm in love with you
Boy, look into my eyes, I'm so energized
Make it last long time, touch me
Everythin' feels sweet, my body feel your breeze
Up all against me, it feels like I'm on
Ecstasy, I'm willin' to do all the things I said I wouldn't do
On ecstasy, the feelin' makes me feel like I'm in love with you
Oh, it feels like I'm on ecstasy
Everybody jump in and do somethin'
Feel so free, I feel like makin' love to you
So what you wanna do?
Ecstasy, everybody jump in and do somethin'
Feel so free, I feel like makin' love to you
