Yeah, right about now
Motherfuckers is layin for a nigga like me, Ice-T
To bust some freestyle shit but I don't do that
I just cold lounge up here at the ammo dump
With my nigga Aladdin, SLJ, LP and my nigga Henry G
Yeah, we do the shit like this
The card after the ace is deuce
So cut the nigga loose on the 3
That's me, the motherfuckin', T
I got ride on my surfboard, rhyme hard
But only buy the shit that I can't afford
That's everything, that's why I truck big fat rings
'Cause in the motherland gold is for kings
I got backup to jack up, punks who try to act up
Do a world tour, watch the big bank stack up
Motherfuckers get dropped with the quickness
I got an ill left and a right fist make mistakes
And you'll lose or you might die 'cause
I'm the wrong Ice for your bruise and that's no lie
Meanwhile the penile is stacked to the top
With my niggaz, mostly for squeezin' triggas
I call 'em homies, pigs call 'em crooks
So I write and put bucks on they books
I give a fuck about a cop or a G man
They all talk shit, their breath smellin' like semen
I catch 'em in the alley all alone
Put 'em in the prone, pop, pop, pop to the dome
It's the G-style
Gangsta style
G style, the gangsta talk, I got a Teflon .9
And it eats vest, I take a motherfucker out quick
Just for talkin' shit, ride rolls, catch hoes like a mitt
L.A., Atlanta, New York, yo, my shit rocks
Chi-town, Miami, Detroit, I get much props
Because I roll with the hardcore G
Every street's the same street to me
I don't bullshit, I don't quit writin' a rhyme fit
K K K pray each day that I get hit
Motherfuckers try to flip on the Icepick
Move and slip, close the eyes and catch a fuckin' clip
Not in the ghetto no more but I do hang
Got a black game and it's sittin' on them thangs
I kick the game from the street not the slamma
Tighten up my knockas with a big lead hammer
It's the G-style
Gangsta style
Some of the times, I write my raps with extreme speed
Some of the times, I take the pen and make pads bleed
My mind clicks to homicide, bullets fly, ladies cry
A lot of people die, some nights I can't right
Stare at the blue lines, I think, I'm a go blind
Then the beat becomes me sit in the dark
And write a whole fuckin' LP, G Style, the gangsta talk
Never near soft, hard as a knockout 'bout
It's no sellout, I keep crime in my rhyme
'Cause it's my thing, packed with guns and drugs
And lots of street slang, A B C D E F and LAPD
Words from a motherfuckin' OG, ammo dump
Pumps the sounds that you bump in your trunk
So turn it up punk, what'cha 'fraid of? What'cha made of?
Pull the pin, set the grenade off, blastin' sounds out ya jeep
On every city street, nigga, straight gangsta beat
It's the G-style
Gangsta style
Many like to dress the style and act hardcore
Many motherfuckers are and they crack jaws
I like to lay in the cut in a nightclub, don't smoke bud
Drink suds but I gets loved, mack, cool
I scope the freak with the mad backs
Hit her with the gangsta style, cool, relaxed, bam
Put her in the Benz, bump, Too Short, let her know
Right off the top, what's my sport, you think long
You think wrong, you got it goin' on, baby doll
But I won't sing you no love song, you either love me
Or you don't, you're either rollin' tonight or you won't
She likes the style, 'cause it don't bullshit around
Tongue in my ear, real slow and then it went down
I gotta flip into a ill mode, pack a clip full of hype tracks
And then unload music for the hardcore beat down
No weak pop shit, strictly underground
And if you don't like the style as I get wreck
Ease back nigga, catch a knife through the neck
It's the G-style
Gangsta style
