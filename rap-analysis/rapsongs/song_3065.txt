Wessyde fa life in ya
Throwin' up the W, throwin' up the W
Yeah, I'm with this, what we throwin' up?
Throwin up the W
All you busta ass niggaz out there
I got my motherfuckin' homeboys in the house
My nigga Ice Cube, Mack 10
Back to set the record straight
For all these busta ass niggaz
Who trip, this how we do it nigga
Front back, side to side
We be givin' it up till the day we die
Niggaz hit me up, I'ma have to erupt
So motherfucker west up
Front back, side to side
We be givin' it up till the day we die
Niggaz hit me up, I'ma have to erupt
So motherfucker west up
Nigga clear the lane, here I come once again
With this, gangsta click, droppin' this, gangsta shit
Strictly for the riders who ride us I gotta west sider
Rhymer for them niggaz that's sittin' on them Dayton wires
Pump the bass, hit the switch 'cause Ice Cube
Mack 10 and Dub-C, back up in this B I itch
Straight hoodsta for life, ain't no lookin' back
Ink in my flesh, west side tattered on my chest
Walkin' with the shadow of death through the land
Of the skankless, south central Los Angeles
Home of the Crips and the Bloods
Where even the strongest niggaz is drug through the mud
And visitors from outta town best to stay in Hollywood
You get that tourist ass ganked strollin' through my hood
West coast till the casket drop
I be throwin' it up, so motherfucker west up
It's gun ho mack one,oh please, you can't fuck wit deez
Ice Cubez and Dub-Ceez is my G'z
And hip-hop, top three niggaz the new bosses
Never slippin' 'cause we flosses, packin' Nina Ross'
Nigga, thought you knew how we do it
Ain't a damn thing changed, always on them thangs
Forever and a day, so back up, gimme room, don't neglect
Just respect and everything I can't check I wreck
Now you can cross out the bustas and snitches
Shit only killers hootchie bitches and hot hydraulic switches allowed
On the turf where the real hogs dwell
Sewed up the hood, the fattest bolas on the block for sale
Inglewood city, the throne I call home
Niggaz be so bright, you might need your locs on
To bail through, it's fin you're in with Mack 10
And I gotta confess up, nigga this west up for life
Front back, side to side
We be givin' it up till the day we die
Niggaz hit me up, I'ma have to erupt
So motherfucker west up
Front back, side to side
We be givin' it up till the day we die
Niggaz hit me up, I'ma have to erupt
So motherfucker west up
Now I got ta show you how the west coast rocks
No razor blades in my mouth, just a glock
And I'm hittin' you up, with that W S
The sun rises in the east but it sets in the west
No gold teeth, you gets a wreath
So hand me the goodies, stockin' mask, no hoodies
Christmas day, I'm in a tre
While some of you niggaz got the robe reindeer and a sleigh
We don't call it five, oh, we call it one time
It's my life my life my life my life in the sunshine
One nine weighs a ton
How the fuck you think that the west was won?
Now shit can be squashed over a forty ounce of backwash
No jokes, the land of locs and hundred spokes
In the east, we can be brothers but when you come to L.A.
Watch your motherfuckin' colors west up, nigga
Front back, side to side
We be givin' it up till the day we die
Niggaz hit me up, I'ma have to erupt
So motherfucker west up
Front back, side to side
We be givin' it up till the day we die
Niggaz hit me up, I'ma have to erupt
So motherfucker west up
Give it up, give it up like the nigga James Brown
Me and my niggaz are puttin' it down
So bustas be wary cause see we represent the city
Where niggaz caught slippin' is left with they brains drippin'
City of the angels, more like a concrete jungle
Full of macks Cadillacs and crack sacks
I pledge allegiance to the shit till I die
So let the five-twenty slide
And put it down from the west side
Front back, side to side
We be givin' it up till the day we die
Niggaz hit me up, I'ma have to erupt
So motherfucker west up
Front back, side to side
We be givin' it up till the day we die
Niggaz hit me up, I'ma have to erupt
So motherfucker west up
West side
Throwin' up the W
