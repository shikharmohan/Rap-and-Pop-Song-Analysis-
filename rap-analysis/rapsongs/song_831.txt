We grind y'all, bounce back, open your mind y'all
Grind your whole ass till you twist your waistline
Y'all know the time, hey yo feel the base line
Stack the overdrive, bounce, baby feel the incline
So geniune, everytime, Busta redefine
The wicked knew the dime, makin' y'all press rewind
Hope you feelin' fine, watch me combine and intertwine
The bounce rock skates make you cross the foul line
Shine a nickel nine on all kinds of little swine
Stick the worst of porcupine if you tryin' to take mine
Yo, pick up my nigga Splif in the blue 5 S's
Sportin' out tan, interior blue head restses
Move, baby no time for second guesses
Been articulate the right bounce as the flow finesses
Yo we gettin' papers spreadin' love and happiness's
Shit blazin' so hot, DJ's scratch the test presses
Like make it mo hot baby
Turn it up, I wanna hear it real loud, just
Turn it up, so we can party in the loft, baby
Turn it up, we need to tear the roof off, so just
Turn it up, I need to make it mo' hot, baby
Turn it up, I wanna hear it real loud, just
Turn it up, so we can party in the loft, baby
Turn it up, we need to tear the roof off, so just
Turn it up
Yo, aiyo, word is bond, baby let's get it on
I never say it wrong, baby girl take off your thong
Let me put it in your spirit like the holy Kyron
Got the mega song, sweet like honey chicken dijon
Movin along, yo, honey body look real strong
Watch your ass swing hangin' like a medallion
Exercise baby, let me see you spread on the floor
What you askin' for? Relax, I'm 'bout to give you some more
Where the liquor store? Hit you with some more metaphor
The raw, hot to def shit you never seen it before
Hit the deck, on your mark, get set, we 'bout to jet
Spark it like ingelet, chickens breakin' their neck
Yo we play to win, such a shame, shit is a sin
So hot baby body heat bubble your skin
Everytime I flow speak, I caress the whole beach
Just like the body guard Les straight walkin' the street, we get down
Turn it up, I wanna hear it real loud, just
Turn it up, so we can party in the loft, baby
Turn it up, we need to tear the roof off, so just
Turn it up, I need to make it real hot, baby
Turn it up, I wanna hear it real loud, just
Turn it up, so we can party in the loft, baby
Turn it up, we need to tear the roof off, so just
Turn it up
Yo, yo, come on baby just feel my heat wave
A lot of hot ones ready for niggas that act brave
Chill son, you better off if you behave
Flip money while broke niggas tryin' to save
Lay low, I say so, my pesos
Import my cheese stack by the castros
Make clothes  or stay fly a chase hoes
Equatorians soft lips and straight nose makin' dough
When we rippin' the paid show, get the money and dip
We in the Range Rove, now we makin' grands
We name brand, we make plans, change plans
Then we expand across land, do it properly
Yo, I said open sesame, the recipe,  be the hot shit, it's got to be
Yo, landscape, we arrange a whole shape, rock the fly tape
Then I continue to skyscrape, like blah, so hot we gotta
Turn it up, I wanna hear it real loud, just
Turn it up, so we can party in the loft, baby
Turn it up, we need to tear the roof off, so just
Turn it up, I need to make it mo' hot, love
Turn it up, I wanna hear it real loud, just
Turn it up, so we can party in the loft, baby
Turn it up, we need to tear the roof off, so just
Turn it up, I wanna make it so hot, baby
I wanna hear it real loud, just
I wanna make it so hot, just
