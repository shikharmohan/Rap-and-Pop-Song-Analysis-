Uhh, yeah how we hit it?
Check it out
Shorty don't front, you better act like you're widdit
Frontin' like you never did it, bitch admit it
Matter fact, shut the fuck up and turn around
If you still got walls I'ma tear the shits down
Just one of few brothers vigorous with the dick
Prepare to stay long, 'cause I don't come quick
Little or big, I tear that ass out the frame
Talkin' like you're ill, but the shit is all game
You're weak on top, you can't ride like a stallion
Hit it from the back, then I'm Audi 5000
But if you're ill we can chill smoke the fat Phil'
A little somethin' just to make shit real
Off with the light, fuck a invite, just make sure
You don't got the period, 'cause I don't want red lights, aight?
You know my motherfuckin steelo
Rippin' from the back, bitch you know how we go
Hit it from the back, hit it from the back
Hit it from the back, like dat
Hit it from the back, hit it from the back
Hit it from the back, like dat
Uhh, knowmsayin'?
Check it out, word is bond
Knowmsayin', gonna flip it like dis
Rink-a-dink, rink-a-dink, dinky dink
I used to hit raw daddy, but now I carry packs of three
Bulletproof I refuse to let the monster get me
I'm in, hit it from the back like that
Shorty black never tap no skins that look wack
I got mad game like Twister
Nasty little mister, quick to talk dirty to a sister
I met the shorty at the Skate Key
What's her name? Nevermind, 'cause she might try to sue me
Juiced her up, took her to the projects
So uh, if she was good then maybe we could have sex
You know what happens next, drop to your knees
Bitch caught a bone, as heads spin, I win
As she starts to proceed, she said she wanted me
To drop a seed, I told her parlay and just be
'Cause cunt little stunt with my butter dick shorty
You talk too much, so lay back and enjoy the blunt
I put it in her, she starts to wild
She said slow down, I said this is shorty wop style
A versatile, rough sex, fuck love makin'
Flip the script shorty, and flip yourself over
On your hands and knees Cochise
From the back I don't shoot blanks and I'm out black
Hit it from the back, hit it from the back
Hit it from the back, like dat
Hit it from the back, hit it from the back
Hit it from the back, like dat
Hit it from the back, hit it from the back
Hit it from the back, like dat
Hit it from the back, hit it from the back
Hit it from the back, like dat
Knowmsayin?

Shorty don't front, you better act like you're widdit
Frontin' like you never did it, bitch admit it
Matter fact, shut the fuck up and turn around
If you still got walls I'ma tear the shits down
Just one of few brothers vigorous with the dick
But better stay long, 'cause I don't come quick
Little or big, I tear that ass out the frame
Talkin' like you're ill, but the shit is all game
