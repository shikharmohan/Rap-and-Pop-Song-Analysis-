Girl we could be doing it doing it doing it doing it all night long
Making it  making it making it making sweet love

Its the way you move your body ,supersexually, you are the one for me
So baby move your body, a little closer to me, so everybody can see
There's no doubt that your what i want,everything that i need(no doubt)
Cos you do me supersexually
