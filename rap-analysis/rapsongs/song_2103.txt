(E-40)-
Not out of da' local news paper, but out da' AutoTrader. Cleaner, than virgin cuchie, my nigg', one owner Cutlass, playa'. The beat wrapped, monster cables, the speakers thump'n. Trunk sound'n like , King Kong and Godzilla, back there thump'n. All we do is drink, and get high and petal and push! Organic weed, mystery weed, just purple cush!' I cut the da' rear weld, on my whip, and filled dat bitch up', and now muscle car sit'n up high like a monster truck. Monstered up', suck up to none'. Don't be no poodle, split his pack open like pack of Top Roman Noodle. In the heart of the soil, where you can find me. Try me fuck boi', and get your face put on a White-T. 40, Turf Talk and Keak da Sneak, the maynee' ass voices, and them style's, hekka' unique. High speed chase's and run'n lights. Water in da' duals, make loud glass pipes.
