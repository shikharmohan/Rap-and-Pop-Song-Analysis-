I'm crazy and I do admit
'Cause I don't like the friends you hang out with
They like to party way too much for me
They opportuners baby can't you see
I know you think I'm tryna lock ya down
'Cause I act funny when they come around
I just want you to be simply fair
Stay at home, don't go nowhere
Cause I'd rather you not go out
Cause I heard all what your friends about
How they be dancing in the spot
Gettin' freaky off the dock
That's enough to make me lose my cool
And I'd rather you watch a DVD
Than go out with them, come on and lay with me
Cause they down for whatever all birds flock together
That's enough to make me act a fool
I know your friends be talkin' in your ear
How I'm controlling, that's not it I swear
'Cause I don't care, do what you wanna do
As long as I can do the same to you
'Cause they always seem to lead you wrong
Until they find somebody then they're gone
I don't wanna seem like I'm the same
But if you chill at home I won't complain
Cause I'd rather you not go out
Cause I heard all what your friends about
How they be dancing in the spot
Gettin' freaky off the dock
That's enough to make me lose my cool
And I'd rather you watch a DVD
Than go out with them, come on and lay with me
Cause they down for whatever all birds flock together
That's enough to make me act a fool
Baby, please make an exception
Understand what I'm talkin' 'bout
Cause I don't want you thinkin'
That I don't want you goin' out
I just can't take knowin' how your friends get down
When they dancin' in the spot
Touchy feely in the dark
It'll only break my heart
Tear my whole world apart, yeah
Cause I'd rather you not go out
Cause I heard all what your friends about
How they be dancing in the spot
Gettin' freaky off the dock
That's enough to make me lose my cool
And I'd rather you watch a DVD
Than go out with them, come on and lay with me
Cause they down for whatever all birds flock together
That's enough to make me act a fool
