Never scared to be different
The impossible's put into existence
For instance, this is me
What did you expect from the 5th LP?
Gone for a minute, now I'm back again
Back to back, back to break backs again
Put 'em in the back seat of the 'Llac again
And rip off the Magnum packagin', what's happenin'?
I'm lookin' for some girls gone wild
I'm just tryin' to make these girls all smile
And I'm gonna make 'em dance, so I can see 'em shake they ass
Then I'll put 'em in a trance 'til I get 'em out them pants
Then I'll take 'em to a level
That they mighta never been befo'
We gon' hit the do' and then hit the flo'
You'll get hit below
I got somebody I want you to get to know, me
Fearless like Jack the Ripper
Hip hop needs help, so I'm back to flip her
Flip and run 'em back 'cause I'm back to stick her
And throw up on the track like it's full of liquor
You're feelin' kinda warm, like you was havin' sex
You're wetter than a storm, like you was takin' X
Your mood intensifies, it's time for a surprise
So baby, close your eyes, are you ready for what's next?
You lookin' at rap's most consistent
Man, whatever they can't do, I can
What they wanna be in the future, I am
A hip hop mogul's right where I stand
Goddamn, I'm good
Stretchin' out the limits of music, I should
Do it like I know and how only I could
Do it like a pro and how only I would
Still I'm lookin' for some girls gone wild
I'm just tryin' to make these girls all smile
And I'm gonna pour Patron 'til I get 'em in the zone
Then I'll get 'em all alone 'til I make 'em wanna bone
Then I'll take 'em to a level
That they mighta never been befo'
We gon' hit the do' and then hit the flo'
You'll get hit below
I got somebody I want you to get to know, me
L U to the D A C
To the R I S and yeah, that's me
A gift to read minds, got ESP
Hottest thing on the go since PSP's
You're feelin' kinda warm, like you was havin' sex
You're wetter than a storm, like you was takin' X
Your mood intensifies, it's time for a surprise
So baby, close your eyes, are you ready for what's next?
Wow, MC's, I bake 'em
Put me in a circle of homies and I'ma break 'em
Mighta took your brain a minute to process
Could take the whole game a minute to top this
Just figured out that I'm ahead of my time
With a flow so fast, I'm ahead of my rhyme
Your clock is off-beat, better set it to mine
With a six year run, havin' a hell of a time
'Cause I'm always lookin' for some girls gone wild
I'm just tryin' to make these girls all smile
And I'm gonna get 'em high 'til I make 'em touch the sky
Then I'll make 'em wonder why, why, why am I so fly?
'Cause I took 'em to a level
That they mighta never been befo'
We gon' hit the do' and then hit the flo'
You'll get hit below
I got somebody I want you to get to know, me
A millionaire with extra paper
If you haven't heard, go and ask a neighbor
I'm like hot sauce with extra flavor
So put it on your tongue for your mouths to savor
You're feelin' kinda warm, like you was havin' sex
You're wetter than a storm, like you was takin' X
Your mood intensifies, it's time for a surprise
So baby, close your eyes, are you ready for what's next?
