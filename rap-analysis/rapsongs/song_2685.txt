Got all the phone calls tapes, and all the weights and ice
to get the dough and the guns, and then we straight
He had the block locked he knew the spot block
On some real web shit to get your spot knocked by killer cops
Tryin to get your shit rocked, he don't know, cause all along
We was plottin to drop on the low, he straight snitch
He don't know how it go, he saw Nas in all the Lex
Then a triple GS, foreala, I kinda think he got a

We power, the whole team shinin through like Ma rule
Worse come to worse we got shorties layin on forty-first
They want The Firm som'in awful, to tax som'in
The way we style have a nigga tryin to blast som'in
I guess the way we politic em probably got the niggaz
I know they layin like "Dunn, we got ta stick them niggaz"
In due time, they probably see the Apple sour
and once, we takin over, they'll realize The World is Ours
The faggot niggaz don't deserve bein CREAM
A bunch of snitches on the same team, tryin to reign supreme
Brooklyn Queens thing, we lionhearted never dear departed I mean
You're fuckin with Scarlett O'Hara
