You know, I've been around the world and ai ai ai
I've met a lot of people
And what I've come to find out is that people are the same
They all share the same fears, share the same tears
And die over the years
So, I'm just gon' be thankful to get what I got
And hold onto what I have, can you dig that?
And what I do, I do for the benefit of me and my kids
Dig that, talk to me
I'm so glad I've got my own
So glad that I can see
My life's a natural high
And they can't put no thang on me
I'm so glad I've got my own
So glad that I can see
My life's a natural high
And they can't put no thang on me
It's something kind of funny
How the man take your money
Be sure as he can be
In such a way you'll never see
It's a terrible thing inside
When your natural high has died
What we can't turn to dope
And put all aside the hope
I'm so glad I've got my own
So glad that I can see
My life's a natural high
And they can't put no thang on me
I'm so glad I've got my own
So glad that I can see
My life's a natural high
And they can't put no thang on me
Twinkling tinkling braids
We do all sorts of things
While you're in a modest place
Your conscious is only peace
Yeah, I had to make peace with myself, you know what I mean?
I been getting high for the what last past fifteen, twenty years
So I told myself I wanna know what it feels like to be high for life
And I mean man, I tell you it feels real good
You know, coaching your lil' kids out there on the football field
Doing my thug thizzle still but you know
Just being high for life is a different feeling
You should try it my brother, I'm telling you it's a great feeling
Can you dig that?
More and more you grieve
Until you grow another need
You claim this fantasy
You'll have no reality
I'm so glad I've got my own
So glad that I can see
My life's a natural high
And they can't put no thang on me
I'm so glad I've got my own
So glad that I can see
My life's a natural high
And they can't put no thang on me
Darling take a listen
This may be something that your missin'
I know your times are funky
But you don't have to be no junkie
Just be glad you've got your own
So glad that I can see
My life's a natural high
And they can't put no thang on me
I'm so glad I've got my own
So glad that I can see
My life's a natural high
And they can't put no thang on me
