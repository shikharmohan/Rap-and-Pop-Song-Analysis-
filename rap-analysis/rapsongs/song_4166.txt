Yeah yeah, it's kinda hard sayin' this shit to ya face
So I do it over snares and bass music take me away
I gotta hold on, hold on to my receipt
Girl to redeem your love, that's exactly what I need
Yeah yeah yeah
Young boy, I know you love me like you never loved
You know you couldn't find a better thug
And uh, you been peepin' me since I was younger
So young that you even called me your little brother
But I'm all grown up now I got my own money
I'm married and divorced and my daughter is a woman
And guess what? My daughter want another
Sister or a brother and you lookin' like a mother
I took you from a clubber to a lover
And you took another bitch husband
The other bitch wasn't doin' shit for him
She say she did too much, I say she did nothin'
She need to quit frontin' I haven't hid nothin' and you love everything
Can't hide ya feelings, won't let my pride conceal it
You got Wayne, I charge it to the game
And baby you can keep the change, but
I gotta hold on, hold on to my receipt
Girl to redeem your love, that's exactly what I need

Destiny Child CD, song number three
She cater to me till we fall asleep
Then we wake up and we pick up where we started
Then she make a nigga breakfast Sprite orange juice and barter
And she on stage waitin' for me after my show
So no time for groupies, straight to the top flo'
Yeah fresh out the shower, a smile and a towel
Then after an hour, she gon' need another shower
When I'm at home or in the coupe or in the office
Or the streets or in the booth, I'm thinkin' 'bout you
And, most of the girls that come by are cute
And they try to holla but they all on mute
And, my old girls turn they face up at me
And, they thrown they purses and they make up at me
'Cuz you got Wayne, I charge it to the game
And baby you can keep the change but
I gotta hold on, hold on to my receipt
Girl to redeem your love, that's exactly what I need
  (Yeah yeah yeah, it's kinda hard sayin' this shit to ya face
  So I do it over snares and bass music take me away)

Come home smellin' food on the stove
She done cleaned the whole house
Washed the dishes and the clothes
And when we out we do it just how we supposed
Look good for the pub, leave the drama in the Rolls
Royce, choice of car dat we move
And she get high sometimes 'cause I'm always doin' it
You hear them hallways we always doin' it
Work cut, every time feel like the first one
Perfect, when a nigga stressed dat work shit
Take away all of the pain, make it lesser than dirt
That's why you got Wayne, I charge it to the game
And baby you can keep the change but
I gotta hold on, hold on to my receipt
Girl to redeem your love, that's exactly what I need
(I gotta)
I gotta hold on, hold on to my receipt
Girl to redeem your love, that's exactly what I need
