You can call it a comeback
I lay back analyze the rhymes and realize that
Own that crown for lyrical combat
Spit more raps, to count more stacks
Kickin' back in the coup I got loops relax
I'm hotness monotonous fans is runnin' bizzack
L, please don't leave the game like thizzat never in a million years
Hell, I'll never let you down baby I drop fifty I steal gravy
And I look back on Venus
(I look)
I look back on Mars
(And)
And I burn with the fire
(Of ten)
Of ten million stars
(Guess who's back?)
And I look back on Venus
(I look)
I look back on Mars
(And)
And I burn with the fire
(Of ten)
Of ten million stars
I'm more then a conqueror double up your bets
Come and rumble with the decks
I know you had that clown picked
Mind blowin' out 'cos L still sound sick
You dream you was me I gleam lyrically
I love 'em for it it's the highest form of flattery
Doin' the buck ten chrome, skatin' on the battery
My clutch burnin' on top of the world turnin'
Rippers is just learnin' by stacks, I been earnin'
I'm the uncle, hell future of funk
Turn my joint up find out why I'm different from all these chumps
And tell your favorite rapper that I'm ready to dump
For real cat, that represented rap from the jump
And I look back on Venus
(I look)
I look back on Mars
(And)
And I burn with the fire
(Of ten)
Of ten million stars
(Guess who's back?)
And I look back on Venus
(I look)
I look back on Mars
(And)
And I burn with the fire
(Of ten)
Of ten million stars
Six figure interest on the cheddar
From music, fashion, film and television
Poppin' amaretto so what'chu got a vendetta?
I never felt better
Now forever competition
Get severed by skills you can't measure
I'm a champ you a peon
Kiss the ring begone
Known and respected on any block you be on
And be on stand there get your MD on
I chuckle 'cos there's nothin'
To waste energy on
There you have it, the uncut raw for rap addicts
Waited three years to see if L still had it
Ten million stars got beef to the deck
End of my contract I'm the last one left
And I look back on Venus
(I look)
I look back on Mars
(And)
And I burn with the fire
(Of ten)
Of ten million stars
(Guess who's back?)
And I look back on Venus
(I look)
I look back on Mars
(And)
And I burn with the fire
(Of ten)
Of ten million stars
L's worth paper dash that damn who put 'em up in that skyscraper
Ask my dogs up in old five who made a major?
L L playa, now who's next to need a paper drop a bomb on?
L's worth paper, dash that damn who put 'em up in that skyscraper
Ask my dogs up in old five who made a major?
L L playa  who's next to need a paper drop a bomb on?
And I look back on Venus
I look back on Venus
(I look)
I look back on Mars
I look back on Mars
And I burn with the fire, of ten million stars
