Murder one on one, the hottest under the sun
I come from under the tummy, bustin' a tommy
Or come from under your garments, yo chest and your arm hit
Pow, one to the head now you know he dead
Now you know I play it, like a pro in the game
Now better yet a veteran a hall of fame
I got that medicine, I'm better than all the names
Ay it's Cash Money Records man a lawless gang
Put some water on the track, Fresh for all his flame
Wear a helmet when you bang it man and guard yo brain
'Cos the flow is spasmatic what they call insane
That ain't even [Incomprehensible] aim I get dough boy
And you already know that pimpin'
18 how I'm livin' young show that Bentley
Stunnin' my Pa so you know that's in me
Got my mentor so don't go there with me
Say go DJ, 'cos that's my DJ
Say go DJ, 'cos that's my DJ

And I move like the Coupe through traffic rush hour
GT Bent' roof is absent, ya girl present wit the music blastin'
And she keep askin' how it shoot if its plastic
I tell her you see if ya boy run up, she said back
And cut the Carter back up, oh fa shoo
Ay Big Mike they better step they authority up
Before they step to a sergeant's son, I got army guns
You boys never harmin' young
Fly Wizzy my opponents done, I'm done talking
And I ain't just begun
I been runnin' my city like Diddy ya chump
 I fly by ya in a foreign whip
On the throttle wit a model bony dic
Pair of phony tits, her hair is long and bland, on to her behind
Well here we go so hold on to my, lets go
Hold on let me hit the
So go, so go
This is the, this is the, this is the
This is the, this is the, this is the
This is the Carter

Bird man put them covers in a trash can
Leave em outside of your door I'm your trash man
I'm steady lightin' another hash and ridin' in my jag
You will need a gas mask man
You snakes, stop hidin' in the grass
Sooner or later I'll cut it knock the blades in yo pants
You [Incomprehensible] got ways like a drag
While the homie here tryin' get paid in advance
I'm stayin' on my grizzy, I'm a bonafide hustler
Play me or play wit me then I'm goin' find your mother
Say they wanna eat 'cos they ain't ate nothin'
But then they wanna leave when you say you out of mustard
So I'ma walk into the restaurant alone
Walking out, leavin' behind just residue and bones
In your residents with [Incomprehensible] to your dome
Like tell me were you holdin' the dough
Holdin' your throat, choke
This, this, this, this, this, this
This, this, this, this, this, this
This, this is the Carter
Say go DJ, 'cos that's my DJ
Say go DJ, 'cos that's my DJ
Say go DJ, 'cos that's my DJ
Say go DJ, 'cos that's my DJ
Go DJ
