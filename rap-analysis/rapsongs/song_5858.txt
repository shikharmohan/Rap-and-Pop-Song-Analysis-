Bass me face me task the tip of a tasty
Bitches are sweet as a pastry
You don't know me homey from a peach or a pony
I'm the only now your lyrics look lonely
Lyrically fortified born I'm immortalized
Lightin' shit up from Wranglers to raw hides
Packed with black positivity and wizardry
I'm my own body and it built for partyin'
I rip hearts apart as if it's my last rap
The Lords abroad and I represent that ass dat
Shows seniority, lays the foundation
Bolos and donuts, oh I built the nation
Keep the faith tastin', keep the touch clutched
Keep your face way away from the rough stuff
If it ain't rough it ain't rugged
Either you are born with none or you're stacked or star-studded
From the intro to end I will flow
And also, yo come let the ho's go
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
(Let the ho's go)
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
Meet my friend Mac 10, sittin' backpacked and mackin'
Thirsty for action, workin' and smackin' the last of the allies
Smoke 'em up shall I or should I? I'm sure to give it a good try
No need for a survival kit, there's none left to fix
They've all been blown into dustbins
Floatin' in space, spinnin' in infinity
Part of the start is the end of any identity
Lost in the source, no cause, so the boss gettin' off
East, the West, the South, break North
You'll bite as my chew, as a guard duckin' a graveyard
Actin' is for actors so you rap but don't you play hard
I got the Mac to wax and I ain't tryin to fall back
I rap like I'm the tops, stay real 'cos I'm all that
It's my way on a highway, forget your friends
'cos I stick that ass like cowboys stickin' a contact lens
Let the ho's go
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
(Let the ho's go)
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
You say you're hittin' hard, huh, I say you're hardly hittin'
I grip ya quick like a pussy in a kitten mitten
I'm gettin' grand and greater, sucker catch ya later
He gettin paid with the fade of a Space Invader
You lookin' moonstruck, fear, start to talkin' tough
Then sayin' "Sorry" like I really give a mother fuck
You're little late, don't you think that was the wrong approach-a?
A sqwuab by the name of Treach is sure to up and smoke ya
At anytime, anywhere, for any wanted cause
I got a double-barreled pump that's sayin', "Give me yours"
Then I'ma dash in a flash, duck and go for cover
'Cos I have one for this robbery and many others
Another gangster, no I'm like an angry ecker
Droppin' you and gettin' mad if you don't say, "Thank yer"
The clip clockin' killers, and plus my county crew
I gotta clutch, I'll clean your life, no not after you
So don't try to hide or apologize
Apologies and go meet a French eyes is wise
So if you know what I mean and have a hop block
And never ever seen a day when the money stops
You gotta put up your fists, just to let me know
Ain't I gotta pump it hard to let the ho's go, let the ho's go
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
(Let the ho's go)
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
Competition on canvas, never have I heard the tongue
Throw a watch at me without it being fuckin hung
Give it a new style, neck him up and keep him learning
Should've had projects in the days of Mississippi Burning
I let her see the white sheet hit the concrete
And see that head go off and down from a thousand feet
'Cos the brother's around me don't even play all that
They see a sheet and a cross, they say "Oh, gimme that"
Hollow wind in Ill town and don't you be a ghost
'Cos you get your broke or even worst smoked
Now this rhyme is regard' lyrically low cold
But it had to have the flow to let the ho's go, let the ho's go
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
(Let the ho's go)
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
