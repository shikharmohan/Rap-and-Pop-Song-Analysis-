[Lil' Wayne:]
Target practice, baby
Only thing is 
I'm not the shooter
I'm the bullet bitch
[Kanye West:]
They say your attitude determines your latitude,
I'm high as a motherfucker, fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't because you love what I make
Now ain't that about a bitch and I'ma talk shit until I'm outta hits
They don't wanna turn they speakers up, they claim I ain't deep enough
All that talkin I feed off of, keep it up
I'm relaxin, my feet is upli
I'm leavin you haters, like when shaq left the lakers,
Just to heat it up
I saved the stats and stunt, I don't need to front
Make black history every day, I don't need a month
The survey says by the streets according
Kanye just as important as michael jordan
Was to the NBA, when he was scoring
Ralph lauren was borin before I wore him and
[Chorus:]
You ain't never gotta ask again,
How we got the world to listen
It ain't easy to pretend,
I know you lost your cool
And you decided how to love again
We can't stop it's just the beginning
You ain't never gotta ask again
Baby this is what we do
[Lil' Wayne:]
Yeah, what you want
And if you strapped we can trade like the Dow Jones 
Wet him up, I hope he got his towel on 
I aim at the moon, and get ma howl on 
Some niggas cry wolf, I'm on that dry cush 
And when it comes to that paper, I stack books 
Yeah, you heard what i said 
I can put you on your feet or put some money on your head 
Life aint cheap 
You're better off dead if you can't pay the fee 
Shoutout ma nigga fee 
See every muthafucka at the door don't get a key 
You outside lookin in, so tell me what you see 
Its about money, it's bigger than me 
I told ma homies don't kill him, bring the nigga to me, yeah
Don't miss, you fuckin with the hitman 
Kidnap a nigga make him feel like a kid again 
[Chorus:]
You ain't never gotta ask again,
How we got the world to listen
It ain't easy to pretend,
I know you lost your cool
And decided how to love again
We can't stop it's just the beginning
You ain't never gotta ask again
Baby this is what we do
[T.I.:]
Now, e'rybody wanna be the king of the South
When they ain't runnin a damn thing but they mouth
No doubt, it's all good, y'all just statin y'all opinion
But in the South and in the hood it's understood without sayin
It's a given, and it ain't because of what I'm doin for a livin
It's more because of what I do and how I'm livin
Not to mention when I'm rappin I'm just hurtin niggaz feelings
And still chillin on somethin that's into healing
Made provisions for the clique to continue keepin it pimpin
Whether crack was in the house or record sales was through the ceiling
So say what you want, and do what you please
But for fun, I shoot 22's from your shoes to your knees
I run a record label and a crew of G's
So, niggas'll come and look for you if ya sneeze
or even breathe the wrong way, you better do what the song say
And be easy, or else it'll be a long day
[Chorus:]
You ain't never gotta ask again,
How we got the world to listen
It ain't been easy to pretend,
I know you lost your cool
And decided how to love again
We can't stop it's just the beginning
You ain't never gotta ask again
Baby this is what we do
[Jay- Z:]
They say an eye for an eye, we both lose our sight,
And two wrongs don't make a right
But when you been wrong and you know all along that it's just one life
At what point does one fight? Good question right
'Fore you knock the war, try to put your dogs in it
Ten-and-a-halfs, for a minute-and-a-half
Bet that stops all the grinnin and the laughs
When you play the game of life and the win ain't in the bag
When your options is none and the pen is all you have
On the block, niggaz standin tight, there's limits on the ave
Tryin to cop or shot-call theyself cleansin in the cash
But can't put they name on paper cause, then you on blast
Mr. President, there's drugs in our residence
Tell me what you want me to do, come break bread with us
Mr. Governor, I swear there's a cover up
(Mr. Governor, I swear there's a cover up)
