We've just played fifteen minutes of commercial free music
Of course you're listening to WRMS FM
And we play nothing but De La slow music
We're comin' up on the hour of ten o'clock
It's a full moon and perfect night for lovers
We're about to do something we don't usually do
And that's, well I'll show you
Hello, hello, who's this? Squirrel, hi listen
I don't have a lot of time, my name's Mizuna
I'm on my dinner break from Burger King and I just called
To tell you that I love your new radio station
I love everything you guys do, thank you
And with that, the next song is just for you and when
You go back tell all the Burger King honeys that if
They want to call and talk to me, just call WRMS, see ya
