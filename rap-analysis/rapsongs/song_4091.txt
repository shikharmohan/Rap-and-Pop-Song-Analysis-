I have no doubt
That I can love you forever
The only trouble is 
You really don't have the time
You've got one night only
One night only thats
One night only
One night only
One night only
One night only thats
She marks her calendar
Reschedule every plan 
She knows when I'm coming 
She's more than a fan
She got my tour dates
She also gotta man
But even hommie gotta understand
She got
One night only 
One night only 
And, no one gon take it from her
Nothins gon make her miss it 
And when I'm gon she'll miss it
Wish she never forget that
One night only 
One night only thats
Next day another city
She's never comin with me
I'm nothin more than memories
Memories she keep forever
She always dream about me
Wish she could sleep forever
She get her fit togehter
She get her shit together
After my concert 
She wanna get together
I get her on my bus
We chill and sit together
She has no curfew 
I can take tha bitch wherever
Come off a bit respectful
I'm on a different level
I got her feelin special
Then she remember she got
One night only 
One night only thats 
One night only
One night only 
One night only 
One night only thats
One night only
One night only
But...I...can make you love me forever..
Baby I can make you love me forever

Now all the hoes hate her
Tha dudes wan date her
Her nigga saw her leave
She deal wit em later
Right now she wit the greatest
I'm even homies favorite
How could he even blame her
She doin him a favor
She let that nigga love her
She let that nigga save her
But when I come she let a nigga take her..take her for
One night only 
One night only
(yeah)
She turnin off her phone
She turnin off her pager
Tell him that shit on roam
That nigga goin in labor
One night only
One night only thats
Des niggas hate the game
But they can't bite the lay up
Then she go home to him
He sicker than a patient
He waitin at the table
No breakfast at the table
He ask her where she been
She say stop trippin it was
One night only
One night only thats
One night only 
One night only
One night only
One night only thats
One night only 
One night only
But I...can...make you love me forever...I... can make you love me forever
Them older bitches jealous
Say shes a groupie whore 
But every women in this world was you before
See everybody wish upon that superstar
But when it come true how true you are
You got your
One night only
One night only 
See I can't be her man
And She can't be my girl
Oh but we fuck like its the end of the world
And we got
One night only 
One night only thats
I got a wife she knows
My wife aint on the road
When she come to my room
She take off all her clothes
Say anything goes
Tomorrow same clothes
We prolly order movies
We prollly lay together
But we can't stay together
Thats when I gotta tell her
I have no doubt
That I can love you forever
The only trouble is 
You really don't have the time
You've got one night only
One night only thats
One night only
One night only
One night only
One night only thats
