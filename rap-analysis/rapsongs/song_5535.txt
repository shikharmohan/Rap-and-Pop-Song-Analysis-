Yeah, oh, yeah
What the fuck you lookin' at, shorty?
You don't want it, lil' nigga
You'se a shooter then shoot, nigga, I'm doin' my thang
If you seen a, my nina, you seen it go bang
Just like they do in your hood, they do it in mines, mayne
I put a hole in a nigga, I ain't motherfuckin' playin'
You'se a shooter then shoot, nigga, I'm doin' my thang
If you seen a, my nina, you seen it go bang
Just like they do in your hood, they do it in mines, mayne
I put a hole in a nigga, I ain't motherfuckin' playin'
You niggaz ain't nuttin' but clown killers, for real
I'm down with the Unit, for the Gorillas, for real
Go bananas if you want, ooh, ooh, you gettin' peeled
Y'all shoot for the shoot, we do this for real
Clap me's a motherfucker, make more mil's
Cash me a check, cop more wheels
Shorty, you a bad bitch, a good ass steel
Now, up upon this dillz an' smeared that lip gloss
Me an' P share bitches like we switch Porsche
My hammer navigate beef, Hummer don't get lost
Boy, that Desert Eagle have that whole shit ripped off
Yeah, we get that gwop 'cause we make shit that pop
Heavy rotation, your shit flop
Won't stop 'til we get to that top
If the gun too far then you will get oxed
Y'all niggaz ain't real, y'all just talk a lot
You'se a shooter then shoot, nigga, I'm doin' my thang
If you seen a, my nina, you seen it go bang
Just like they do in your hood, they do it in mines, mayne
I put a hole in a nigga, I ain't motherfuckin' playin'
You'se a shooter then shoot, nigga, I'm doin' my thang
If you seen a, my nina, you seen it go bang
Just like they do in your hood, they do it in mines, mayne
I put a hole in a nigga, I ain't motherfuckin' playin'
If you a killer then kill somethin', you talkin' all day
Frontin', killin' nuttin', you niggaz is real gay
See me shinin', mad diamonds, now what can I say
I'm a mega star, never thought it'd be this way
Niggaz fightin' for the bottom, I feel your pain
I'm at the top an' I'm never comin' back again
Except for when I come to scoop lil' shorty good brains
Out the hood, you see me in yo' hood, don't play
I open up yo' head an' expose yo' brain
It's not a joke or a game an' I ain't tryin' to advance
My rap lines, please believe what I say
I'm a Mobb nigga, nigga, I do this all day
Hit the weed, hit the gas on the Lamb' to skate
See me comin' through the club, get out of my way
You don't know me, man, get out of my face
'Fore I flip, no shit, you niggaz get sprayed
You'se a shooter then shoot, nigga, I'm doin' my thang
If you seen a, my nina, you seen it go bang
Just like they do in your hood, they do it in mines, mayne
I put a hole in a nigga, I ain't motherfuckin' playin'
You'se a shooter then shoot, nigga, I'm doin' my thang
If you seen a, my nina, you seen it go bang
Just like they do in your hood, they do it in mines, mayne
I put a hole in a nigga, I ain't motherfuckin' playin'
