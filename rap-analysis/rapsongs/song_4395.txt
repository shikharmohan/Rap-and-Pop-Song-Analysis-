Go!
I'm in love with a beauty
She is a cutie
Somebody say they saw us kissin' in da movies
We had a drink or two
We saw Rush Hour Two
Then we went home and we made our own movie
[Chorus:]
Lights Camera Action ya dig?
Lights Camera Action ya dig?
It's showtime, it's showtime, show me yours show you mine
Like OoOoOo it's goin' down in dis bitch
Like a boxer in the first round in dis bitch
1-800 I would dicky down in dis bitch
Uptown in dis bitch don't make a sound in dis shhhhh
Now let me whisper in ya ear every single word your little ear wanna hear
Flip ya body over have no fear
Can I put my tongue here until you tear?
Cry baby cry baby suck ya momma  titty
You know I like dem old I might have yo momma with me
I like your girlfriend and your girlfriendses
Honor my pole like a flag on da end bitch
[Chorus: x2]
Lights Camera Action ya dig?
Lights Camera Action ya dig?
It's showtime, it's showtime, show me yours show you mine
Oh shawty hold on can I holla atcha?
Oh shit! She ain't impressed she know I was a rapper
See I'm da illest motherfucka that could spit forever
God damn that pussy tight than Tiger Woods' sweater
See my sex is greater cause my dick is bigger
I got that cum that you could drink like a 20 liter
So let me come and teach ya
I know you want it deeper
I put some money on that ho like she was a Visa
She catch my ballz in her mouth like a wide receiver
She "Set It Off" on my dick I call her Queen Latifah
She gave ya blow on da low like a bag a reefer
She's a hood diva, so you know it's...
[Chorus: x2]
Lights Camera Action ya dig?
Lights Camera Action ya dig?
It's showtime, it's showtime, show me yours show you mine
I'm like, OoOoOo it's goin' down in dis bitch
Pull off bust a hundred rounds on dis bitch
All my nigga dawgs is dawg pound in dis bitch
And if I ever go down like you betta keep it shhhhhhhh
Cause girl it get no better
Looks sitting right hairy like a wool sweater
Seems like ever since I start stackin cheedar
Putty tat chase me everywhere like Sylvester
Droppin jaws faster than my eyes can undress her
Diggin like a pirate try 'n find the hidden treasure
Hundred pack of rubbers like I'm a try 'n break a record
Baby girl say she buy whatever so it's...
[Chorus: x2]
Lights Camera Action ya dig?
Lights Camera Action ya dig?
It's showtime, it's showtime, show me yours show you mine
