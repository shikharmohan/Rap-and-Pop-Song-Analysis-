You keep bumpin' me against the wall
Yeah, I know I let you slide before
But until you seen me trust
You ain't seen bouncin' back
You keep bumpin' me against the wall
Yeah, I know I let you slide before
But until you seen me trust
You ain't seen bouncin' back
I really be throwin' my words standin' 'em up, and jammin' on the one
That ain't nobody but Neptunes bammin' on the drum
Swift flip kicks landin' from the tongue
More dramatic than Batman and Robin, ba, na, na, na, na, na
The one that be handlin' they business, be sharper than a thumb tack
The one that be droppin' these albums, showin' 'em how to come back
And you gon' respect me and appreciate where I run at
You ain't gone piss me off, 'cuz you sorry that you done that
I gets meaner, badder, stronger and ferocious
You don't even much wanna see the rest
Coming back mo' fearless, mo' determined to fold the set
I ain't even started yet
So if you ain't ready you better get ready
I know I do it better when I'm bein' opposed
Ah, stick ya chest out, keep your chin up
'Cuz sometimes you gotta get knocked down to get up
You keep bumpin' me against the wall
Yeah, I know I let you slide before
But until you seen me trust
You ain't seen bouncin' back
You keep bumpin' me against the wall
Yeah, I know I let you slide before
But until you seen me trust
You ain't seen bouncin' back
No matter what happened that's only once it's shame on you
You come up and here and do it again then it's shame on me
Sometimes we be gettin' in trouble we didn't want learn or
Sometimes we be gettin' in trouble we ain't gon' see
I accept my wages like the way that I feel
I grow, I take 'em in stride and but 'em under my belt
I learned from you just like you learned from me
I plead, I pray for peace and perfect harmony
Somebody said, "Fool you better keep on rappin'
Stop that trippin', 'cuz it ain't gon' happen'"
I told them "Look, you better mind yo business
Change yo' way of thinkin' and keep on livin'"
Done started some trouble and you ain't been out since
'Cuz you stuck inside scared watchin' CNN
Just take the precaution so yo life will be better
Tell my friends to call me I ain't acceptin' no letters
You keep bumpin' me against the wall
Yeah, I know I let you slide before
But until you seen me trust
You ain't seen bouncin' back
You keep bumpin' me against the wall
Yeah, I know I let you slide before
But until you seen me trust
You ain't seen bouncin' back
You heard about, yeah, you had to
I know you changed ya mind
You ain't the only one with bad news
I know that they made you feel strange
You was right in the middle complainin'
And forgot what you was cryin' 'bout
It could be your time and it might be
You can't do nothin' about it
It's God's will, that's just how life be
One day it hit 'cha then it's gone
And I'm serious and you ain't never
Even gone feel it until it hit home
That's when the pain run sharper and deeper
You ain't eatin' that's when the days feel slow and long
I know you miss 'em so it's time to uplift 'em
Try to pick the pieces up and find a way to drive on
I tell you the truth so don't lie to me
Get back Satan don't bother me
And that's the way that it's gotta be
As real as ever, so I hope you proud of me
You keep bumpin' me against the wall
Yeah, I know I let you slide before
But until you seen me trust
You ain't seen bouncin' back
You keep bumpin' me against the wall
Yeah, I know I let you slide before
But until you seen me trust
You ain't seen bouncin' back
You keep bumpin' me against the wall
You keep bumpin' me against the wall
You keep bumpin' me against the wall
You ain't seen bouncin' back
You keep bumpin' me against the wall
You keep bumpin' me against the wall
You keep bumpin' me against the wall
You ain't seen bouncin' back
