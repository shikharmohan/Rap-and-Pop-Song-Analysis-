No sweat, it's no sweat, it's no sweat
Never, never see me sweat
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Tell 'em folk it's no sweat
Naw, no sweat, ay, it's no sweat, it's no sweat
Never let 'em see me sweat
Hey, you can ride with my dimes
She keeps 'em on the way
You say you need that window whir
But blow it away
It's no sweat, it's no sweat
It's no sweat, there's no sweat
(Never let 'em see me sweat)
Hey, I'm the best in the game
Kick it with the best in the game
Ain't no need for me to worry
'Bout the rest of you lames
It's no sweat, it's no sweat
It's no sweat, it's no sweat
Yeah, you can call me the king
They also call me the vet
Haters can call me the reason
Their bitch ain't callin' 'em back
The press be callin' me cocky
I ask 'em what you expect
First album flopped, my label dropped
Man, I took off like a jet
Niggas hate on me often 'cause I'm a boss and exec
Do anything for my family, willing to die for respect
I bet I got it in cash, the same thing you got in a check
Wonder how I got it so fast, baby, you gotta invest
I can be cool to St. Louis, I can be hot as Tibet
For you can get through security, I'd done got on a jet
You must be under a rock if you haven't heard of 'em yet
Paris and Germany be buggin' me, I'm certain to that
Anything my heart desires, I can certainly get
The Ferrari light SV, what its be a convertible, yes
A lotta niggas say they name but I ain't heard of 'em yet
So when I check 'em, they deserve that
Hey, you can ride with my dimes
She keeps 'em on the way
You say you need that window whirr
But blow it away
It's no sweat, it's no sweat
It's no sweat, there's no sweat
(Never let em see me sweat)
Hey, I'm the best in the game
Kick it with the best in the game
Ain't no need for me to worry
'Bout the rest of you lames
It's no sweat, it's no sweat
It's no sweat, it's no sweat
