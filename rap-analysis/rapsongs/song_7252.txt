[Jazze Pha:] 
Ladies and gentlemen, 
You are now tuned in, to the very best 
Phizzle 
T.I. 
Dream 
[Verse 1:] 
Long hair, cute face 
Big booty, thin waste 
Breasts so pretty they can't be real 
They ewww
That's what she'll say 
She'll play 
With her girlfriend, tag team on the sex, I give away 
Get em on patrol, for real they 
Both gon have a field day 
Never had experience 
orgies but they curious 
So gorgeous and mysterious
I'm panty pumpin number one, I'm serious 
I'm talkin fast cars, bright lights 
Big city, long nights 
Pretty women on site 
I give it to em all night 
[Chorus:] 
Bright lights 
Rollin thru the city on that M6 
Heavy on the radio station 
Playin my, oh 
In a minute she gon be rite up on mine 
And look at youu 
She ain't had none in a minute so I'm really finna put it on you 
Just got a text from your man, no he mad, he ain't got a clue 
You know it 
He can't love you like I do 
He can't do it like (I do) 
He can't do it like (I do) 
He can't do it like (I do) 
So go shawty, twirk that, bump it and work that (I do) 
He can't do it like (I do) 
U kno he can't do it like (I do) 
He can't do it like (I do)

[Verse 2:] 
Shawty say she got a man but 
He don't really stand up 
And that stuff that like he supposed to, all he do is handcuff 
So she come see me relax 
Give me love, recieve it back 
Sex her, stetch her body out so much, she say I needed that 
I'm talkin primetime pornstar 
Goin hard goin in 
Ride me like a foreign car 
Invite a friend to join in 
I'm talkin fast cars, bright lights 
Big city, long nights 
Pretty women on site 
I give it to em all night 
[Chorus] 
[Verse 3:] 
Catchm me in the
Old school, new school 
Vert drop, hard top 
See me and at least 2 freaks pulled over in the parkin lot 
Engaged in conversation yo and listenin to the radio 
Give it to em ruff, they say but treat em like a lady tho 
She never kissed a girl b4 
But fantasized bout girls b4 
Imagine havin sex with women, jus don't want the world to kno 
I'm talkin fast cars, bright lights 
Big city, long nights 
Pretty women on site 
I give it to em all night
