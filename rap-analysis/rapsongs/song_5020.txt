If i wasn't rappin'.
I'd probably be wrestling
Hand to hand grappling on the corner of Madison
Or real a stating trying to sell you a mansion
Or rollerblading doing 360 flat-spins
Or I'll probably be flipping a burger
Attempting a murder
 Paralyzed, sipping on Gerber
I could be working at jewels
Chain snatching jerking ya jewels
Homeless working for food
I might be
Cleaning your pool
Teaching your school
Preaching to fool
Leaching, smoking weed to be cool
At DMV's holding lines up
Or wind up in line ups, ya times up
Full of holes & holes ina fine tux
Out on parole
Out of control, holdin ya dime up
I could be last sitting on ya couch
Or I could be crazy cussing pigeons out
I could be hustling bags
Struggling bad, if I wasn't up in the lab
(shit)
I just might be cutting your grass walking your dog
Pumping your gas 
Or nothing at all
I could be hustling bags
Struggling bad, if I wasn't up in the lab
(shit)
I just might be cutting your grass walking your dog
Pumping your gas 
Or nothing at all
