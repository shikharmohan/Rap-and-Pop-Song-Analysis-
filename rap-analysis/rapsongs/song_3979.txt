Now get your back up off the wall
Dance, come on
Now get your back up off the wall
Dance, come on
Now do it
Queen Bee, Bad Boy baby
Let's go
Ready or not, here I come
I'm a Bentley, y'all something like a Hyundai
Win more skins than crack without dunja
Tasty like a sundae
Eat it like a Kit Kat
Be forge a climax, replay back
Lil' Kim records hit the streets
DJs wanna spend that back like
Me and Lil' Cease is the real tag-team
While most of y'all broads is just drag queens
It's gonna take years before you match our cream
And only in your dreams can you see what we see
Now lend me your ear, listen closely
I wear these jewels like a rosary
This is how the rap game is supposed to be
One king, one queen, things supposed to be
Now get your back up off the wall
Dance, come on
Now get your back up off the wall
Dance, come on
Now do it
Niggas lean left, bitches lean right
Come on, you gotta ride 'em, baby
It's the year 2G and things about to change
Trade in that Range, get a motherfuckin' plane
Your girl is lame, what?
Want a bitch like me, what?
If it's diamonds you want, baby I got 'em
Money in a briefcase who needs a wallet?
Be a pigeon nigga you sound retarded
I'm the girl with more cream than St. Patrick's Day
House by the bay so what do you say?
Me and you, nigga like running Roulette
The game is strip poker, is you ready to play?
Make it last all night and I'm ready to stay
Put your money and your jewels up one at a time
And if you lose this game, all this shit is mine
What you got? Full house, triple ace and two kings
Royal flush beats ten jack, here give me, I win, give it up
Now get your back up off the wall
Dance, come on
Now get your back up off the wall
Dance, come on
Now do it
Niggas lean left, bitches lean right
Come on, you gotta ride 'em, baby
When it comes to status, call me Dr. Ruth
I ain't a prostitute, I just speak the truth
Dicks, I like 'em fat like a pickle
Hard like a nickel, juicy like a Popsicle
Niggas mention me for a sexual reference
Lil Kim's everybody's sexual preference
A bitch like me gives it on the first date
Why hesitate? I ain't got time to wait
'Cause y'all know how I get down
Niggas from the East know how I get down
Cats from the West know how I get down
From the North to South say, "Can you get down"
Now lend me your ear, listen closely
I wear these jewels like a rosary
This is how the rap game is supposed to be
One king, one queen, things supposed to be
Now get your back up off the wall
Dance, come on
Now get your back up off the wall
Dance, come on
Now do it
Niggas lean left, bitches lean right
Come on, you gotta ride 'em, baby
Queen Bee, 2000
Get your backs up off the wall
Dance, come on
Dance, come on
Dance, come on
Notorious K.I.M.
J.M., come on
[Incomprehensible], come on
B.I.G. come on, forever come on
Come on
Come on
I see you, yeah
