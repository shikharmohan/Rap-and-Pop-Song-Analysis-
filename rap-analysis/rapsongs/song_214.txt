{Light the fire that needs the air}
Yeah
{I won't burn unless you're there, you're there}
I need you
{Ooh, I need you}
I need you to hate
So I can use you for your anger
{Light the fire that needs the air}
{I won't burn unless you're there, you're there}
You know, it's real ****, feel this!
America got a thing for this gangsta sh** they love me
Black Chucks, black skullies, leather Pelle-Pelle
I take Spit over Raymo, ****, I'ma fan
Got the silver duck tape on my tray eight handle
The women in my life bring confusion ** ****
So like Nino in New Jack, I'll holla
"Cancel that *****!"
Look at me, this is the life I chose
****** around me so cold, man my heart dun froze up
I build the empire on the low
The narc's don't know I'm the weatherman
I take that coca leaf and make that snow
Sit back, watch it turn to dope, watch it go out the do'
O after O, you know
Homey I'm just triple beam, dreamin' ****** be schemin'
I fiend to live the good life the fiends are just fiendin'
Conceal my weapon nice and easy so you can't see
The penitentiary is definitely out the question for me
I want to find the things in my life
So I hustle
***** you get in my way while I'm tryin' to get mine
And I'll **** you
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
N**** f**k you
I want to find the things in my life
So I hustle
Yea, I don't know **** about gymnastics I somersault bricks
Black talons start flyin', when a ***** flip
I cook ***** in the microwave, ****** can't **** with me
Me and my cool G's, call me Chef-boy-are-50
Check my logic, smokers don't like seeds in their **** ****
Send me them seeds, I'll grow them what they need
Them ain't Chia Pet plants in the crib that's chronic
And I'm sellin' them for 500 a pop god damn it
I sell anythin' I'ma hustler, I know how to grind
Step on grapes put it in water and tell you it's wine
If you analyze me, what you will find is the DNA of a crook
And what goes on in my mind
Is contagious, hypnotic, it sounds melodic
If rap was the block or spider, I'll be poke and product
Now get a load of me, flashy, far from low key
And you can locate me wherever that dope be
Be gettin' money man
I want to find the things in my life
So I hustle
***** you get in my way while I'm tryin' to get mine
And I'll **** you
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
N***** f**k you
I want to find the things in my life
So I hustle
It's a hustler's ambition
Close your eyes listen, see my vision
Mossberg pumpin', ******* dumpin' and drama means nothin'
It's part of the game, catch me in the coupe switchin' lanes
Or in the jeweler's switchin' chains
I upgrade from 30 BS to clean VS
Rocks that I copped from proceeds from the spot
I got the energy to win, I'm full of adrenaline
Play the curve and get nauseous, watchin' the spinner spin
I make plans to make it, a prisoner of the state
Now I can invite yo' ass out to my estate
Them ****** tips bent me up, but I'm back in shape
Pour Cristal in the blender and make a protein shake
I'm like the east coast number one Playboy B
Hugh Hefner'll tell you he ain't got sh** on me
The Feds watch me, Icey they can't stop me
Racist, pointin' at me, "Look at *****race"
