Sip somethin'
Come on, sip somethin'
Sip somethin'
I wouldn't drink that
If I was you
With every sip of my drink, I get a little bit closer
And when I'm tryin' to rethink I can't really get focused
I wasn't try to be mean, I can see that it's hopeless
'Cause your persistence overpowers me I know you rollin' out with me
I was stayin' at the Shore Club, leanin' in the red room
Seen this Tan Mami, she was fresh off the sand dunes
Big bottles and models and poom-pooms
Surroundin' my table, watchin' me like cable
My Dolce hat was low, Versace shades
Had the Prada shoes on 'cause the world is a stage
Lah lah in the air, it's a sky bar affair
The glamorous life, I had my glass in the air
When my eyes connected with somethin' real real nice
Like she finished her drink and started chewin' on my ice
Her smile was bananas, teeth was pearly white
That's when I realized it'll be a long night
The vibe was right, she was laced in all white
Her French manicure traced the crown on my mic
You ever try to focus, resist with all your might
But every sip you take, pulls you deeper in the hype
With every sip of my drink, I get a little bit closer
And when I'm tryin' to rethink I can't really get focused
I'd try to be mean, I can see that it's hopeless
'Cause your persistence overpowers me I know you rollin' out with me
I'm talkin' tan lines, belly rings and things
DJ rubbin' my thing, makin' my head swing
All the honies was schemin'
'Cause the rocks in my ears was gleamin', oh God I must be dreamin'
My vision was blurry, the party was rockin'
The tools was knockin', honey wanna get it poppin'
Try my best to chill, she was fresh out of Brazil
People was walkin' by makin' our drinks filled
What would you do, if you was a Don?
In a position to wild out with a Brazilian blonde?
Or maybe you a honey and it's hard to keep calm
'Cause you sippin' on somethin' and homeboy's the bomb
You dancin' in your seat, and singin' along
And every sip makes you feel like you need to perform
The party is packed, it's just a little too warm
But you take another sip to prove that you strong
With every sip of my drink, I get a little bit closer
And when I'm tryin' to rethink I can't really get focused
I wasn't try to be mean, I can see that it's hopeless
'Cause your persistence overpowers me I know you rollin' out with me
I can't call it, I can't tell honestly, I'm drunk as hell
And me, I can not believe this night out is windin' down
You keep buyin' all these rounds for me
I know what you want from me
With every sip of my drink, I get a little bit closer
And when I'm tryin' to rethink I can't really get focused
I wasn't try to be mean, I can see that it's hopeless
'Cause your persistence overpowers me I know you rollin' out with me
With every sip of my drink, I get a little bit closer
And when I'm tryin' to rethink I can't really get focused
I wasn't try to be mean, I can see that it's hopeless
'Cause your persistence overpowers me I know you rollin' out with me
Roll out, roll out
Roll out, roll out
Roll out, roll out
Roll out, roll out
Yeah
Yo Timbo bar's on you baby
Yeah
