LUDA!!! Damn It
(Verse 1)
Now before my nigga Jeezy made this song for the city
Before Wayne put out A Milli and in a week he sold a milli
Before JD threw ten thousand on the floor in magic city
Before Usher jumped a room,before he confessed that shit to Chilli
Before DJ Drama dropped a Southern gangster relli (x3)
Before Puff Daddy changed his fucking name to Diddy
Before Janet Jackson went on the tube and showed her titty
I been repping for Atlanta and I been rollin like the 60's
You can ask Dallas Austin you can ask Rico Wade
I kept the lights on in Atlanta when Goody and Cash took a break
And you can say that he this and you can say that he that
But one things for damn sure I put the city on my back
And i aint goin no where that movie money aint changed 'em
But the vaults were to small at the bank so i rearranged 'em
These rappers around my way aint got more money than me
I'm blinded by my own ice but I got more money to see
And I aint dissing I'm just spitting what I call is the truth
So catch me ridding without that thing you call is a roof
I got that money in my palms like i called the mallouse
cuz I gotta make myself clear just like a bottle of Goose
And i can see right through ya
Dont let the mike fool ya
Say the wrong words and my click might do ya
So before you go running yo mouth and say some shit you regret
Well this is just a small verse so that these boys know i dont forget
I put on
(Verse 2)
I balled hard on my 1st album and i ball harder today
Plus I just opened up a resturant in the heart of the A
I paid my dues in my city I'm throwing the finger to all the haters
Me and the mayor just bought back the Martin Luther King papers
Now how hard is that shit how much harder can that get
Hard as th A.R will make these niggas do a backflip
Watch it in Atlanta cause I'm all over your girl
First nigga with a Polow beat I pimped all over the world
First to put on Cash Money when they came to the A
Shout out to my nigga pool like Shaw..shh...SHAWTY!!
From the Goon squads to the shottas
Dope boys to the Rastas
Luda represent this shit from college park to the oscars
Put on a tuxedo get incognito
Got game for your bitch i shoot it like a torpedo
So before you go running yo mouth and say some shit you regret
Well this is just a little verse so that these boys dont forget
I put on
