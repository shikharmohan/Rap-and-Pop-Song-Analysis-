Right, right, right
Right, Busta Rhymes exclusive with the Zhane
Each and every day we gonna come around
Your way and do it our way, word is bond
It's a party, let's get it on tonight
That's how we flow
Gonna rock your body
We gonna do it right
When I step up in the party won't you move it to the left
Party people move it side to side I'm feelin' kind of blessed
And I'm so fly and you're so fly
Feeling high tonight it's a party
Let me get down, do my thing
I always bring, shit that always make your ass swing
Holding down the fort while we keep shit tight
Hit you with that bang shit that keep you live all night
Makin' moves strong while we keep rockin' on
Now the object is survival son so get your hustle on
Bust two shots while I blow up the spot
I make it hot, till the jam is packed, to the parking lot, now
Me and my mans feel like we astronauts
'Cause we so high from off that weed we got from new knots
Certified stimulation got me open wide
Before we slide to side we grab the stash out the ride
We on fire tonight and the place is lookin' steamy
Baby girl let me seek that gift that make your cake creamy
Feel the heat circulatin' through your body
Every time the Flip mode click step inside the part, word is bond
It's a party, let's get it on tonight
That's how we flow
Gonna rock your body
We gonna do it right
The stimulation circulating through my mind, body and soul
Busta Rhymes, stimuli, making me lose control
And I'm so fly and you're so fly
Feeling high tonight it's a party
I got my mind made up, c'mon you can get it girl
Come with me if you really wit' it girl
Back to my dungeon shack, where the party is it
Where I can tickle your nipples and your feminine fat
I checks for you baby whatchu gonna do
There's a party at my crib designed just for me and you
Let me let my crew know we bout to break out
Flip, Star, Web, Dukwon Allah, and the Boy Scout
My man Black Missin', son whylin' with the shorty flippin'
Stackin' papers, sippin' bubbles good nigga livin'
But anyway we bout to break out in my Lands
Pursuin' our thoughts and executin' all plans
The dope shit is that we both understand
That it's a one night stand
And you ain't even thinkin' bout your man
Ooh, we bout to turn on the heat again
Don't you say a word until we finish partyin'
Don't you know that tonight, is your night
Feelin' good when I have a peace of mind
Got to set it off and just a little bit wild
