You doin' ho activities with ho tendencies
Hos are your friends, hoes are your enemies
With ho energy to do whacha do
Blew whacha blew, screw whacha screw
Y'all professional like DJ Clue, pullin' on my coat tail
And why do you think you take a ho to a hotel?
Hotel, everybody, even the mayor
Reach up in tha sky for tha hozone laya
Come on, playa, once a ho always
And hos never close they open like hallways
And here's a ho cake for you, whole ho crew
And everybody wants some 'cause hoes gotta eat too

Can't turn a ho into a housewife
Hos don't act right
There's hos on a mission
And hoes on a crack-pipe
Hey, ho, how ya doin', where ya been?
Prolly doin' ho stuff 'cause there you ho again
It's a ho wide world that we livin' in
Feline, feminine, fantastical women
Not all, just some
You ho, who you are
There's hoes in tha room, there's hoes in tha car
There's hoes on stage, there's hoes by tha bar
Hos by near and hos by far

You gotta run in your pantyhose, even your daddy knows
That you suckin' down chocolate like daddy-o's
You hos are horrible, horrendous
On taxes ya'll writin' off hos as dependents
I see tha ho risin', it ain't surprisin'
It's just a hoasis with ugly chicks faces
But hos don't feel so sad and blue
'Cause most of us niggaz is hos too
