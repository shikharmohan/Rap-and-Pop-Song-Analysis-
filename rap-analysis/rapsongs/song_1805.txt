Let's get it on
We don't give a what, what
We don't give a what, what
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
You don't wanna party then your ass gotta go
You don't wanna party then your ass gotta go
Now you can ride to this motherfucker
Bounce to this motherfucker
Freak to this motherfucker
Let's get it on
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
Once again it's the darker nigga, hit or spark a nigga
Break apart a nigga but the dog is bigger, under stress
So unless you're wanting to bless to the chest
These slugs from his liver rest, rest
Or the pump'll put a hurt on a nigga
Dumd sex, motherfucker feeding dirt on a nigga
My hands stay dirty, 'cause I play dirty the mob way
You don't know? Fuck it find out the hard way
A nigga's job is never done, I handle my business how it come
And there's never been a one on one
Nor has there been a problem, I dissolve them
I'm like salt, lock it up, hate to fall but never wreck his car
And it's my fault, keep niggaz on point ducking down
Niggaz like you need to get bust you fucking clown
I extort to support my peeps
And hold down the fort, never get caught 'cause I creeps, nigga
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
You don't wanna party then your ass gotta go
You don't wanna party then your ass gotta go
Now you can ride to this motherfucker
Bounce to this motherfucker
Freak to this motherfucker
Let's get it on
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
I'm at the crossroads, look but I'm not really sure which way to go
Should I play that low for what I did the other day
They on their way to float, got me striking this random
I can't stand 'em, fake ass niggaz want to be the Phantom
Looking over my shoulder, 'cause it's colder than it was
And start shorty, because I'm a little older than 'cause
And the buzz from the saw, with the chain to your brain
Will turn that BIG NIGGA to a fucking stain
That pain from the dirt makes the hurt go away for a minute
But I'm gon' die by it 'cause I'm like knee deep in it
And you motherfuckers wonder why I start shit
'Cause when you look in my face you see that hard shit
'Cause I done been to hell and back I ain't wit selling crack
I'd rather rob a nigga leave him wit' a shell up in his back
On the real just to show proof, hit the G.W.B.
And blow the whole roof off the toll booth bitch ass nigga
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
You don't wanna party then your ass gotta go
You don't wanna party then your ass gotta go
Now you can ride to this motherfucker
Bounce to this motherfucker
Freak to this motherfucker
Let's get it on
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
When I crawl, leave a nigga sprawled out after I spoke 'em
I'll slit his throat, dick in the mud and let his blood choke 'em
Up north niggaz get the pick stuck up in 'em
And in the streets bitches get the dick stuck up in 'em
My M.O. is man-slaughter kid
'Cause on the reals I done wet up more motherfuckers than water did
Slid, 'cause I got to slide when the dirt is done
A homicide but they want me on the Murder 1
But as long as I got my gun, I'm aight
Stay outta sight while it's light, and then come out at night
To make moves again, stomp and bruise again
I know I'm going to hell 'cause I choose to sin
All my motherfucking life I been the devil's advocate
Now niggaz never even knew the devil had a kid
But he does and when you hear the buzz of the chainsaw
You'll know what I'll split your motherfucking brains for
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
You don't wanna party then your ass gotta go
You don't wanna party then your ass gotta go
Now you can ride to this motherfucker
Bounce to this motherfucker
Freak to this motherfucker
Let's get it on
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor
Don't start nothin', it won't be nothin'
Don't start nothin', it won't be nothin'
You wanna start somethin' it's gon' be somethin'
You wanna start somethin', it's gon be somethin'
Don't start nothin', it won't be nothin'
Don't start nothin', it won't be nothin'
You wanna start somethin', it's gon be somethin'
You wanna start somethin', it's gon be somethin'
Yo yo, c'mon
