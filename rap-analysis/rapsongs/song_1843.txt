The instant they start to catch feelings

Then I'm out just like a thief in the night

You thinkin life, I'm thinkin more like - whassup tonight? 
Come on ma, you know I got a wife
And even though that pussy tight I'm not gon' jeapordize my life (aight? )
So what is it you want from a nigga? (what? )

Chorus (w/ minor variations)
[dmx]
Aiyyo, I think about when a nigga didn't have (yeah)
And a nigga told a joke, and the bitches didn't laugh
See now I do the math, I see if you got this
And this and this to some cats, that nigga's the shit (aight? )
And that's all they fuckin with, but see these bitches don't know
If these bitches ain't for real, these bitches don't go
Knock on door, no show, I'm sleep tryin to creep
Wit yo' best friend, put it in, dig deep
[sisqo - singing over dub chorus]
