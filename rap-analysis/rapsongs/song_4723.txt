It's for the ghetto
For the ghetto for the ghetto
It's for the ghetto man it's for the ghetto
It's for the ghetto it's for the ghetto
It's for the ghetto man it's for the ghetto
Leanin' dipped in rocks pump the joint on the block
Behind the Dolce Gabbana shades peepin' the spots
Frostbit and I'm turnin' blue that's why I'm so hot
Put the hustle down majorly and never get knocked
Who can grind for this? Momma taught me to swerve
Rent the presidential suite out snatch ya bird
My motto is do or die peace sign in the sky
In the brand new electric blue Bentley ridin' by
Hurt these clowns anybody that want it
Let you borrow my crown tell me why would you flaunt it?
Don't you know you can get it have your wig piece splitted
Meth asked me to spit it see my coupes is kitted
And my minks is fitted lyrically I'm Siddick
Honey frontin' when you around I always hit it
The boss is home regulatin' on chrome
Tell Russell it's line one 'Hello' on the phone
Get off my niggy niggy nuts
Get off my niggy niggy nuts
Get off my niggy niggy nuts
Get them niggy nuts now here's wiggy what
Y'all need to do when I come through give it up
Paper stackin' Daddy get it crackin'
Chains might be gold the joints always platinum
And rims always chrome jeans always pressed
Loot always right cut always fresh
Gear always dipped honey always bangin'
You hot? Always my niggy nuts always hangin'
Hold it down rocks by the pound
The new 2002 B boy sound
Hoes stand back I'm shakin' up the game
You shoulda never tried to slide in my lane
Guaranteed to blow the block up
When I ease this milky white drop up
Wanna bang you that's all you need to know
Fifty deep in summer jam I closed the show
Get off my niggy niggy nuts
Get off my niggy niggy nuts
Get off my niggy niggy nuts
Nuts y'all baby stay flowin'
Hit big B tell him bring the mo' in
We rockin' to the rhythm
Uncut raw what we give 'em
Hell yes bounce to the music
When the joint come on everybody lose this
Lead a bar hit the floor
Represent let these clowns know who you are?
When it's bangin' like this why stop?
Ask me why I pop Cris'? Why not?
The flow of the century
Got your Belve splashin' to the melody what you tellin' me?
This is fresh til the day I die
Leavin' momma with a tear in her eye
You was frontin' for a minute now what?
You snapped when the joint dropped
Get off my niggy niggy nuts
Get off my niggy niggy nuts
Get off my niggy niggy nuts
Get off my niggy niggy nuts
Get off my niggy niggy nuts
Get off my niggy niggy nuts
