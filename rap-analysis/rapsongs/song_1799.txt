Just 'cause I love my niggaz, Ruff Ryders
I shed blood for my niggaz, Ryde or die
Let a nigga holla, "Where my niggaz?"
Get down or lay down
All I wanna hear is, "Right here, my nigga"
We here, nigga
You won't take this from me, baby
You will not take this from me, baby, ya know
My niggaz, some niggaz that you don't wanna try
My niggaz, some niggaz that's really do or die
My niggaz will have you cowards ready to cry
My niggaz will fry, my niggaz will rob
My niggaz keep niggaz on they fuckin' job
My niggaz know what it's like when shit gettin' hard
My niggaz stay pullin' you other niggaz cards
My niggaz, it's God, my niggaz, we'll shine
My niggaz, just knew it was a matter of time
My niggaz let me know to keep fuckin' with the rhymes
My niggaz ain't no longer livin' with crime
My niggaz is fine, my niggaz is good
My niggaz keep you niggaz knockin' on wood
My niggaz know how to take it back to the hood
My niggaz will put you down right where you stood
My niggaz, they could, my niggaz, they will
My niggaz take you straight to the back an' get ill
My niggaz give it straight to the bank when we kill
My niggaz put niggaz on ice 'til they chill
My niggaz is still my niggaz is dogs, my niggaz
