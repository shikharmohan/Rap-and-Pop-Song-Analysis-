I'm from a place where fish was made
Corduroy Bailey's, sportin' those Rakim caves
Rakim came, high self esteem promised me
A moment in life, just to wreck y'all lames
Throw the Tech to your brain, puttin' the best to shame
This is Theodore, best to tuck those Dana Dane's
See me comin', start runnin' and
Aiyo
Who them fly niggaz when we walk through the party
Pimp talk with the Mac strapped to our body
Bartender's nervous, afraid to serve us, bad service
Unsmacked him on purpose and see this drunk come and burp us
Paper chasers, Starkey stayed up in the makings
Theodore conquer the four devils with the patience
Cellphones is blowin', the crews not available
Ask Donna, word in the town, we the realest dudes
We don't need no diamonds rings
All we need is a drum, like, fuck it, he can rhyme, I'll sing
And in my Yankee hat, you can drop five beans
And then run back to momma, like, all I know is
Holla holla holla, if you want to, I love you
  (I want you)
Holla holla holla, if you want to, I love you
  (I want you)
When I walk through any function
You bet your ass that the 4 5'll cook
Fuck your wack looks, fuck platinum
Fuck, let me show y'all crooks
This is legit rap, I.R.S. can suck my books
I'm a family man, Clan mixed with Theodore
My boots hang over the telephone wires on Broad
Word to MetLife, Tony got insurance on his mics
Smoke mad shit and still got endurance when he fight
Both hands clusty, bank account dusty
Ever, say, my name, again, you pussy
Like, an angry, cripple, man, don't push me
Don't believe the kid, listen to me
Holla holla holla, if you want to, I love you
  (I want you)
Holla holla holla, if you want to, I love you
  (I want you)
Dirty told me to rock the spot
Freak the beats 'cuz the streets is raw
Don't believe what you see, just watch
Speak to the seeds, give 'em lead on jobs
Educate, keep it peace with Gods
In return, happiness in globs
We see the future like a psychic's palm
The things I'm saying are true
And the way I explain them to you
Yes to you, listen to me
Holla holla holla, if you want to, I love you
  (I want you)
Holla holla holla, if you want to, I love you
  (I want you)
