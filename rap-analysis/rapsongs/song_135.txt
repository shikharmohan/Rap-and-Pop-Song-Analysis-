I can hear your heartbeat, your scared, yeah yeah
I can hear your heartbeat, your scared (x2)
You see, I'm a psycho, a sicko, I'm crazy
I see, I come at night, boy, I kill you, you make me
They wanna see me shot up, locked up and cage me
I'll come back bigger, stronger and angry
[50 cent]
Look look, I've come from a different crew
You fuck with me, I'll get to you
A clip or two, I'll cripple you
'cause I ain't got shit to do
Pistol poppin, a pussy drop
Drama never ever stop
Eenie meenie miney moe
Now try pow a 44
Pick a strap to take the mag
To hold and stab it in your back
I'll blow your brain, I know your name
And where you rest, I'll make a mess
The holla tipsy in ch-chest
Call for blood to EMS
Come pick you up
You know you fucked when
You get on a strecher
'cause I'll come in to ICU
To see you off to heaven
The system out I done been through
There's nothing new to me
They locked me up they let me out
You seen this in the movies
The criminals be criminals
Why they up in corrections
They come home get at 9
and commit crime to perfection
It's murder when they found the gun now they doing ballistics
But they can't find a fingerprint the shit's going terrific
He's so close to your target that it's really hard to miss it
You see, I'm a psycho, a sicko, I'm crazy
I see, I come at night, boy, I kill you, you make me
They wanna see me shot up, locked up and cage me
I'll come back bigger, stronger and angry

Man these are average raps
You keepin the savage batch hidden
The can of whoop ass what the shady aftermath did
You pop off the top its like open and vats of acid
Beat the octamom to death with a cabbage patch kid
Attack a snatch ya theres something to jack a bad chin
Impregnate and shoot up the embryo sack with mack 10s
Triplets quadruplets and a couple of back to back twins
That fetus is fallin out all over jack is back again
The rippers at your service
Girl I can see that your nervous
But I barely scratch the surface
Like my last batch of girlfriends
That I buried in my fuckin backyard
Still trying to dig their way out
I foam like an attack dog, how late you wanna stay out
Its past your curfew when its dark
Im searchin for you in the park
Shady murdered him another virgin he just hit his mark
He met his quota for the month
They found a coat all rolled up
Inside a bag he probably dragged the body for about a block
Disappeared without a trace
No DNA no not a drop
Cause me and dre and 50 we will never get caught by the cops
CSI they hate us but they gotta give alot of props
The drama pops
Grab the butcher knife from off the counter top
You see, I'm a psycho, a sicko, I'm crazy
I see, I come at night, boy, I kill you, you make me
They wanna see me shot up, locked up and cage me
I'll come back bigger, stronger and angry
[Eminem]
Im as ill as can be,
My pill is to serial killer as what a pill is to me
Killing so villianously, still as minical on the niquil, as psycho as michael myers
You know what weÃÂ¢€re like on the motherfuckin mic, so try us
And youÃÂ¢€re goin to find out what the fuck weÃÂ¢€re like with pliers
[50 Cent]
Its operation time, they got him hooked up to wires
Squeezin, he bleedin, he weezin breathin, he half dead
He musnt know, but know he know, how shady aftermath is
Even murderous tactics, get better with practice
Lead showers, gun powder
Feel the talons, Burn burn
Jewel of arts, Juliard, you better, learn learn
[Eminem]
Chris reeves, in his grave, ya homie, turn turn
Im the debating, utilating the lady
You been waiting for shady and Fifth
Aint no duplicating it baby
ThereÃÂ¢€s a baby in the dryer, thereÃÂ¢€s a torso in the washer
I think it might even belong to Porsha when I tossed her
Arms and legs in the garabge cuz the rest of her I lost her
Her head is in the disposal with JessicaÃÂ¢€s, I squashed her
And put her through the ringer and hung her over the wash tub
[50 Cent]
When im through with Ricky, itÃÂ¢€ll be blood thatÃÂ¢€ll cough up
A hard rock, or softer, get caught up, and get washed up
In detroit im awful
When is this ship is nauseous
Look deep in my eyes
See, many many many men die
I swing gym stars faster than samuri
You see, I'm a psycho, a sicko, I'm crazy
I see, I come at night, boy, I kill you, you make me
They wanna see me shot up, locked up and cage me
I'll come back bigger, stronger and angry
