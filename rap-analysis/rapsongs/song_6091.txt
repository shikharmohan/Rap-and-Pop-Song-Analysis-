Li-li-live from New York, li-li-live from New York
Is you watchin' what's on my motherfuckin' neck, nigga?
Li-li-live from New York, li-li-live from New York
Live from New York
Yo, yo, all white bolon, the allie pulled on
Kept his fade low, rocked swade in the snow
Blue Tahoe, a wizard on the keyboard
Eyes look bloodshot, Lord, nevermind that, climb the award
In the system we just missed 'em
Came through bangin' nuthin but Wu, the crowd blitzed 'em
Much love, autograph carryin' the Champaigne glasses
Crazy asses, niggas on his neck like ski masks
Chill steppin' the axe, slash through a little fifty an' crash
I wanna drink, knew she'd pocket the cash
Buck Samonite hype nigga, Iron Man blowin' the mic
You motherfuckin' right, live highlight
Then I seen him, nigga was raw, stepped in
Bitches flexin' next to him, bad Mexicans
What up? Showin' you love, you got a real style
Where you from? The Ow, that's Staten Isle, love no doubt
Oh, God, he had a take 'bout a hundred
Some strange nigga think he had arranged, God gone blunted
Pay attention, it's cinch like sacks an' macks
He did the knowledge, ran to the bar an' grabbed stacks
Now the whole parties bubblin', niggas got love in his bug
He had on one glove, rollin' up drugs
Him an' his Vikings ran through, stopped played the back
Then they walked through, live from New York when niggas hug you
Gettin' money an' laced up, live from New York
Gettin' reefer to blaze up, live from New York
Gettin' niggas to dance, aiyyo an' throw both hands up
Won't pull their pants up, live from New York
Gettin' money an' laced up, live from New York
Gettin' reefer to blaze up, live from New York
Gettin' niggas to dance, aiyyo an' throw both hands up
Won't pull their pants up, live from New York
Yo, yo, Madonna money in our pocket, boatin' in a rocket
'Bout to blast off, we charged like the socket
Whips be cleaner than a fuck, jewels basically struck
Strait up Brolox style, layin' in the cut
Bottles strictly done, ring the alarm
Rollie on the arm, arms crossed, two sneakers on
Fly shit, Nikes the majority
NYC state of mind an' we talk with authority
5 borrows is sterile, still out of town playin' mellow
I thought I seen Shalon swade yellow
Rippin' it, new six flippin' it, shorty is drip dippin' in it
When she sit through dick in it
Came to conclusions, what's the solution when your losin'?
Respect mine now from the foul line
Streets is a part of us, teachin' the seeds through the heart of us
Some get locked, that's a scar on us
Gettin' money an' laced up, live from New York
Gettin' reefer to blaze up, live from New York
Gettin' niggas to dance, aiyyo an' throw both hands up
Won't pull their pants up, live from New York
Gettin' money an' laced up, live from New York
Gettin' reefer to blaze up, live from New York
Gettin' niggas to dance, aiyyo an' throw both hands up
Won't pull their pants up, live from New York
Gettin' money an' laced up, live from New York
Gettin' reefer to blaze up, live from New York
Gettin' niggas to dance, aiyyo an' throw both hands up
Won't pull their pants up, live from New York
