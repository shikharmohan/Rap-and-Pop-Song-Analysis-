Bring it to these niggas son
Yeah, it's that war shit
It's that war shit
[Incomprehensible]
And you know what Dun
It makes you sick to hear the Mobb bang like this
Infamous for the world to hate or play this
Don't give a fuck if you can't rock with this
My dun's heads bop to this, we stand out like a tourist
And make more noise than them other rap niggas
No gimmicks, just pure adrenaline
Raw lyrics, incredible beats, don't mean to rub it in
But you're small time, beneath our feet
Straight ass cheeks, niggas be askin' for ass whippings
Guns kick like Pelle, my big shit be jumping like Jordan
Often lay a man down on the floor, when it gets like that
I'm not blowing off rounds, so you can hear sounds
So you can run back, actin' like you a vet
And swearin' you dead, you survived some real shit
Now what's this? It's not going down like this
Ground that nigga like punishment
Dumpin' out full clips when we dumb out
Though I'd rather do music and chill the fuck out
Dun you bugged out, I'm trying to walk a peaceful route
But niggas always got mouth 'til that piece come out
And niggas always gonna think something sweet
Until they least expect you bringing action exactly
It be the guns, money, pussy, cars
Drugs, jewels, clothes, brawls, killings
Boroughs, buildings, diseases, stress
In these N.Y.C
I say guns, money, pussy, cars
Drugs, jewels, clothes, brawls, killings
Boroughs, buildings, diseases, stress
In these N.Y.C
Feel the gat blow while your shit rips
My shit'll hit while you lettin' niggas go
So you can lower the wrist
That'll only put odds against any attempt
Any provoke uprise, you ain't got it in you
First of all, you too soft for fastball
Point game track, y'all merk like a jaguar nascar
And be out Buck 80 on the slow mar
Hennesy spillin' all over my radar
Stay charged, niggas getting amped off the Mobb shit
Have you wildin' out on some club shit
Fit to make you dance at the same time, stop and glance
Slap flames out the nigga with the wrong idea
Young niggas, young minds, but that quite contraire
Young niggas, smart niggas, who started from the stairs
How dare, you try to come around the way?
In fear like a nigga that been there for years
Shout words that we live, but don't play with it
'Cause when the shit go down, you be like they did it
It be the guns, money, pussy, cars
Drugs, jewels, clothes, brawls, killings
Boroughs, buildings, diseases, stress
In these N.Y.C
I say guns, money, pussy, cars
Drugs, jewels, clothes, brawls, killings
Boroughs, buildings, diseases, stress

Taste test this, military shit, bitches love this
They mans wanna dub this, thugness
It ain't easy to find, shit like mine
I'm a rare species, you're a dime a gross
That's a dozen heist the least, keep silence the most
Regulate with the rest of my establishment
Blast out the pockets of coke, make the cops boat
I break down your whole background yo
Irons, a permanent flesh, your clothes soakin'
You feel the shot pain every heartbeat throbbin'
Don't get excited, you'll only make it worse fighting
Spent most of my nights graveyard shifting
Make burial grounds, be that man, grim reaper
With all pleasure, pick his feet up, pick the heat up
Let's do it like the crematory
Make it hot, make the temperature rise like mercury
When I feel like getting' bent
Yo don't fuck with it Dun
I'm a drink away the pain until the brain get numb
Can't take all my dogs getting lost in the fog
Never to return, I guess they heard God's call
And nature don't surprise me now
Prepare for the worst, and never believe the silver line clouds
Scrutinize crowds, my surroundings
Get suspect, we start four-poundin' shit
Picture me up in the mix
With the next man broke and is on my dick
A good man of plenty, but an enemy, it was clear
I just be another problem, that he feenin' to fix
But I can't have that, pull out, I try to grab that
Caught one nigga's like Mahadat
Guns, money, pussy, cars
Drugs, jewels, clothes, brawls, killings
Boroughs, buildings, diseases, stress
In these N.Y.C
I say guns, money, pussy, cars
Drugs, jewels, clothes, brawls, killings
Boroughs, buildings, diseases, stress
In these N.Y.C
I say guns, money, pussy, cars
Drugs, jewels, clothes, brawls, killings
Boroughs, buildings, diseases, stress
In these N.Y.C
Tonight we gon' get this party early
So let's get it right
