Let's get it hype, nigga
Let's get it crump
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Pass me them swisher sweets, let's get it crump
If a nigga disrespect me I'mma prove my shit and dump
Blast ryhmes like I pump, turn your belly to jelly
Veteran MC, I don't think you rookies is ready
Three hundred and fifty pounds of pressure to deal wit
I run with suave, always packin' something to kill with
Feel this bitch, when I get rich I'mma still hustle
Go down in history, paper taller then Bill Russel
Kilo flows, I got 'em hid in the basement
Choppin' boys up, on some puttin' it in they face shit
Eightball, F A T M A C K, known for layin' it down
And doin' shit the playa way
Callabo's of the dough ain't no secret
Space age pimpin' means I don't do free shit
Time waits for no one, it ain't gon' wait for me
Yours truly, signed Eightball and MJG

'Cuz I'm no nigga like love before
Make bitch scream like, gimme some more
If a nigga broke, what'd you fuck him for?
Waste of time, it's like we playette minds

I'm the pimp motherfucker, baby
Ice cold, stories so high I pimp the whole village twice
So tight fold crease right on the President's nose
Pimp clothes, drinkin' straight Henney'and Buckstrum
Touch toed, hoes, take a centerfold pose
Break a treat, make 'em pay to enter those pros
Slam those, game tied tight like bows
We never close three sixty five, twenty four
Hand chose bitches, a la mode, gettin' sold
Plus a load of killer ass, chronic gettin' blowed
Keep it froze, tucked up in a Tupperware bowl
Stick of gold, somethin' from the school of the old
Forever flows, I take it down as deep as it can go
Burn rolls, braids tight, blazed afros
With pussy hoes, dicks get erect like poles
Pay the toll MJG is in control

My real thug ass niggas, what you wanna do?
All my money makin' bitches if you ride with me
I'mma pimp 'til I die and I'mma ride for free

Pimp dis', you and them boys need to slow down
Up in the mornin' in the court, it's 'bout to go down
There's no remorse now, better explore 'round
Them jackets be on the lose until the dope is found
Juvenile's my name, bitch
I represent it to the end, the same shit
Niggers don't be wearin' suits on these blocks
All you see is your boys and Reeboks
A thin hat to the back with a strap too
Willin' to bust a nigga ass if he had to
If you feel the same my nigger, you's a hot boy
Blocka, blocka, blocka, better get up off the block, boy
Call for the cops, boy your mommy or pops, boy
Cash wasn't a million, never hit the spot boy
You want props ha, you sold to the cops ha
You in a cell block ha, 'cuz you too hot ha
