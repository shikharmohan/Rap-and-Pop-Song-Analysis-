Chrous:
That's the call of my thugs 
When they step up in the club they go yee
When you hit the prison bricks from Vallejo or the rich they holla yee
You can catch me in the traffic in the cutlass or the maverick hollarin' yee
If its lookin' like some static we gonna bust them automatics like yee
My area code grows some of the best weed in the world 
My ninja we aint no punk
They say we need to take a bath in tomato juice 
Cause we always smell like skunk
Sloppy drunk nine times out of ten every time you see me
Bending corners in my brand new Dodge Durango Hemi
Pimpin' the law up on us  Officer Smokey and Mr. Johnny Law
Always pullin' me over and searchin' my fucking car
Searchin' my Gluteus Maximus  flashlight in my jaw
Actin' like some batchesses  thinkin' I got rock
Doin' it big, take a swig, sip a sip, twist the lid, smoke a spliff, 
Earl bent, push ya wig, bout' my nig
Everybody wanna talk that talk, wanna walk that walk, wanna bark that bark
Everybody wanna plot that plot, wanna drop that saw, wanna peel up top
I get a call from young bop, he up out my zone
He said yo hillside nigga Ned on his way home
I said well tell him to call me  I love his ass to death
Any nigga hatin' we gonna take his last breath
Chrorus
Biatch ! It's yo partna from the town ma'an
I see yall doin' it big you getting' down ma'an
Yeah I fuck with the V, Richmond know me
Where every niggas ballin' that's where bitches gonna be
You can go across the bridge fucking wit a bitch
Don't matter which side you be all up in some shit before you know it
It aint like it used to be 
Everybody got straps to shoot you or me
I give a fuck about who, I don't even know you
Sup  yeah pimpin' I got my thang too
And its coo cause I know you know it
I aint even gotta pull it 
I aint even gotta show it
Don't blow it  that's what a black man's thinkin' 
I'll be laying underground in a casket stinkin'
If I slip I gotta keep my poise you here that 808 bumpin'  Whats all that noise
Repeat Chorus
Get ya head busted in  im not your boy or your friend
Get ya head busted in  im not your boy or your friend
You said that do that, pull that, shoot that
Now where your crew at
What you gonna do next
Im a west coast nigga yee
Im a east coast nigga yee
Im a down south nigga yee
Im a Midwest nigga yee
Repeat Chorus
