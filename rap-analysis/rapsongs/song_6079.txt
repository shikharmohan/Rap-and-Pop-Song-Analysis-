We doing this baby, oh shit
What the fuck happened?
Nah man, nah, nah this what I'm a do
I'm a get on the phone one time
Stupid, yo, aiyyo, aiyyo
Why this shit ain't cooking up right
Papi told me this is solid white
Fuck it wrap it up take it back up, still in all it's a play out
Tired of spending money, might get them niggaz laid out
Yo, yo Fernando sent me yo, stop acting hostile yo
And yo don't point that shit at me
Bad enough I gotta come in the crib
Wid Spanish niggaz using languages and shit
I'm feeling like a dick, left the crib with my hand brolic
This is some bullshit, might get knocked take the wrist coward
Yo Fernando what happened?
Shit cooking up backwards, light up a backwood
Don't make me backtrack, blew it dime it the llelo lay low
Saying in my mind, fuck that Papi gotta pay off
Cash rules the power woo chant it
Yo Louis this ain't our product, this is Carlos family
Oh y'all wanna play me like a smoker
Coming out my ice choker, my man in the back looking colder
Papi yo why y'all wanna jucks me
Yo listen B we got the best clientele since '83
Fuck it, pull out the pot let's cook it, light the stove up
Julie go to the store get some flour, sat back burning a big dutch
With the crisp eighteen shot glock, stashed in my nuts
Poured it in the Pyrex sizzling, now it start drizzling
Rainy day murder black won't miss him
Still I'm yelling this shit is business, but they still ain't gonna violate
What I stand for with these drizzers
He took it off the stove run the water
Trying to work me yo, knew I shouldn't a hit the nigga's daughter
He might  showed more love
Than went in the freeze, broke the ice down, pour it in
We both looking at it on the twirl around particles grew
Fly Khaluas is mad sliding coronas through
Feeling like Castro's cousin, gave them niggaz all of my life
All of my paper all my judgment, it droppa only like an ounce worth
Should I just come out my shirt, go berserk and let the macks burst
Skate off body in the Bronx, same shit, Gotti was on
Shallah they gonna get your's play it calm
Seventeen five was the total plus the five
Hundred for the cab driver that was rollin'
