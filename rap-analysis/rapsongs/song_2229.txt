Hustling till I die, drink the bar dry
There go that man again, right back in the public eye
Drunk like Mel Gibson, get high, got a ton of DUI's
Cognac sipping, XO, me and my guys
Born in colossal, living our lives
Trying to get this bobble head bobbin' so she can follow me to my ride
So I can make a dentist to convince her to open wide
Kick her out when I'm finished, take my baller ass back inside
Drug terminology, corner talk that's all I know
California mentality, ask about me pimp I go
You can check my track record, I don't like to feud
But if I must I'll have your head severed
Blacks live in traps, zones and projects
Corner boy greeting crack in the apartment complex
World wide outside of the Bay they give me my stacks
Do business with head execs and corporate execs
He ain't going nowhere, the boy too nice
He done it again and got rich twice
Keep a thump on top
We ain't broke, we papered up
He ain't going nowhere, the boy too nice
He done it again and got rich twice
Keep a thump on top
We ain't broke, we papered up
Cut him off like an umbilical cord, turn off his lights
We need to silence that brother, his voice too strong on the mike
I make it look easy but it's not, I'm just doing Feazy
Why should I stop now, pimp, The Game need me?
Be a real one, pimp, go get it and do what he used to
Trying to get this music scrapping, move it, push it and groove it
Louis luggage, rugging and rushing my intellect
Got suckas hollering and screaming my hood set
Designer socks on my Chevy box shaking the car
You need my alpha minute, too heavy I can't stop
Gaming plot, all my dudes on the grave clock
Hope I die and rock on my funeral on my block
The streets they don't play fair
The mayor, he really don't care
Momma worked 3 jobs, trying to keep a roof on hour heads
Bologna sandwiches, pulled the mold off the bread
He ain't going nowhere, the boy too nice
He done it again and got rich twice
Keep a thump on top
We ain't broke, we papered up
He ain't going nowhere, the boy too nice
He done it again and got rich twice
Keep a thump on top
We ain't broke, we papered up
Gotta a lil' thump, we got what you need
If you want it, got to copy it from me
We are sure you too could see that it's real
Everywhere we go we burn down the hills
Automatics and semi's, high performance and hemi's
In the thick of the soil, we think Buick's is Bentley's
Coffee pots boil, burn, fly, simmer and stew
I'm off of this oil y'all, I hope you is too
Out of the Beverly camp you need a crew
Showing our underwear, exactly that's what we do
Turf dropping and stacking and money making
Surfing, earthquake slapping and trunk rattling
He ain't going nowhere, the boy too nice
He done it again and got rich twice
Keep a thump on top
We ain't broke, we papered up
He ain't going nowhere, the boy too nice
He done it again and got rich twice
Keep a thump on top
We ain't broke, we papered up
Gotta a lil' thump, we got what you need
If you want it, got to cop it from me
We are sure you too can see that it's real
Everywhere we go we burn down the hills
Got rich twice, damn, got rich twice, damn
Got rich twice, damn, got rich twice, damn
Nigga, I'd done it again, damn
Nigga, I'd done it again, damn
Nigga, I'd done it again, damn
Nigga, I'd done it again, damn
