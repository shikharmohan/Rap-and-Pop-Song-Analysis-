It was 8:49 on a beautiful 9th day of July
There was not a cloud to speak of
So the orange sun hung lonely in the sky
I lay prone in my catboat home
Thinking of fine nappy Jackie and his jazz cat's horn
Sliding in a tape of bird on verve when suddenly rang my phone
"Hey butterfly", the voice said
Slip on some duds comb out your fro and slide on down to my pad
The vibe here is very pleasant and I truly request your presence
A problem of great magnitude has arose and as we speak it grows
Damn, what could it be I thought
A juice I bought and rolled on down to her [Incomprehensible]
Seeing bros I know slapping fives I arrived and pressed G-5
And there was Nikki lookin' some kind of sad
With tears fallin' from her eyes she sat me down
And dug my frown and began to run it down
"You remember my boyfriend Sid that fly kid who I love
Well our love was often a verb and spontaneity has brought a third
But do to our youth an economic state, we wish to terminate
About this we don't feel great, but baby that's how it is
But the feds have dissed me, they ignore and dismiss me
The pro-lifers harass me outside the clinic
And call me a murderer, now that's hate
So needless to say we're in a mental state of debate"
"Hey beautiful bird", I said digging her somber mood
The fascists are some heavy dudes
They don't really give a damn about life
They just don't want a woman to control her body
Or have the right to choose but baby that ain't nothin'
They just want a male finger on the button
Because if you say, "War", they will send them to die by the score
Aborting mission should be your volition
But if Souter and Thomas have their way
You'll be standing in line unable to get welfare
While they're out hunting and fishing
It has always been around, it will always have the niche
But they'll make it a privilege not a right accessible only to the rich
Hey pro-lifers should dig themselves 'cause life doesn't stop after birth
And for child borne to the unprepared it might even just get worse
The situation surely change if they will find themselves in it
Supporters of the h-bomb and fire bombing clinic
What type of shit is that? Orwellian in fact
If Roe V Wade was overturned would not the desire remain intact
Leaving young girls to risk their healths
Doctors to botch and watch as they kill themselves
Now I don't want to sound macabre
But hey, isn't it my job to lay it on the masses
And get them off their asses to fight against these fascists
So whatever you decide make that move with pride
Sid will be there and so will I
An insect 'til I die
Rhythms and sounds, spinning around
Confrontations across the nation
Your block, my block, dreadlocks what a shock
Land of the free but not me
Not me, not me, not me, not me
Not me, not me, not me, not me
