Yea, we gon' serve til I die, ok
New Playaz Circle
As a matter of fact it's gonna kill me
Bitch! Cuz u ain't!
Haaaaa!
(Tell 'em shortie)
So git high!
(Tell 'em Weezy!)
Or get low! Yea!
If I don't do nuthin' I'mma ball
I'm countin' all day like the clock on the wall
Now go and get your money little duffle bag boy
Said go and get your money little duffle bag boy, get money
And I ain't never ran from a nigga and I
Damn sho ain't bout to pick today to start runnin'
Look honey I ain't never ran from a nigga and I
Damn sho ain't bout to pick today to start runnin', get money
The beat so hot the flow is so ice cold
Walkin' to the Gucci store, honey I ain't home
I am on my shit, I need a Pamper on
Toilet paper on the side
For example homie, I get money
I know you niggas ain't heard no shit like this and
While you wishin' on that fallin' star I'm in a foreign car
Smokin' out with the doors ajar
Suede sun roof hangin' out the big top
We leave the dealership head to the rim shop
You niggaz barely dressin', I got thousands pilin'
That's that salad dressin' I'm on my thousand island
Whylin' stylin' I be I get so much money it's my I.D.
Don't try me, and if I don't do nuthin' I'ma fuckin' ball
And I ain't bout to start runnin' naw nigga naw
If I don't do nuthin' I'mma ball
I'm countin' all day like the clock on the wall
Now go and get your money little duffle bag boy
Said go and get your money little duffle bag boy, get money
And I ain't never ran from a nigga and I
Damn sho ain't bout to pick today to start runnin'
Look honey I said I ain't never ran from a nigga and I
Damn sho ain't bout to pick today to start runnin', get money
Ain't nuthin' to a boss we ballin' when you see us
We hear them hataz callin' they too far off to see us
Unless they got they glasses on get your bifocal game
Class is now in session now try to stay focus mayne
Your boy ain't good enough style ain't hood enough
Would've could've should've won't do with us true enough
Need a hoe break a hoe never nuthin' new to us
Turnin' hoes to house wives never been cool with us
Soon enough all these dealers is gonna catch up
Till then fuck it I'm winnin' so I'ma stack up
Flows like a river the current is so rapid
Hit with the ratchet that's how shit happens
Next time you're yappin' make sure it be about big money talk
Let that lil' money walk, call me what you want but don't call me for fronts
Southside I got what you want, come holla at me
If I don't do nuthin' I'mma ball
I'm countin' all day like the clock on the wall
Said go and get your money little duffle bag boy
Now go and get your money little duffle bag boy
And I ain't never ran from a nigga and I
Damn sho ain't bout to pick today to start runnin'
Look honey I said I ain't never ran from a nigga and I
Damn sho ain't bout to pick today to start runnin', get money
And if I don't do nuthin' I'mma ball
I'm countin' all day like the clock on the wall
Said go and get your money little duffle bag boy
Now go and get your money little duffle bag boy, get money
And I ain't never ran from a nigga and I
Damn sho ain't bout to pick today to start runnin', get money
I ain't never ran from a nigga and I
Damn sho ain't bout to pick today to start runnin', get money
