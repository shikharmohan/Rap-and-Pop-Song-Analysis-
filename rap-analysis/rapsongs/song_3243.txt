Yo check this out a lot of people be gettin' mad
'Cause I use the word 'nigga' you know what I'm sayin'?
They don't like the fact that I use the word 'nigga'
They say you a black man
Yo, I tell em I'm a nigga they don't understand that
So I'ma say what I wanna say
I call myself what I wanna call myself, you know what I'm sayin'?
So they need to stay off my dick, you know?
Damn right, I'm a nigga and I don't care what you are
'Cause I'm a capital N-I-double-G-E-R
Black people might get mad 'cause they don't see
That they're looked upon as a nigga just like me
I'm a nigga, not a colored man or a black
Or a negro or Afro-American, I'm all that
Yes, I was born in America, true
Does South Central look like America to you?
I'm a nigga, a straight up nigga from a hard school
Whatever you are I don't care, that is you fool
I'm loud and proud well endowed with the big beef
Out on the corner I hang out like a horse thief
So you can call me dumb or crazy
Ignorant, stupid, inferior or lazy
Silly or foolish but I'm badder and bigger
And most of all I'm a straight up nigga
That's right, I'm a nigga, you know what I'm sayin'?
My man Lord Finesse is my motherfuckin' nigga, you know?
Evil E's my nigga, Islam's my nigga
That's right they're my niggas
I'm a nigga in America and that much I flaunt
'Cause when I see what I like yo I take what I want
I'm not the only one that's why I'm not bitter
'Cause everybody is a nigga to a nigga
America was stole from he Indians, show and prove
What was that? A straight up nigga move
A low down shame, yo it's straight insane
Yet they complain when a nigga snatch their gold chains
What is nigga suppose to do?
Wait around for a handout from a nigga like you?
That's why a low down nigga gets hyped
But I'm not a nigga of that type
I'm a steak and lobster eatin', billionaire meetin'
Cash money makin', movin' shakin'
Corporate jet glidin', limousine ridin'
Writin' hits, filthy rich straight up nigga
That's right, I'm a nigga
Now I'ma write this song though the radio won't play it
But I got freedom of speech so I'ma say it
She wanna be lez he wanna be gay
But that's your business I'm straight so nigga have it your way
Those who hate me I got somethin' for ya
A nigga with cash a nigga with a lawyer
Not a watermelon cheatin' an' eating nigga down south
But a nigga that'll smack the taste from your mouth
A contemplating thinking, best champagne drinkin'
Ten inch givin', extra large livin'
Mercedes Benz drivin', strivin' to survivin'
All the way livin' and kickin' hi fivin'
Strokin' rap and happenin' deal doing
Fly in from Cali to chill with the crewin'
Grindin' groovin' fly girlie grabbin'
Horny gun shootin' long haired havin'
Nigga, straight up nigga
Nigga, straight up nigga
Nigga, that's right fool look at me
Just the kinda nigga you'd like to hang from a tree
But all you KKK type grave diggers
Ease back fool 'cause I'm a trigger nigga
I work real hard for my livin'
But I don't sell or brake bullshit thanksgivin'
Sit up like some fool and eat turkey
That's the day your forefathers jerked me
Shipped us all over here in locks and chains
Split us up twistin' up a nigga's brain
Now you keep me in constant sweat
But I'm a nigga that you'll never forget
A black bad, iron clad, always mad
Fly nigga takin' off from a helipad
Rolex stylin', buck wilin', cap pilin'
Sportin' link chinks and medallions
Incollectible high tech, cashin' seven digit checks
And still breakin' necks
The ultimate male supreme, white woman's dream
Big dick straight up nigga
