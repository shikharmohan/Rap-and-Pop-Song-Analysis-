How the hell did he manage to get more felony charges
He`s already got life in jail, man, what the hell is his problem
Well, to be honest the smell of these chronic leaves make me hella demonic
They`ve compelled me to kill this elderly man
And i get these panic attacks
Pop a xanax, relax
Tryna stick my ****in` dick inside a mannequin`s ass
Then i get manic depressed
See the orthodontist get gassed
Man, it`s kickass
The first thing i put on is the mask
Speaking of masks, man, it ain`t too late to have a change of face
And take it off and show my face so you can see the things you facin`
Slice you up and cook you after you`re murdered by strangulation
That`s bacon souffle you makin`, ain`t you? well, thank you jason
There goes one more coma
Due to blunt force trauma
Just give me one more soma
And i`ll be done for, mama
Go in the damn broom closet
Another valium, lost it
Shovin` the vacuum nozzle
Down the bathroom faucet
Seems like every day i get a little flakier
The medication is making my hands a little shakier
Hand me the 18 month old baby, come shake `em up
It`ll only take me a second to choke his trachea
Breakin` his neck in eightysome places
Baby, he`s shady comes lady
He`s got the razor-b-blades and the ch-ch-chain-ch-saw, baby
You b-b-blundering, bumbling m-m-mumbling dum-dum
Yeah, here i come-come, you hear the rumbling? vrum-vrum
There`s something inside of that blue tub and that drum-drum
My head and torso are some won` where they come from
Who`s it belong to, maybe the girl with the long blonde hair
Who disappeared and left her cheerleader pom-poms
Clearly there`s some` wrong
`cause she didn`t come home
She`s missing
Where is she
Something fishy is goin` on
I guess he stuck the xxxxx with the pitchfork with the long prongs
Now everybody get your dance on to my damn song
Come o
