Inside the minds of real g's
Death row is looked upon as the studio gansters of the 90's
A joke hahahaha in a gamecalled 5 minutes of fame you wasted
4 mimutes now you got seconds left kick it
Come one come all and let me ride nigga
Eazy-e cpt how the hell you figure
To be the best on the west hu ya
Fool loked down this is east side nigga
South comton and I put it on the map
So when a dog pound crip you wanna scrap
And that comin straight from the ruthless ganster eazy-e
Now what would I do haha lets see
Now I would take on sugas locked down the row
Since Dre is a bitch pimp slap the hoe 
Now I'm seeing doubles man two dogs in a huddle
Aa god dame now diggidi daze I biggidi blast 
On right one and smoke that azz 
Now kurupt dont even set trip
Yellin long beach 60 blood and puppy pound
Crip really doe got my nuts on your chin
Whill I'm all in your philly hoe
So come with it fool and test your luck and
I'll beat that azz now call me kurupt 
Now I'm kreepin threw the fog ya
Big dogg blue got my nine milla killa
Hunting a dogg named snoop 
You can run nigga but you can't hide
Eazy-e straight creepin on the east side 7
Tenlong beach south caught snoop free basin
In a rock house I kicks in da door
I said it befoe I never let no busta test me no more
Bang murder was the case that tey gave me 
Murder waz the case that they gave me

Murder was the case that they gave me watch out buddie boy

(so dont even think about steppin in the god damn house)
What would you do what would you do if we rolled on you 
What would you do what would you do if we rolled on you
What would you do what would you do dirty red 
I comes on the snake hittin niggas low
With the cavey ass flow as I kreep through the street 
Peeping niggas from death row bet you wanna know 
Which one make the best hoe so
Let me break it down as I'm lost in the mist
And take word of advice and dont come fucking with this
Aint a joke niggas choke frome the smoke that I blaze
Purple haze you be dazed in a stun
I'll put you on your back nigga what?
I am the guess in a doggy dogg world 
Never run with muss only nuts in their click
And dick in your mouth
The year is 95 and I'm runnin the house
Now tell what can you do nigga what can you do
If me and a few of my homies came through
Dummpin real on you trickmade bitchmade niggas
What could you do what could you do if we rolled on you
Yaa so dont even think about stepin in the god damn house
