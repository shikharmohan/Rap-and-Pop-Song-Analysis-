(Verse 1)	
I just wanna say my fault my bad
you couldn't do young too bad so sad
re-up too big might need 2 bags
soon as i drop this might go pop tags
might do big mall might do car lot
might call ??? might do wristwatch
might just chill in might just club hop
might invest mine all blocks no stocks
young'n run this shit you know that
really who bought them bricks they know that
hood trap money my shits throwback
i said what rap money might just blow that
                  (Hook)
i said i might just blow that i might just blow that (repeat)
                  (Verse 2)
Young'n run this shit no trapping
your money paid for it might of came with a back seat
