Game time, let's go, we in here
It's time to bring the East Coast back, baby
New York, The Dog, we in here
We talkin' 'bout the Swizz and the dog
Wasn't gonna terrorize y'all n***?
You can't be serious, Ruff Ryders
We gon' get it, get it started, get it started again
We gon' get it, get it started, get it started again
We gon' get it, get it poppin', get it poppin' again
We gon' get it, get it poppin', get it poppin' again
Follow me now, we in here
Six number one albums, imagine that
Cats' is sick 'cause dog got his swagger back
If that s*** go, naw, I ain't havin' that
But they don't want it, I'ma still grab the bat
Think I give a what? I'ma 'Get down, go hard' type of what
'Bring it to the yard' type what
Four, four, one, zero, five, fourteen thousand
Ten, ten haze the street with the housin'
C-76, remember me, grrr?
I'm that *** that for life, gon' be yo' enemy
F*** around, got my weight up, weight up, brought up
N*** gettin' ate up, straight up, what the f***?
Come on, vato, this is just not your day
So stop tryin' to be macho, aight, yo?
You don't wanna fight, yo, I get's my strap on
Put n*** lights out, clap on
We gon' get it, get it started, get it started again
We gon' get it, get it started, get it started again
We gon' get it, get it poppin', get it poppin' again
We gon' get it, get it poppin', get it poppin' again
Follow me now, we in here
We don't bark no more, we bite
What? From the heart, we can get this war on tonight
Ain't nuttin' but a thang 'cause the camp gets busy
*** wit the 'Line? It's a rizzy
S*** ain't the same, cats done changed the game

Twenty million records sold
While y'all what is strugglin' to go gold
Come on, papi, can't none of y'all what stop me
Yahmean? Y'all what is sloppy
What would the game be without me? Nada
Cats talk about a whole lotta
Prada, Gucci, ESCADA, Louis Vuitton, come on
What up with what's really goin' on?
What's hood? Cats ain't killin' nuttin' but a few minutes
I'm about to bury a box wit'chu in it
So if you got's the whip, you better get on
'Cause if I pull up on, it won't be for Grey Poupon
We gon' get it, get it started, get it started again
We gon' get it, get it started, get it started again
We gon' get it, get it poppin', get it poppin' again
We gon' get it, get it poppin', get it poppin' again
Follow me now, we in here
Cats playin' games, so I'm goin' raw
Run up in that f*** buildin', kick down the door
Y'all don't want no f*** problems wit X
Y'all don't wanna see them four-legged piece
Wit them collars on they necks
Wit them *** downstairs wit the tech, you know the rest
*** it, blow it, y'all n***, grrr, I take respect
Dog's *** hot, that's why y'all cowards froze me quick
I pop up, catch what on some cozy s***, what
With Chinese slippers and silk scarves on
N*** out here tryin' to get his bark on
Wonder why the dog gone
I couldn't take it, deface it, that n*** make s***
That's somethin' that'll happen, *** wanna brace it
And for the record, what you gonna do to fill up my spot?
I ain't gon' front, that 'Pon De Replay' s*** was kinda hot
Not, how you gonna jack Will Smith for a beat?
That's like tryna jack me for the streets, it ain't happenin'
We gon' get it, get it started, get it started again
We gon' get it, get it started, get it started again
We gon' get it, get it poppin', get it poppin' again
We gon' get it, get it poppin', get it poppin' again
