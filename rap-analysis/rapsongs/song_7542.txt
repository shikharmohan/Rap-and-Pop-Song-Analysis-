Shootin' dice in my hood must of lost 8 stack
Ain't nuttin' to a G hop back in my may back
But I'm only riding this 'cause the Chevy's in the shop

Catch me in the e a mill lookin' fo' dem bucks

They goin' for da 5, you can get 'em for da 4
We keep it round here just let a *** know
I'm on the block all day with them blocks all day
Straight splurge up in linen, I shop all day
Shut down champs did the food in product
Ya it's just a white tee but the shoes is product
I gotta bag full of stones 'n a pocket full of pills
Call me da x-men keep a pocket full of pills
Imagine this so much ice 'n a watch, how much?
You would of thought time froze
Welcome to my life ya the first episode
Never miss a beat, I gotta mini time code
Still count a quarter mill wit my f*****' eyes closed
In one hand behind my back get a f*****' blind fold
I said dat D boy bulls*** yeah, I'm still on it
I gotta half a brick left do anybody want it
They goin' for da 10, you can get 'em for da 8
Just holla atcha boy when you tryna get straight
I said dat D boy bulls*** yeah, I'm still on it
Think I gotta needle left, do anybody want it
They goin' for da 5, you can get 'em for da 4
We keep it round here just let a *** know

The boy get new money like the first day of school
Stay fresh like the first day of class
Two bricks 'n three choppas sold in one stash

Dem blunts burn slow but that paper come fast

Just holla atcha boy when you tryna get straight
I said dat D boy bulls*** yeah, I'm still on it
Think I gotta needle left, do anybody want it
They goin' for da 5, you can get 'em for da 4
We keep it round here just let a *** know
