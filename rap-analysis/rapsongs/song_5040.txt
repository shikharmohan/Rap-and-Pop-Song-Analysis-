Let me put you on game
Let me put you on game
Don't you know that I run this place?
And I've begun this race must I rerun this pace?
I'm the reason it's become this way
And their love for it is the reason I have become this praised
(Let me put you on game)
Love my darkness, I've made them heartless
And in return, the have become my martyrs
I've been in the poem of many a poet
And I reside in the art of many a artist
(Let me put you on game)
Some of your smartest have tried to articulate
My whole part in this but they're fruitless in their harvest
The dro rose from my footsteps, I'm the one that they follow
I am the one that they march with
(Let me put you on game)
Through the back alleys and the black markets
The Oval Offices, the crack houses and apartments
Through the mazes of the queens, the pages of the sages
And the Chambers of The Kings
(Let me put you on game)
Through the veins-es of the fiends, a paper chaser's pager
Yo, I'm famous on the scene
One of the oldest, most ancient-est of things
Speak every single language on the planet, y'all mean?
(Let me put you on game)
I am the American dream, the rape of Africa
The undying machine, the overpriced medicine
The murderous regime, the tough guy's front
And the one behind the scenes
(Let me put you on game)
I am the blood of this city, it's gas, water and electricity
I'm it's gym and it's math and it's history
The gunshots in the class
And you can't pass if you missing G
(Let me put you on game)
I taught them better than that, I taught them aim for the head
And hope they never come back
I'm glad your daddy's gone, baby, hope he never comes back
I hope he's with your mother, with my hustlers high in my trap
(Let me put you on game)
I hope you die in his trash
I can't help it all I hear when you're crying is laughs
I'm sure somebody'll find you tied in this bag
Behind the hospital little baby, crack addicts had
(Let me put you on game)
Then maybe you can grow up to be a stripper
A welfare-receiving prostitute and gold digger
You can watch on TV, how they should properly depict you
The rivers should flow with liquor, quench your thirst on my elixirs
(Let me put you on game)
I am the safe haven for the rebel runaway and the resistor
The trusted misleader, the number one defender
And from a throne of their bones I rule
These fools are my fuel so I make them cool
(Let me put you on game)
Baptize them in the water out of Scarface pool
And feed 'em from the table that held the Corleone's food
If you die, tell them that you played my game
I hope your bullet holes become mouths that say my name
'Cause I'm the
