Yeah she'll take you out too kid
A rainy day laid up thinkin' sitting gettin' bent
Watchin' old seventy flicks minds on the slouch
Back on the couch heard the phone ring
It was a shorty from uptown I met back day
Long time no hear from no doubt long time no see
I heard you had a seed a baby girl and now she 3
Whats up wit that cat, you know who your baby pops
Slung rocks up top then heard he got knocked
He home, fuck dat nigga I'm on my own
Matter fact got my own crib plus I'm all alone
Word? The bitch is bad, chill son she got me tempted
Reminiscing the fatty Jumped in the ride I rented rest Tims
Mecca dice well presented sippin' E and J straight
Was bent when I entered gave her a hug
Steered her straight into her mug
She ain't shes a bitch back then and now it's bugged
Turned the VCR on Friday, my favorite flick
Offer me a drink Alaze I take a sip
Got into convo, How you been over the years?
Neglected, stressed out, and living in fear
Whatchu mean? I thought you left that cat which was true
I'm not talkin' about him another dude
Been wit him for a year and had a baby by him, word?
Matter fact you saw him, downstairs you walked by him
Now I'm thinkin setup could it be or maybe not
She said don't sweat it he don't got the top lock
Tried to play it cool. But in my head shorties wildin'
Using me to get the next nigga jealous called up the fellas
Ty Nitty line was busy so I beeped Gotti, Gotti was
With Trip and two other grimes, The Twinz
Let me begin then explain
I'm at this bitch crib and I think she got me framed
Stuck without a gat, not prepared for combat
Gave the address, told my son there's more cats
Be here in a second, big gats no half steppin'
They flippin' on me talkin' 'bout I never learn my lesson
I laugh in additional hit 'em with the math
Hung up the jack, while shorty soaked in the bath
Played the living room, dozed off for a second
When I woke up shorty was standing ass naked
Make moves all this bullshit pussy betta be good
Step to da room, threw off my champion hood
Slow motion, all arm bent off the potion
Shorty went down and had a nigga wide open
It was over Laid up in the cut, I heard a thump
Jumped up threw on my boxers, yo, What the fuck?
All of a sudden, I saw this black motherfucker
With this big ass gat and two other motherfuckers
Black masks, clutching duct tape no escape
Tied me up, smacked me all in my face
Shorty wasn't even screamin', looked up saw 'em schemin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah we got this nigga yeah yo we got this
All bloodied up, shook the fuck up
Held for ransom they yelled got da bonus smiled and started dancin'
The phone rung it was my sons, let them know they had me hostage
Don't worry yo we got this regardless of the outcome
All this bullshit take a nigga word don't never go see a bitch, word
