[Verse 3]
A real nigga on top yall should be glad to see let me ask yall a question
and don't you laugh at me, come things first but I don't knoe why,
take them out the cage and they still wont fly,
take them out the flap and they still wont sell,
take them out ten times and they still gon' smell,
you can get a good lawyer but he still gone tell,
and you can fix a car and it's still gone fail,
I done did some buisness with mariah, lupee, usher,
same ol j.young aint no buster, never said I was a usher,
so how you gone sit an tell me I ain't no hustler,
I got bitches all round me young like usher,
don't leave your bitch around me young might fuck her,
catch me in the club baby, me and my shooters,
in a white drop top, hooters, broad day big bag, getting money, 5 grand we had...
rent money, real nigga till I die, get money, 20 in advance tip money.
[Chorus 2x]
