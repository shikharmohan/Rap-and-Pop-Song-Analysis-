Listen, Listen
Huh listen
Government got it where you can't do shit no mo'
The water ain't no good, the grass don't grow
Never mention schools ain't safe no mo'
Killing in the first grade, six years old
Ask yo self this
In what kind of world is that to raise yo children
Then again it really don't matter, where you gone go
You still gotta live it
Let's face reality, stop talking 'bout peace
That's a thing of the past
But then again that's a bald face lie
'Cause a few years ago you was hanging my ass
Be no presidents
Sometimes the whole world just pressed up against me
Think about it, young black man, come up set up for penitentiary
Do the math, all on you
Choose yo path, be a leader, pray for strength
Know when to cap and when to blast
Get back on track, we damn near got past crack
Then every dope dealer got snatched back
We all wit the black on black that's sad
Is it really in our nature what make it so bad?
But I ain't no better then the rest of y'all
Plus I came up in a house without no dad
I knew that you left, couldn't be there
[Incomprehensible], you didn't won't to
But that how it is, Lord help us
You know what we going through
It's bigger than us, it's out of my hands
That's why I'm praying to God
Oh Heavenly Father, keep my head above the water
It's Your world, but we Your children Your son's and Your daughters
We struggling trying to get it together
But some of us ain't gonna see tomorrow
Some of us ain't gonna see tomorrow
I know some of us ain't gonna see tomorrow
Somebody tell me what you get in a relationship [icnomp]
We ain't married so we can't get divorced
So the only thing left is domesticated violence
When a man uses a woman to take out his problems
He abuses that woman, then man must recognize his assignment
We got two kids and you pregnant again so how can we profit
That's bullshit
That ain't no reason to pull her arm out the socket
Baby I'm so sorry
You know that I love you and didn't wanna hurt you
When I put my hands on ya, I was wrong so I don't deserve ya
I never thought I'd see the day when they scrap a nigga
When they talk about 'em on the T V
Now my sister flipping in the grave
'Cause that's a cheap shot and I know this can't be me
Lord help her forgive me, God give me my purpose
Jesus break these chains, you know this is a vicious circle
But I got my trust in you
I know there will be light at the end of the tunnel
Had it been in many situations
She was there each and everyone of 'em
Keep me humble, I wanna take time out write down
And thank ya, thank ya
Trying to make it wit out you is something we can't do
It's bigger than us, it's out of my hands
That's why I'm praying to God
Oh Heavenly Father, keep my head above the water
It's Your world, but we Your children Your son's and Your daughters
We struggling trying to get it together
But some of us ain't gonna see tomorrow
Some of us ain't gonna see tomorrow
I know some of us ain't gonna see tomorrow
Lord tell them you difference
Between having eternal life or forever burn, burn
Lord tell 'em You was wit' me when I had my accident
And my truck started flipping and turnin'
When it feel like I was dying from the moment of impact
We rolled ten times
I was down on my best, that fool came on my side of the line
But when the truck did finally stop moving I was just fine
My little brother that was on the passenger side
Must of got hurt 'cause he was unconscious
We then had our tragedies
We was just talking so this can't be happenin'
But before I could say anything else
I saw the helicopter and the ambulance
My little brother came back through
First thing he said was "What is going on"
But the next thing he said was
"Watch over me Lord and keep me strong"
And right then and there, I knew every thing was gone be alright
But we ain't promised nothing
So thank you my Lord for saving his life
It's bigger than us, it's out of my hands
That's why I'm praying to God
Oh Heavenly Father, keep my head above the water
It's Your world, but we Your children Your son's and Your daughters
We struggling trying to get it together
But some of us ain't gonna see tomorrow
Some of us ain't gonna see tomorrow
Some of us ain't gonna see tomorrow
It's bigger than us, it's out of my hands
That's why I'm praying to God
Oh Heavenly Father, keep my head above the water
It's Your world, but we Your children Your son's and Your daughters
We struggling trying to get it together
But some of us ain't gonna see tomorrow
Lord some of us ain't gonna see tomorrow
Lord some of us ain't gonna see tomorrow
It's bigger than us, it's out of my hands
That's why I'm praying to God
