They say that it's easy to fall but it's harder to get back up
Stand tall through it all, player, don't give up
Like Richie Rich said back in the day was true
They can take you from the game but not the game from you
'Tired of Bein' Stepped On', crept on
Waitin' to get yo' fifteen minutes on the phone
I see you when you touch down
I see you when you come home, hold on
To all of my fellas up in jail that's in there gettin' swell
That ordered my music, bought my music through music-by-mail
We still out here doin' it, we ridin' Buick LeSabres
And puttin' dubs on them bitches, they callin' 'em scrapers
I'm tryin' to keep it as real as I can, man
You know I came in top ten on the SoundScan
I probably woulda came in bigger but them bootleggers
And that Internet shit be fuckin' off a nigga
To all my fellas that's down and doin' time right now
Hold on, stay strong
I see you when you touch down
I see you when you come home
To all my fellas that's down and doin' time right now
Hold on, stay strong
I see you when you touch down
I see you when you come home
I'm makin' spread, life's a factor
Tuna mayonnaise oysters needles and crackers
Liftin' water bags and doin' them calisthenics
No more beef and pork, just chicken turkey fish and lettuce
I heard you're hella swoll and you cut your hair
They tell me that you're benchin' almost 500 up in thayr
I see you when you touch down
I see you when you come home, stay strong
I ain't Cristal'd out, I still be drinkin' Cook's
Today I gave yo' momma some money to put it on yo' book
Oh and I forgot to tell you too
Congratulations on yo' newborn boy, he look just like you
The turf is still boomin', right now it's quiet and sober
You wouldn't believe the niggaz that's rollin' over
I know that you're happy for me I'm doin' my thang
Tomorrow I'ma shoot you some pictures 'cause they mean everything
To all my fellas that's down and doin' time right now
Hold on, stay strong
I see you when you touch down
I see you when you come home
To all my fellas that's down and doin' time right now
Hold on, stay strong
I see you when you touch down
I see you when you come home

Dedicated to all the incarcerated soldiers across America
E-Figgadel, man, got your back man like a masseuse trust that
Like a chiropractor in real life
Y'all stay strong, mayne, all my folks doin' life stay strong
All my folks that'll be out with the hurry up ness
Get out and get your life together baby it's naythun
We gon' make it happen, baby, trust that, 100
