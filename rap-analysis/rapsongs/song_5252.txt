What? What you want?
Represent, represent, represent
Yea, represent, check it out, check it out
Yo Mama don't wear no drawers
I saw her when she took them off
Standin' on the welfare line, eatin' swine
Tryin' to look fine, with her stank behind
You can ask the bitch and she'll tell ya fast
Methtical got style with his nasty ass
Are you ready, to face the consequences and suffer?
I even tell ya Momma you ain't shit, motherfucker
Bring it, and let that killer bee kid sting it
And represent, it's like heads up a brick, when I'm swing it
Get lost, I break you off something
I'm pumpin', like a Reebok, with a pump
From the jump and you was nothin'
Bet ya thought ya fuckin' clan
Had ya fuckin' back but they was frontin'
Smokin' dirt blunts and fuckin' nasty stunts and
Ya take the naked gun without the bullet, what ya bustin'
Get ya ship sunken, fuckin' with a drunken
Master disaster at enemy rap functions
Just an echo
Ripin' ripin' in the valley
Ripin' ripin' so to bring back
Sweet memories of you
And you can even ask your crew
Betcha bottom dollar that they tell ya fast
Methtical got style with his nasty ass
Who said the Wu Tang Clan? Was it you or your man?
You wanna point the finger, I'll bring ya
Thirty six chambers, be out, youze in danger
Let me pull ya brain outcha ass with a hanger
Didn't Momma tell ya not to talk to a stranger?
Now ya got ya neck, in the noose, of the strangler
Just recline, keep the meth in mind
I'll even test the knuckle check on the hands of time
What? And I'll be more than glad to bust that ass
All up and down the block, the street, the isle
Whatever, smokin' on a Spike Lee joint
Hey I'm mo' better, I'm hopin' niggaz get the point
'Cause they could never, stop the veteran, word to God
When I'm severin' the head of a mental vegetarian
The Method, at the weekend, with a whole lot of credit
The cuties I desire, I be the first to set it
Off, flame on like the human torch
Fantastic four for all the fans in the store
You can eat it all and it'll tell ya fast
Methtical got style for ya nasty ass
Ninety four baby, word up, recognize, recognize
Wu Tang, Killer Bee
The rza and the Method mza
Raider ruckus, where you at?
