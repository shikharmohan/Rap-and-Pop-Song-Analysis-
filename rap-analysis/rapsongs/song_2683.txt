Gav I just drank a Red Bull baby...
Hey I'm a vibe man.....
Oh yes, oh yes whoo!!!....
Oh my God.....
(You got it!)
Whoo! Ho, ho...
Bust that gat if you feel that bull
Spit, spit that flow if you feel that cold
Who that? If you feel that I beefs that real
Then bet ya deal I promise that my words gon kill
Pop that, crack that Moe if you feel her flow 
Blow that, blow that dro let ya eyes hang low
Who that? Who that be in the new black Z?
F, O, X nigga theres no better than me 
Fox 5 cocksucker now who better then we?
And with Rob Dolla locked still who fuckin wit he?
I brings forth the Fev, the negativite, the crisis 
Ya'll niggas understand why I write this 
I should be talking to Ophra like the ghetto Jehovah
I'm door to door with my flow I talk how I live it 
What you see is how I get it, I'm ill, I'm sick wit it 
Fuck ya'll think I'm a gimmick? (Eh!)
I'm the best that ever did it 
More love to Shante' my friend 
Who was "Fox" back then 
Ya'll don't underdstand 
I had J and she had Sham 
and I rocks chinchilla how she rocked Dapper Dan and 
Everything I say is a open book 
When I spit these bars I don't need no hook 
You see everything I say is a open book 
And when I spit these bars I don't need no hook 
(Eh!)
Hold that,
Hold ya dough, I'm a show you flow 
Slow that, 
Slow ya roll I'ma coach you slow
Know that critical flow come from the mind of the sick 
And since they say that I'm seven 
It's only right that I fit
Seven years
Through the blood
Sweat and tears 
Almost caught a brain tumor 
Tried to escape all these rumors
When insane for a second
When I crashed my Range
But that's the price of this fame 
I must live wit this pain but
Why don't you mention my name? 
Fox is not a mime I don't read between lines and
When I write it's a open book 
When I spit these bars I don't need no hook 
You see everything I write is a open book 
And when I spit these bars I don't need no hook but
Everything I write is a open book and when I spit these bars I don't need no hook nucca
Jhea, I need another Red Bull man
I mean these things get me so focus man
Yeah, I mean bitches just don't spit like this man
I should be compared to niggas
I'm one of the five elite
Ain't no classifying me man.....
