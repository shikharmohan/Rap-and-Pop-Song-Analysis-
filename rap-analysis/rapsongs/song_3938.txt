Intro: Puffy
To be, or not to be
Chorus: Lil' Kim
It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit
It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit
It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit
It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit
It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit

It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit
It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit
Verse One: Puffy
Ain't another crew like us,
That could do like us
See the world from a view like us,
Still always come through like us
They ain't true like us,
If they only knew like us
There's less than a small few like us,
And they ain't pay dues like us,
Never on P's and Q's like us,
They don't move like us,
They don't have the right to choose like us,
Or get mad cause they ain't blew like us
They ain't on que like us,
They don't fit the shoe like us,
Don't know who's who like us, (who dat?)
Strangers,
Ain't aware of the danger
They heads up wit thoroughbred cats
That knock em back to get they ac's???
They a hard case to crack,
I'm a hard face to track
Fast as they can test us,
We flip em on they backs, like that
The many men that make or break must stay together
Cause together, its hard to break us
Chorus: Lil Kim
It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit
It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit
It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit
It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit
It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit
It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit
It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit
It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit
Verse Two: Mark Curry
I'm a have to warn em,
You don't wanna double cross us
Haven't you heard,
How many got they loss with us
You don't wanna force with us,
Cause shit cause with us,
Ain't nobody boss with us
We got fours to dust
It's no being better off than us
And ain't a hotter source than us,
And these streets ain't divorcing us
We ain't got no remorse in us,
Know to hold your horse with us
No cuttin shorts with us,
Here to stay, no abortin us
No extortin us
Between us,
We got the mic to maime with artillery
The four is all free range
Who's domain
When shots ring, who remains
They refrain,
Who walks away with the gain
Us
Thorough niggas thats hard to top
Together, were too hard to stop
Chorus: Lil' Kim
It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit
It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit
It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit
It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit
It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit
It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit
It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit
It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit
Verse Three: Lil' Kim
Ain't a bitch like me,
That can spit like me,
Who could say they rich like me,
They don't hold a four fifth like me,
Ain't a hit like me,
Nobody load the clip like me,
Cut coke and flip like me
Make hit after hit like me
Wear the title Queen Bitch like me,
Ya'll ain't good and fed like me,
And ya'll don't give head like me,
Plus your crew don't break bread like me,
Think about it
This a one shot deal
Ya'll got one shot still
When my gunshot peel
Thats a one shot kill
I'm so far ahead,
Ya'll can't touch my last spread
Cause most of ya'll is misled and underfed
Hey, what can I say
I'm a ???????
Now all aboard if you ridin my train
Choo chooo
I can represent they gang,
Whether you from the east side (east side)
Or the west side,
worldwide
Chorus: Lil' Kim
It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit
It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit
It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit
It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit (its that gangsta shit)
It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit
It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit
It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit
It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit
