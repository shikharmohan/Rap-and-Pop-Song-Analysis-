(Oh)
  (Aa hey hey)
{This one is dedicated to you}
(Ohh, umm)
(Aeye)
Foxy Brown, Wayne Wonder
Puttin it down
Whoa, oh, c'mon
But the saddest day of my life
Was when she left me with a broken heart
I was feeling the pain
(The pain, the pain)
The saddest day of my life
Was when she left me with a broken heart
I was going insane
(Yeah, yeah)
Now I'm the type of bitch that's one of a kind
  (Ohh)
Y'all know, the kind of bitch that like to sip that fine wine
  (Umm)
Like to be on top or get it from behind
Either way I throw the pussy like the free toll line
  (Aeyeah)
Break a nigga spine, tote a Calico and dare
Any bitch if come try test mine
  (Umm)
Violate, one time, I cock the nine
You, motherfuckin right I bust a bitch over mine
Shit, niggaz can cheat and put tips in bitches' waist
But when we slip up, get a gun in our face
  (Oh now, oh now)
Have me missin' show dates, heart beatin' slow pace
Wonder what he doin, who the fuck he screwin'
Bitches ain't shit, know that that's your man
  (Ohh)
And they still fuck around and try to suck the nigga dick
  (Ohh)
And I'm a bad bitch, I don't play that bullshit
Bitch'll catch wreck, I ain't got a full deck nigga
(Shubadubadub yeah)
But the saddest day of my life
Was when she left me with a broken heart
I was feeling the pain
(The pain, the pain)
The saddest day of my life
Was when she left me with a broken heart
I was going insane
(Yeah, yeah)
Ever since I was a little girl always wanted to know
How the fuck these niggaz think, why a man move so
  (Shubadubadub yeah)
Why would you jeopardize your whole life
Fuckin' one bitch for one night, blame it on the liquor
  (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
How would you feel if I fucked another nigga
And told you  that motherfucker made me cum quicker?
  (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You'd probably grab the gat and put two in my back
One in my face, nigga but it's one in my waist
Go 'head and slip, watch me shut down this bitch
Cheat on who?
Nigga I'll be gone before you
  (Oh no no no no)
And when you with the one you love, disrespect the game
Before he drive you insane, losin' your fuckin' brain
Foxy Brown, Wayne Wonder
Puttin' it down
Whoa, oh, c'mon
But the saddest day of my life
Was when she left me with a broken heart
I was feeling the pain
(The pain, the pain)
The saddest day of my life
Was when she left me with a broken heart
I was going insane
(Yeah, yeah)
For months I used to cry, felt like I wanted to die
  (Oh yeah)
Kept asking God why do I deserve this?
  (Oh yeah)
We all make mistakes, ain't nobody perfect
  (Oh yeah)
We're human, and through it all, I remained a good woman to you
  (Oh yeah)
Prayin' for strength and losin' my faith
  (Oh yeah)
How could you lay in my bed and lie in my face?
  (Oh yeah)
Jumpin' out my sleep
Havin' nightmares of me tossin' and turnin', my heart still burnin'
  (Hey)
Watchin' me suffer, relivin' my fears
Holdin' my pillow close while you dryin' my tears
  (Oh no no no no)
Stop your blood clot cryin', need to stop lyin'
And look me in my eyes 'fore these plates start flyin'
And how the fuck could you disrespect us
  (Oh)
Everything we stand for, all our love and our trust
  (Oh no no no no)
Seems like I said before, you won't appreciate me
And everything we have 'til I'm out the fuckin' door
  (Shubadubadub yeah)
But the saddest day of my life
Was when she left me with a broken heart
I was feeling the pain
(The pain, the pain)
The saddest day of my life
Was when she left me with a broken heart
I was going insane
(Yeah, yeah)
Try to erase all the memories
They're the ones they goin' see
If I could forget all about the past
Oh no no no no, how long will this go on?
But the saddest day of my life
Was when she left me with a broken heart
  (Oh yeah)
I was feeling the pain
(The pain, the pain)
The saddest day of my life
Was when she left me with a broken heart
  (Oh yeah)
I was going insane
  (Oh yeah)
(Oh yeah)
(Oh yeah)
Oh no no no no
Ohh, come on
