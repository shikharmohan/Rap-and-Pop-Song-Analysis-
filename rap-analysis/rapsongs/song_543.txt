was just a big bag of seeds, these niggaz done got me for my money, I done 
spent a couple of hundred, motherfucka, naw........I guess I gotta chalk it as 
a loss, but Im mad cause Im puffin and Im puffin and ah......I still ain't 
cough.....this shit is not gettin me high man, I am not high, the shit too 
soft, I need some weed, he gotta kick, or punch, the shit that fucks you up, 
that one hit'll quit it cause you'll be too lifted after you're done takin hits 
off the blunt, that gobble was workin me like a downer, I need to be easy,

All I wanna do, smokin and chokin, but ain't nobody got no good, so I gotta 
move on, I gotta find that really good, good for my lung, yea, yea, yea, cause 
I'm in need for that sticky sticky green, ain't had my blunt yet, so a nigga 
got an attitude, excuse me if I'm rude, but that's just the way that the weed 
does your dude, throw your hands up if you're weeded, uh huh, throw your hands 
up if you need it, come on, I'm searchin and I'm searchin and I still ain't 
come up, why didn't I think of this before lil Dre, let me hit em on up, I hit 
em up, he said he'd come on thru, he got the L.A., the L.A., I said I'd be 
right thru, I finally got my blunt, I'm feelin so good, it's so hard to find 
that real goody good in my hood.....

I just got off the plane, coming from Cali I was...smokin so good, need to go 
get me a sack right now, let me roll to the hood, now I can't find tweed, and 
Ken out of town, now I'm thinkin of what I'ma do when I got to get high, not to 
fuck around when it come to the herb, I splurge, anything ain't gone cut it, I 
just got paid with a pocket full of money and today I ain't on no budget, 
searching high, low, out of my mind, I'm ready to blow, I'm feelin the stress, 
I'm getting depressed, weedman don't love me no more, and I'm driving thru the 
city, feelin empty inside, cause I can't get high, and this here ain't how I 
ride, had to stop and holla at my lil niggaz, petty hustlin and drug peddlin, 
twice convicted thug felon, just to see what he was sellin, it was the brown 
weed with stems, he swore it was the bomb, I was ready to flip but I stayed 
calm, copped the 20 and stayed charmed, my momma never said, momma never said 
that it'd be days like this, I'm breakin rules, but nigga ooh I gots to blaze 
this shit

today, and ooh, even though he sellin yey he, he pulled lil Bizzy to the side, 
he said lil Bizzy you know my lil sister she does braids, my hair must be

said hey Big Blood, you got some drugs.......
