Hey, whatever happened to the emcees
Times done changed for the emcees
Every woman and man wanna emcee
But for what, I tell you emceein' ain't for you
Hey, whatever happened to the emcees
Times done changed for the emcees
Every woman and man wanna emcee
But for what, I tell you emceein' ain't for you
Man, I'm on the set like the flicks, so let your cameras flash
A splash bigger than whales, I'm makin' monsters mash
Spit Pinocchio's Theory when shit be lookin' weary
I need rest but I boogie for now, I'm on some mess
Like the best mics respond to me
Livin' days like dreams of specializin' in the art that pays
I be a mystic for life, so check my ID number
Emcees be kneadin' dough while I make bread like Wonder
Yes, that's what you heard, so save that actin' for the screen
See you can can that manager with the beans
I bust emcees like lies, surprise 'em out the box
Put away the soda pops, I'd rather rub on the rocks
A dime-getter tried to get what I got, for what?
I guess Southern folks cash makes the lovin' come fast
But I'm past all of that, it's time to break with the breeze
Get to your knees, here comes the supa emcees
Hey, whatever happened to the emcees
Times done changed for the emcees
Every woman and man wanna emcee
But for what, I tell you emceein' ain't for you
Whatever happened to the emcees
Times done changed for the emcees
Every woman and man wanna emcee
But for what, I tell you emceein' ain't for you
Supa emcees, supa emcees, supa emcees, supa emcees
Supa emcees, supa emcees, supa emcees, supa emcees
Within this program of rap, I'll eradicate the glitches
Yo, I'm dark like Wesley but I be sparkin' more bitches
And to them my constellation put your lives in jep
While you others represent, I present my rep
'Cause when it comes to makin' dents, I'm that main in print
Even smoked from blunts which give eyes the reddish tint
Could not prevent, you from seein' I'm the light
But bring attention to my words like some ads in tights
I heard you want to fight me with your words on stage
So Mase pulls that instrumental from the jam you made
And as he starts cuttin' what you sold, I'll talk all over your tones
As if my name was Pete Rock or Sean Puffy Combs
Send your tattered ass home with celly phones, I roam
With my fleet, here to make this rap game complete
While you live fables, unstable, actin' very radical
Projectin' like you're hard, when in fact you're quite vaginal
Whatever happened to the emcees
Times done changed for the emcees
Every woman and man wanna emcee
But for what, I tell you emceein' ain't for you
Hey, whatever happened to the emcees
Times done changed for the emcees
Every woman and man wanna emcee
But for what, I tell you emceein' ain't for you
Supa emcees, supa emcees, supa emcees, supa emcees
Supa emcees, supa emcees, supa emcees, supa emcees
Supa, supa, supa, supa, supa, supa, supa, supa
Supa emcees, supa
