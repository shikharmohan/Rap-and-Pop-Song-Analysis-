Oh, we get started up one more time
I got the number down right here, I'm looking at it
I couldn't believe she would do me like that P
I just don't understand it, dog, can't understand it
Ladies and gentleman
Wanna welcome y'all back to 'The Minstrel Show'
Thank y'all for tuning in, y'all keep watching a lotta the station
But y'all touring us right now and it feels so beautiful
Performing at black face tonight, it's my nigga, Joe Scudda
He'll come on up a little bit later on in the show
I just wanna thank y'all for just tuning in
It's like this yo
Yo, when 'Te pulls his verses out, promoters pull their purses out
That, money for a purchase out
The charge card that they swipe for the worst amounts
'Cause this is business not personal
Thought I would switch my personnel
Like Big Doe and Big Pooh would be the first to bounce
But y'all, niggaz is boring me, y'all never gon' change
And please, join a sorority, go step your game up
Y'all boys ain't ready for damage, you need extra planning
You in the game, but you off-size and gotta extra man
And I'm the coach doing your reprimanding
I got a team to run, boy, respect my standards
And when I'm on the mic, y'all should expect the grandest
Showing lyricism, ever let 'em know who your man is
It's Phonte
Don't stop, can't stop, yes, I wanna

  (It's rapper Big Pooh)
I got a prob with, niggaz speaking gossip
Talk about what you know, nothing it is nonsense
That's a Bronson, Charlie take precaution
Get you sold on the block, no, not an auction
Dearly departin', I'm not a G
But I move like they move with a head full of smarts man
Here these niggaz go rambling
'Cuz they don't know about the business we be handling
But let 'em know
Constant hits keep 'em scrambling
Till the stores, till the shelves dismantlin' and
And what's that joint 9th sampling?
Pooh and 'Te on the mic, them bastards them, damn
And your women, we attractin' them
And if you ever wanna know what's happening
We tell 'em, oh
Don't stop, can't stop, yes, I wanna

Can't stop, won't stop, yes, I wanna

Don't stop, can't stop, yes, I wanna

Can't stop, won't stop
  (It's Joe Scudda)
I wake up every morning, holding my dick
Going through life, like I know I'm the shit, ya ain't fucking with me
So why try? Why go that route?
Why take that street? You can't take that heat?
Man, your whole flow weak, we will take that beat
Put our own words on it, we will make that street
To the crowds and the masses and all I ask is
Don't settle for the average, rap cabbage
Heads, yeah, you heard what I said, we the best here
'Cuz our worst days be better than your best years
We your worst fears, so get up, get out, and get somethin'
Man, it's only getting worse here
Joe Scudda, Little Brother, man, we family
And yo, we here forever, so, understand me, it's real
Don't stop, can't stop, yes, I wanna
  (Check the realness)
Can't stop, won't stop, yes, I wanna
  (If you can feel this)
Don't stop, can't stop, yes, I wanna
