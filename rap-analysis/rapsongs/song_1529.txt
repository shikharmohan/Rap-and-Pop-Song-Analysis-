High on sunshine, lighting my way
And yes y'all, you are about to build witness
From the lands of Long Island
Taking you to the sky's survival
I am your captain, ain't no lie
On this endless journey
To envisions, to broaden your outer visions
To where you never been before
It's just a one night trip to love
Sun shining forever and forever sun shines
Yo, leaving lasting impressions like cuts to flesh
Be that crew from the five one six point of view
With skills so tight, they the rhymes of a vagina
Them clits will turn into a diamond, the level of rhyming
Pressure comes from lessor forms than me and my man
And we go back like life created from um, specks of sand
And there's money to be made 'cause Caucasians are paid
Only brothers who rhyme, seek bounce and catch balls
Plug 1 with them rhymes making your heart stall
Like them girls when you in they room when they man calls
It ain't nothing but the thing wonder why can bring
As we come to the bring the pain everyone will sing
De La is the crew that you must hear
But please don't rush the stage
'Cause even though them stakes are really high
We're really not here to race
We're just here to move your mind and soul
With perpetuated ease
It's just about the show until it's time to go
And get with the young ladies because
I'm on traveling to places that the eye can't see
But kinder 'cause yo' strife don't mean a thing to me
Throwing me criminal looks, y'all need to get in the books
And drop some water in your melon, 'stead of acting like a felon
Aiyo son, who you telling? I'd make a mil if it was up to me
But since it ain't I teach my seed to bank hard
And thank God, I smoke a substance of a different kind
Catch me tripping on earth when I'm high off sunshine
Down right to dirt, wonder why it makes it work
With access to talent like Caucasians to yellow cabs
With an Arab driver
I liven parties with marvelous conviction
Ain't no friction when life claims them victims to be wrecked
Such dried up funds best believe that the life is trife
'Cause the gun made a man outta pussy's from around my way
Who usually wouldn't have a fucking thing to say
Last year's hard rocks are now petrified boulders
And L.I.'s finest is moving yo' necks at shows
The anthem of this guy has a place in yo' eye
So you can be blessed to see in 3d double-e
De La is the crew that you must hear
But please don't rush the stage
'Cause even though them stakes are really high
We're really not here to race
We're just here to move your mind and soul
With perpetuated ease
It's just about the show until it's time to go
And get with the young ladies because
