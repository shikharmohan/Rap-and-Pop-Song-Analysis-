Yo, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Stop the cameras, stop the press, stop the press
Now Bill, this yo' nigga, Snoop Dogg
Now answer me this, did you fuck that bitch or what?
That's actually not the first time that question's been asked
But since I believe and I think any person, reasonable person
Would believe that, that is not covered in the definition of sexual
Relations I was given, ahh, I'm not going to answer it except
To refer to my statement, I had intimate contact with her that was
Inappropriate, I do not believe any of the contacts I had with
Her violated the definition I was given therefore I believe
I did not do anything but testify truthfully on these matters
What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie sometimes?
What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie, hie

What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie, hie
Lies, lies, stories and alibis
Big Mac in the land of the small fries
Everyone lies and tries to get by
Some of us drink while most just get high
You tryin' to cover up the holes in your sneakers
You need to put your motherfuckin' face to the speakers, babom, babom
And quit tryin' to run from it, holla holla at me
And c'mere you big dummy, dumb ass nigga
Don't you know you can't run from the Dizzogg
I'm down with gizza, the long arm of the lizzaw
Y'll niggaz know what's happenin' you turn your back again
And I'm bound to get it crack-a-lin, I'm back again
And everybody happy for me, ain't that the truth?
That's a motherfuckin' lie, fuck that fool
Black folks stick together 'til we die, hmm
That'll be the day
What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie sometimes?
What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie? Hie
What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie sometimes?
What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie? Hie
Liar, liar, pants on fire
Smoke so much dope they call me Snoopy Pryor, well Goddamn
Which way is up? I'm tryin' to get higher
I won't stop puffin' 'til I retire
My bitches, my niggaz, they off the wire
They lovely, they love me, call me Sire
Movie star bitches the ones you desire
Angela Bassett, Tyra, Mariah, the flyest, the flyer
See most bitches like fuckin' with a rider
Slider, to the sider, invite her to a gangsta, party provider
With a lot of meat by-products
And beat the puddy-pot and got up
She licked the dick from the top
To the bottom that's a bad bitch
Then she grabbed me by my nuts
And said, "Hmm I got 'em"
What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie sometimes?
