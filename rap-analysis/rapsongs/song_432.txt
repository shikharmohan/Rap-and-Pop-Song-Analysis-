Ouija are you with me?  Mo murda, mo murda, mo murda me now.
Dear Mr. Ouija, I want to know my future, will I die of murda, of bloody murda?
Come come again,
Murda murda, mo murda, mo murda murda, mo murda, 
mo murda murda, mo murda, mo murda murda, mo murda.
[Simultaneously, repeated:]
Mo murda murda, mo murda, mo murda, mo murda,
mo murda murda, mo murda, mo murda murda, mo murda.
Ouija are you with me?  With me.
Ouija are you with me?
I'm here.
Will I die of murda?
