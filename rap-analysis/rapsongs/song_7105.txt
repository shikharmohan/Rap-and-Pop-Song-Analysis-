Trapped, no shield, no sword
The unbeaten path got my soul so sore
Allured by the lust, something money can't cure
The Devil want me as is, but God, He want more
Eyes closed, eyes open, great another day, here we go
Like a nigga woke up late in The Truman Show
Livin' life without a care, mean poker face
But I'm forced to play solitaire 'til I get up out of here
Move like a wanted man with a bounty on his head
Work alone, sleep alone, eat alone, daily bread
Countin' till my fingers' red, how you gon' judge a man
Walkin' in the shoes of a man with a broken leg?
Flame on the trail headed for the powder keg
Last place in the race I ain't never led
Like I ain't never bled, time to get up out of bed
Servin' in the army of one, it's on again
Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk all alone
I always been on my own ever since the day I was born
So I don't mind walkin' alone
Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk all alone
I always been on my own ever since the day I was born
So I don't mind walkin' alone
I'm in a chess match, I'm in a death trap
I'm tryin' to find out where the eggs in the nest at
I'm one blood when the sky turns jet black
No love in the world can correct that
I'm in a slow lane, I'm on my Cobain
I'm in the new spot tryin' to run a old game
I got a new chick, put out my old flame
No peace, no sleep, no love for a young beast
You can put me in a cage
You can put me in the jungle where the lion get blazed
There ain't no hell like the hell I raise
I'd die in the bed I made 'fore I lay with a love I loathe
I'm a snake in the garden of bones
I'm a loner in a world of clones
I'm the piece that don't belong, see I roam
Where the the Reaper roam 'til they put my name on a stone
Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk all alone
I always been on my own ever since the day I was born
So I don't mind walkin' alone
Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk all alone
I always been on my own ever since the day I was born
So I don't mind walkin' alone
The longest walk I'll probably ever be on
The Road to Perdition, guess I'm finna get my plea on
I pray these wings strong enough to carry me on
I promise every second felt as if it took an eon
Walkin' like the lost boys of Sierra Leone
The trail of tears what they got me like a Cherokee on
Between the ears somethin' I require therapy on
For the workin' to the bone like my name Robert Dion
I go above and beyond, the duty called, truly y'all
Even though they kind of blew me off like a booty call
Asked me if I'm just another muli or a movie star
Forced to face the music like a graduate of Juilliard
Walk alone, talk alone, get my Charlie Parker on
Make my mark alone, shed light upon the dark alone
Get my sparkle on, it's a mission I'm embarkin' on
A kamikaze in the danger zone far from home
Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk all alone
I always been on my own ever since the day I was born
So I don't mind walkin' alone
Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk all alone
I always been on my own ever since the day I was born
