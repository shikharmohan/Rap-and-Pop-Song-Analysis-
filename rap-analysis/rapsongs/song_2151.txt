Chorus: Suga T
He said he's just a, timah name, rang-in
Major factor, Fed Ex
High-powered lawyers, and a
young nigga havin his wayyyy!
Verse One: E-40
? and cry with his motherfucking nose in the corner
Broke up out of that old punk shit and said,
"Momma I'ma do what the fuck I wanna!"
Hit the streets and make a wheelbarrow full of bread if I end up dead
then press delete -- I'm tired of eating powdered meat
Within a nigga timah to get to the grind, so that boy scored a quarter key
Two hundred and fifty-two electronic milligrams
We'll sell it like a coke candy organization
and I'm plugged with it, bail off into that old high-powered shit
These are the type of niggaz that'll let a nigga know
when the drought about to hit, my ?peach and jelly?
Get a 40 and mask it, post it on God
Because me got me scratch paper buried in the backyard
Me and my Click roll thick for real and be thinkin of funk like you a moth
Problems nigga?  Let that go or get your head tooken off
Catch you out of bounds on the wrong fuckin s-oil
Wrap that ass up like aluminim f-oil
I'm Fed Ex, heavy duty nigga, pushin weight (pushin weight)
From sardines and Spam to Teriyaki steak; motherfucker ain't but
plus sixteen, fuckin around with the skillet, makin a killin
Runnin through three or four units a week on the over over
Puttin the Whammy on em (Whammy on em)
Cake up and baking soda, ALL THAT old shit
(What's yo' occupation?)  Motherfucker I'm a timah
Chorus: Suga T

Verse Two: E-40
Bitch I thought ya knew, bitch I thought ya knew -- huh, now check it
I'm to the point where I don't touch it no mo'
You probably got lieutenants and killers all on the squadron
with po-po's on payroll, huh
Lavish vehicles, they only make life fo'-up
Front row seats at the fights, takin long expensive flights, huh
Q's, P's, birth certificates and fake ID's
Like to drink liquor, with beadies and leaves
The motherfuckin fuzz wanna stop us
Found our fingerprints on some choppers
Listenin to the scanner, I hear the Penelope's say
"Man uhh, them nigger boys, I can't stand uhh"
Young hoodlums sellin hawk, cloggin up the block
Inna come-a new 6-double-zero drop
We party in matches V.I.P.'s nigga fuck a fly
Invite celebrities like E-40 and J.R. Ridah, timah
	"I'm so serious!"
	"I'm so serious brotha!"
	"I'm so serious brotha!"
	"I got n...."

	"On a mission about my mail, to the hillside of Vallejo" (7X)
Verse Three: E-40
You niggaz got me fucked, FUCKED UP
Me yanked myself up out the game, hold up, motherfucker
I got bills to pay, nigga if you don't get out my way
I'm gonna peels your toupee, I'm in it to stay and I'm strapped in the Bay
but I never woulda thought that I would feel like
that I can invest my money in a franchise
Get em up out the hood before my homies lose they lizzives
Buy a fuckin record company and watch my mail rise
Ha ha, yeah, timah
Big Timah, a motherfucker have his br-ead, may-an
Fed Ex to the highest degree, tax free
Ballin out of motherfuckin control
A major factor playin a white man's game man
Sneak in and sneak out
Campaign champagne and clam thang
Game can be sold and told at the same time
And this shit here is designed to sprinkle yo' mind
High-powered ass shit man for my high-powered ass Clickalation
Get it while it's good before it's to graduation
Understand me?
