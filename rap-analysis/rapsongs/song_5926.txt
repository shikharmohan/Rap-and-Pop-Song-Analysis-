From the basics and warm, weather places
Dedicated to the brothers that never made it
Cut short, they prime read life between the lines
Photographed by rhymes yo it's hard times
All across the nation cold points of frustration
Created hot joints of illustration
Concentrate while stakes are high falling victim to the lie
Keep a sharp eye there's a steady supply of hate in the air
To them cats who stare the ice grill with the glare
But everything is fair in the city the sheisty the shiftee
I'n the epitomee of a raw deal now carry a sword and shield
And walk with a forcefield for real I overcame the odds
And got the hell out of dodge soul survivor of the war
And master in charge
Everyday I see the same ol' things
But my true and real live nigga keep on risin
And it's a shame but business never changes
And my crew knows what to do they're soul surviving
And if I die...
I watched the whole world from the side of my eye
I seen a lot of cats die and evil men lie
On the road to riches in pursuit of my wishes
It's a close call between friends and snitches
On the low the game brought moments of pain
Strong emotions plus the hardships of fame
No need to live forever just keep some type of cheddar
A buttersoft leather to rock in cold weather
Times are mad real official like the seal
Try to understand what I feel
My word to the wise it's where ya heart lies
Keep your biz straight far from family ties
I'm the illest soldier that represents the culture
Dignified bywords like fresh, fly and ultra
Champion heroics and passionate poets
Flashback to the future let it self focus
Everyday I see the same ol' things
But beautiful black sisters keep risin
And it's a shame but business never changes
And my crew knows what to do they're soul surviving
And if I die...
Still in basement for four years arranging
Lyrics and beats my first lote engagement
It's outstanding the boy wonder's back in the world
By popular demanding on top commanding
My own destiny go ahead try to test me
I been living right so expect no less g
Got positive reaction and affirmative action
The soul survivor guaranteed satisfaction
Everyday I see the same ol' things
But my true and real live people keep on risin
And it's a shame but business never changes
And my crew knows what to do they're soul surviving
And if I die...
And if I die before I wake I pray go God my soul to take
My crew knows what to do they're soul surviving
And if I die before I wake I pray to God my soul to take
My crew knows what to do they're soul surviving
