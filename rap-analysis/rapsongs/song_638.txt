Bone, Bone, Bone
Wasteland soldiers
These are the days of our lives
(Of our lives, of our lives)
I've been strugglin', hustlin', thuggin' it forever
Come and look deeply in my eyes
I've been strugglin', hustlin', thuggin' it forever, and ever
Bone, Bone, Bone
We gotta prepare, gotta prepare, gotta prepare for eternal warfare
Only time will tell who dies
These are the days of our lives
(Only time will tell)
Come look deeply in my eyes
These are the days of our lives
See the murder mold our lives
(See the murder mold)
These are the days of our lives
(These are the days of our lives)
These are the days of our lives
Now come into my world
And you can see that we are more than thugs
We're more than thugs, we're more than thugs, we're more than thugs
With just a little twist of harmony, we're smokin' lethal warriors
We're warriors, we're warriors, we're warriors
Eternal your thugs
Here I come, tellin' 'em soldier stories
Been daily collectin' my lesson
Went out on a quest and without any question
Stressin', no restin', we journey
This blessin' shiftin' the game, rearrangin' thangs
'Cause most the world was bringin' me down
Mesmerized, controlled by the other side
And the devil was in my town, looking for me
But he won't get me in time, fuckin' with Bone
And he's likin' these rhymes
We rhyme, better believe, it's all the time, nigga
We 'live
We straight up soldiers
(Soldiers)
Better hear what I told ya
(Told ya)
We rob before we go broke, man
We robbin' y'all, all a y'all, all a y'all
Y'all my dogs
If ya call or ya fall, depend on that nigga whenever
And I will be there
Lean on me, but let us get rid of the enemies makin' me sayin'
"Now why, oh, why?", but if you think you can hang, then
Now come into my world, and you can see that we are more than thugs
We're more than thugs, we're more than thugs, we're more than thugs
With just a little twist of harmony, we're smokin' lethal warriors
We're warriors, we're warriors, we're warriors
Thuggin' in the studio, y'all know we roll hydro
Every time we rhyme, I'm high
Look at me deeply in my eyes
I rise to the top of the game
Nowhere did I have to run, now way did I have to turn
Sherm, but a lot of niggas won't learn
But the money that I earn
Won't burn, so come again
Better watch that MAC-10, nigga
This one's for me and my friends
We steadily rollin'
I told ya
Keep bringin' home platinum and gold ones
Pap, pap, put it all on the ground, yeah Bone, yeah
We used to get down with a clack back
(Get down)
Put on the ground, now get down
Well, it must be ghosts who stroll, when I roll
But they ain't gon' get in, though
I'm sittin' alone in my window
Little Eazy, bless his soul, it's so cold
(It's so cold)
Lil' Bizzy got stress from the peeps the streets
And none of these police holice know me
Still wanna him cuffed up, bitch
No peace, no peace
Now, come into my world, and you can see that we are more than thugs
We're more than thugs, we're more than thugs, we're more than thugs
With just a little twist of harmony, we're smokin' lethal warriors
We're warriors, we're warriors, we're warriors
And it ain't no mystery that Biz still be yellin'
Bailin', pullin' into me city
Study Ripsta's scripture, sista, receive me, I'm off
Hey, weeders 'til the end, maybe double me up and get one for my friend
(End)
Twenty-twin, twin, we're biddin' on bud
(On bud)
Start the bid at a fin
So, who wanna bag? Who wanna bag? You wanna bag?
You gotta bag, sold
Send him outta the door to liquor store for the blunts to roll
Only my Lord can tell who dies
So pick up the puzzle and pieces
And put it together of our lives
My Lordy Lord maintain
It's hard 'cause I'm a soldier at war
'Cause everybody wanna try to bring out the devil in me
But they're evil, and better believe weed keeps me at ease
Take notes, oh no, 'cause here it comes
That murder mo comin' to carry you, oh, you, oh
We're lovin' this shit, when they pullin' the gauge out
(Murder)
Hey, they put it up to your temple, and we blow your brains out, die
Now, come into my world, and you can see that we are more than thugs
We're more than thugs, we're more than thugs, we're more than thugs
With just a little twist of harmony, we're smokin' lethal warriors
We're warriors, we're warriors, we're warriors
Only time will tell who dies
Come look deeply in my eyes
See the murder mold our lives
These are the days of our lives
