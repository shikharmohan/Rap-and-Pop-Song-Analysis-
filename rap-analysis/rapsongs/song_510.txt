Krayzie (Verse 1)
We the orginal criminals, therefore they'll be no replications or second guessin'/ The nation thug invasion got these suckas shakin'/ You been waitin' and anticipatin' the makin' and the arrival of my thug congregation, just call 'em Desperado/ It aint hard to spot us, either follow the trials of the hollow shells, as well as the rotten smell of body cells/ How many you niggas is ready to get down and dirty?/ watch me spit rounds like a 30-30..word up!/ Or you can just put on the instrumental and let a nigga run/ It'll be like givin me a gun cuz imma kill everybody 'cause they know I can fuck with the tongue/ I come at the end, explicit, elicit wicked call me Mr..Sawed off will hit cha/ I take time out to beat this shit up, get up/ Feel us it's the real niggas/ The soldier field niggas, roll in control niggas/ and we roll wit cold killers/ So you better back up off us 'fore we blast you off us/ And if you think we jokin' you'll be laughin' in a coffin (coffin..coffin...)
Layzie (Chorus)
You say you work for a couple million dogg (nigga I aint impressed)/ You keep your soilders in the field (nigga I aint impressed)/ A gang of bitches that'll ride real (I ain't impressed)/ This 40-cal will make ya life still (die in ya vest)
Layzie (Verse 2)
See...ya'll the type of niggas that fuck up the party as soon as you get too drunk/ We the type of niggas that chill in the club, ready to get 'em up/ They don't even bring 'em my way, they know it's a fuckin' hustle/ Im strapped up like seat buckles, Im backed up by these muscles, I seen struggle/ A lot of these niggas that say they love you, but better feed the puzzle/ Them same niggas that bring you trouble/ We can rumble in this concrete jungle feelin' the thunder shake the ground/ Better watch out for the ricochet, that boomerangs that laid it down/ Don't you love it when they move chains (chains)/ Nigga was talkin' all flackered and cocky like it was a gon' do thangs (do thangs)/ Shoulda been watchin' the news mayn (news mayn)/ 'Cause deep in the ghetto even a nigga wet up cause that's the rules mayn/ T-shirt and your shoe stained, And other slangin' in the drug game/ Thug game, rap game, We all up under attack mayn/ Operation 'Paper stack', mess with the that and you'll get split/ You know who the fuck this is...Bone Thugs up in, ya dig?
