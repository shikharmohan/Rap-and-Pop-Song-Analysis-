Hallelujah can tell this
Devin's got some shit wouldn't give a fuck if you dissed
Because shit to each's own and each owns voice
You stealin', killin' or chillin' whateva your choice
Smoke some weed, smoke ya pipe fuck it, life if how you live it
I grab tha mic while tha DJ groove it
Explicit lyrics is what I'm known to kick
Trying to make money, can make honeys blow on mah dick
I go on a quick mission to find some kill
Ain't no big deal, just hop in tha Seville
Mah homey put me down quarter pound for a bill
Wake up in tha morning and I have weed still and I chill
With tha brothas sippin' coffee
Too old to be listenin' into what you say so hoe, get off me
You're born in this world by ya self and you die alone
So as long as ya grown, ya might as well gone and just
Do what tha fuck you wanna do
Go ahead and say what tha fuck you wanna say
Do what tha fuck you wanna do
Go ahead and just say what tha fuck you wanna say
What did it all mean? Say what you want hoe, ya grown
You make decisions on your own
No one would suffer but you
So do what tha fuck you wanna do
Now everybody's got elders and you should respect them
They been through similar shit but then again you can't let them
Put they hands on ya life like a remote control
Have you travelin' down tha same bumpy tore up road
Now close friends and relatives they should be constantly by ya side
And understand you gotta let ya conscience be your guide
There'll finally come a time for ya self you must decide
'Cause you only get a ticket, might as well enjoy tha ride and just
Do what tha fuck you wanna do
Go ahead and say what tha fuck you wanna say
Do what tha fuck you wanna do
Go ahead and say what tha fuck you wanna say
And there's a couple of fucked up man made rules that we should follow
But you gotta realize, you just might not wake up tomorrow
And tha dollar you earn is tha dolla you spend
Go get sumthin' for ya kids or buy a bottle of gin
Is it a sin? I don't know, what X and O's in this game
Tryin' to survive, tryin' to get high, tryin' to get by and stay alive
So do it till ya satisfied, not just a lil bit
But wait until ya eighty and start sayin' what you coulda did
But what did it all mean? Say what you want hoe, ya grown
You make decisions on your own
No one would suffer but you
So do what tha fuck you wanna do
Do what tha fuck you wanna do
Say what tha fuck you wanna say
Do what tha fuck you wanna do
Say what tha fuck you wanna say
Do what tha fuck you wanna do
Say what tha fuck you wanna say
