Old McDonald had a farm
Ee-eye, ee-eye, my dick
(Is he dead?)
You can run but you can't hide, I find ya
Just when you think the shit is over, I'm standin' right behind ya
You crossed the wrong muthafucka, now you paranoid
'Cause I'm a nigga these niggas just can't destroy
I'm on the hunt, so keep your shit low but yo
I'm kinda slackin' up
I shoulda killed you from the get-go
Nigga, but this is it
We coulda talked it out like players
But now I'm on some gangsta shit
What possessed this muthafucka to try to punk me?
What possessed this muthafucka to tell me fuck me?
Guess, he thinks that I'm a light weight
Hey yo, your shit's fucked up
So let me help you get your life straight
'Cause niggas get they ass dunked
For fuckin' with me, I ain't no muthafuckin' punk
Punk, I got some good hands but I prefer my gat
Now where you at, 'cause I'ma slit your Kool-Aid pack
See, niggas got it all wrong
Some niggas fake the gangsta shit, so niggas think we all songs
They come up to a muthafucka jokin', man
They wanna test a muthafucka's boxing game
That's when they get they ass trunked
'Cause when you're fuckin' with me, I'ma tear this muthafucka up
You're fuckin' with a dread
You're takin' 2 to your head, I'm comin' fed
(Is he dead?)
Yeah, he dead
It had to be a murder
'Cause I'm a fuckin' killer by nature
It had to be a murder
I looked him in the eye then I shot him in his face
See, niggas make mistakes, black, they shoot
But they don't shoot to kill, so muthafuckas stray back
But I nip it at the bud because I'm not down for dyin'
Muthafucka, so I go for blood
And let 'em know I'm on some real shit
Not with these fake muthafuckas on the team who won't kill shit
I scream it like I mean it, I mean it like I scream it
'Cause, niggas, I done seen it
Muthafuckas with the false nuts, come with the static
And they get they funky ass shot the fuck up
So I give they ass a big blast, instead of turnin'
The other cheek, I get dead up in this bitch ass
'Cause yo, this shit is real life
I'd rather be piped up in a box than be runnin' from a steel knife
So once I put your ass in the red
I'm goin' for the head just makin' sure you're dead
Always look a man in the eye before you kill him
It had to be a murder
Always look a man in the eye before you kill him
It had to be a murder
Always look a man in the eye before you kill him
It had to be a murder
Always look a man in the eye before you kill him
You're dyin', hoe, and can't nothin' save ya
It's over, I'm smokin' on some sweet leaf
Ready to put my dick up in this bitch named Charisse cheeks
A dick-sucker's nightmare, I'm wantin' some action
So I'm rollin' through your hood and I be right there
I blew my horn 'cause I don't knock, the only thing
That's on my mind is fuckin' this bitch and puttin' her ass out
But yo, this shit is breakin' up, she's tellin' homie
She don't wanna fuck, so homie loc is breakin' up
It just so happened homie see my low and now he's madder
Than a muthafucka, 'specially when he see me blown
And now he's got some beef too but yo
I ain't gon' squab my partner over this freak, du
So I cut the shit quick and said
"Yo, we ain't gon' have to come to [Unverified] over this
Freak bitch, if you want her, you can have her because I got
What I wanted, she sucked my dick, so money, you can stab her"
But I said this to myself up, if I told homie
I fucked his gal, then homie nut the fuck up
So I kept it on the down-low and just laid back
And watched the fuckin' reaction of this clown hoe
But this nigga is a real trick, he's talkin' shit
And wantin' to jump off into some ill shit
So I told him fuck him and if he came a little closer
Then I would have to buck him
He came a little closer, so I gave him one
And left the muthafucka stunned and right before I mobbed
I gave him one more for the road, just to finish the fuckin' job
So off with your head, bitch
'Cause I don't fuck around with that 'Return From The Dead'
Shit, I'm makin' sure I get you good and if you twitchin'
Like you still alive, homie loc, I wish you would
'Cause that just gives me one more reason
To grab the trigger of this muthafuckin' pistol
And continue squeezin', I don't believe in second ghosts
You only get one chance, and if you slip, then yo ass is smoked
Some niggas say they feelin' this
But niggas ain't real with this
'Cause nigga roes ain't killin' shit
But yo, I guess it's dead and I be givin' you 2
To your muthafuckin' head makin' sure you're dead
Always look a man in the eye before you kill him
'Cause I'm a fuckin' killer by nature
This is goin' out to all those fake muthafuckas
I ain't gonna say no names
Always look a man in the eye before you kill him
'Cause I'm a fuckin' killer by nature
Always look a man in the eye before you kill him
It had to be a murder
Always look a man in the eye before you kill him
You're dyin', hoe, and can't nothin' save ya
