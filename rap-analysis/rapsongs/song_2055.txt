Yeah, you know what
I like the playettes
No diggity, no doubt
Play on playette, play on playette
Yo Dre, drop the verse
It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got RB, collab' creations
Bump like Acne, no doubt
I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch
A dog couldn't catch me ass out
Tell me who can stop when Dre making moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavor
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers
Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em up open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much ground, got game by the pound
Getting paid is a forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind
I think about the girl all the time
East side to the west side
Pushing phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
As long as she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down, so I can win?
I like the way you work it
(No diggity)
I got to bag it up
  (Bag it up)
I like the way you work it
(No diggity)
I got to bag it up
  (Bag it up, girl)
I like the way you work it
(No diggity)
I got to bag it up
  (Bag it up)
I like the way you work it
(No diggity)
I got to bag it up
She's got class and style
She knowledge by the pound
Baby, never act wild
Very low key on the profile
Catchin' feelins is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Curve's the words, spin's the verbs
Lovers it curves, so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You gotta pay to play
Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trumped tight, all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby, I can get you in my ride
I like the way you work it
(No diggity)
I got to bag it up
  (Bag it up)
I like the way you work it
(No diggity)
I got to bag it up
  (Bag it up)
I like the way you work it
(No diggity)
I got to bag it up
  (Bag it up, babe)
I like the way you work it
(No diggity)
I got to bag it up
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
  (Hey yo, that girl looks good)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
  (Play on, play on playette)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
  (You're my kind of girl, no diggity)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
  (Hey yo)
'Cause that's my peeps and we rolls deep
Flying first class from New York City to Blackstreet
What you know about me, not a motherfucking thing
Cartier wooded frames sported by my shortie
As for me, icy gleaming, pinky diamond ring
We be's the baddest clique up on this scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake ass broads
High shows and proves, no doubt, I be takin' you, so
Please excuse, if I come across rude
That's just me and that's how the playettes got to be
Stay kicking game with a capital G
Ax the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be
Word is born, faking moves never been my thing
So, Teddy, pass the word to your nigga Chauncy
I be sitting in a car, let's say around 3:30
Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity
I like the way you work it
(No diggity)
I got to bag it up
  (Bag it up)
I like the way you work it
(No diggity)
I got to bag it up
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
