There's a light in the darkness
Though the night is black as my skin
There's a light burning bright
Showing me the way
But I know where I've been
There's a cry in the distance
It's a voice that comes from deep within
There's a cry asking why
I pray the answer's up ahead, yeah
'Cause I know where I've been
There's a road we've been traveling
Lost so many on the way
But the riches will be plenty
Worth the price, the price we had to pay
There's a dream in the future
There's a struggle that we have yet to win
And there's pride in my heart
'Cause I know where I'm going, yes, I do
And I know where I've been, yeah
There's a road we must travel
There's a promise we must make
But the riches will be plenty
Worth the risk and the chances that we take
There's a dream in the future
There's a struggle that we have yet to win
Use that pride in our hearts to lift us up to tomorrow
'Cause just to sit still would be a sin
I know it, I know it, I know where I'm going
Lord knows I know where I've been
Oh, when we win, I'll give thanks to my God
'Cause I know where I've been
