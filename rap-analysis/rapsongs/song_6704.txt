[Intro]
Fifteen years in da game man, and I'm still relevant, it's a blessing
It's a fine line how to keep it cool and keep it g
All keeping a g is keeping it cool, and all keeping it cool is keeping it g
[Verse 1]
1992, d cover hit da world and fell in love with snoop
Doggystyle came out, it's like I dropped the bomb
One of the greatest hip-hop records of all time
I was young, gettin' money, livin' wild and free
Got owned and I Brought The whole pound with me 
Didn't matter who's around, I kept it way to G
Niggaz know it was eastside LBC
Gangsta shit, That's what a Mothafuckin' Gangsta Get
The one up above Didn't Like My Pace 
I was movin' too fast Then I Caught That Case
Hm, I fought dat case, wondered where da west would be if I'd have lost That case
I slow ma down, swimin' with da sharks and I almost drowned
[Chorus]
I done made some mistakes long da way, to become da G I am today
Who'd ever thought I'd make it this far, out the hood to be a big star
And I ain't going nowhere, only I ain't ever comin' down
I'm too high in the cloud to ever have to worry 'bout dat
[Verse 2]
I'm finally out, and da critics say they love me cause I went to the south
Said I wasn't gone shine, had me left for dead, switch sides, now my old boss want me dead
Dropped the first of the three, and you said it was weak, No Limit Top Dogg the return of da biz
And from dat point on, I know what to do
Don't worry 'bout them just do what you do
Last Meal was the one who took me off the leash, dats da last time a nigga gonna eat off of me 
Stack Black after black game, mil your soul 
I'm da boss of this bitch and I ain't never went gold, nigga
[Chorus]
I done made some mistakes long da way, to become da G I am today
Who'd ever thought I'd make it this far, out the hood to be a big star
And I ain't going nowhere, only I ain't ever comin' down
I'm too high in the cloud to ever have to worry 'bout dat
[Verse 3]
Boss of da city, boss of da coast, some otha niggaz try but none of them come close
They stuck like a silly , but nothing like a loke 
Da big bow wow, I kill it with one stroke
Dats what it's about, they tryin' a tell a nigga what to come out his mouth
Mothafucka I'm a G, but first I'm a man, freedom of speech, bitch is a word you can't ban
So they blamin' me, saying this my talk, just some women is hoes like it's my fault
Hm, damn they lost, they just don't know dat a bitch is a bitch and a hoe is a hoe
Let them heaters cock  and let them leaders talk
I'mma be smokin Down, Livin Like A Boss 
Let them Heaters Cock and let them leaders talk
I'mma be smoking Down Livin Like A Boss NIGGA
[Chorus]
I done made some mistakes long da way, to become da G I am today
Who'd ever thought I'd make it this far, out the hood to be a big star
And I ain't going nowhere, only I ain't ever comin' down
I'm too high in the cloud to ever have to worry 'bout dat
[Outro]
Too high, too high in the cloud to ever have to worry 'bout dat
Too high, too high in the cloud to ever have to worry 'bout dat
Too high, too high in the cloud to ever have to worry 'bout dat
Too high, too high in the cloud to ever have to worry 'bout dat
Too high, too high in the cloud to ever have to worry 'bout dat
Too high, too high in the cloud to ever have to worry 'bout dat
Too high, too high in the cloud to ever have to worry 'bout dat
Too high, too high in the cloud to ever have to worry 'bout dat
Too high, to ever have to worry 'bout dat
To ever have to worry 'bout dat
No, no, to ever have to worry 'bout dat
No, no, no, to ever have to worry 'bout dat
To ever have to worry 'bout dat
No more, no more, no more, to ever have to worry 'bout dat
I'm too high, to ever have to worry 'bout dat
To ever have to worry 'bout dat
