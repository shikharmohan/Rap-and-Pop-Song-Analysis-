There's a new girl on my street
And I'ma introduce her to my meat
Told my homeboy I was scoping hoping
To crack them legs wide open
Ready to break that thang in half, get it in with the shaft
Take a bath and I'm out, yeah, better keep the Trojan
And if the sex was good, still be the hoe's friend
Fucked around and told my plan to the man
Sitting next to the goddamn man
How was I to know son
That the nigga would run and tell the 411?
With a big fat grin, talking 'bout all the hoes that I ran up in
Broke a nigga's plan like dishes 'cuz now the bitch
Is getting suspicious, she knows I fuck hoes outta habit
Who framed Cube, mothafuck Roger Rabbit
'Cuz I got stabbed in the back by a black ass dirty mack
And if you didn't know it's like that
I got a big fat gat for the dirty mack
Yeah nigga, didn't you know it was like that?
I got a big fat gat for the dirty mack
There goes the bill-board pull it
And see up I'm still #1 with the bullet
What the fuck do I sing? It looks like the Predator
It's getting dissed by the editor
Looked up and hell of white for caper
It's to lynch a nigga on paper
But I'm much too black for the god damn cracker
Huh, dirty macker
Even the Guardian Angels got mental
But never seen their ass walking through South Central
Little super heroes don't lemme catcha, I'll fuck around and wetcha
Try to dirty mack me out, try to take food out my kids mouth
You're luckily that my people stronger than your evil
Or your ass would have got the heave-ho
And you ask where they got the hip hop
At the dope the 187 tag on your toe so act like you know
That nigga that's known to jack
Devils in little red hats, motherfucking dirty macks
And if you didn't know it's like that
I got a big fat gat for the dirty mack
Yeah nigga, didn't you know it was like that?
I got a big fat gat for the dirty mack
Don't come the O.G. way with that 'He say, she say'
Bitch, hit the freeway, dirty mack's get tossed
'Cuz I'll fuck around and jump your ass like Kris Kross
Just might blast ya snake in the grass
Gotta shake up the ass found in a trunk of funk
Tall and stiff as a philly blunt
What more do you want, you done fucked up the plot?
And deserve just what you got
'Cuz I'm hotter than Tabasco, you little asshole
Now I gotta do you like Glass Joe
TKO now you see they flow on cannabis
'Cuz you scandalous, don't know who the man is
Ice Cube a jack, the white ass dirt mack
And if you didn't know it's like that
I got a big fat gat for the dirty mack
Yo, Savage didn't you know it was like that
I got a big fat gat for the dirty mack
I suppose you don't know it's like that
I got a big fat gat for the dirty mack
