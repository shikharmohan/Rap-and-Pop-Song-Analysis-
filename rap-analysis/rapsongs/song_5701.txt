Hello Children
Black Jack Johnson, N.Y.C. R O C K I N G
Sun and the moon, earths, stars and planets
Before song done y'all going, all understand it
Like hot the haters can't fuck with it
'Cause they mom and they sister and girl in love with it
And they niggaz
Sound man holla black come with it
Spin the record 'til the record done spinning
Up top is you getting up with it?
Dirty dirty is you getting cronk with it?
Smokey smoke from coast to coast
Be careful our first draw be that overdose
Who stay holding it from Brooklyn?
You know is Mos ha, Jackpot
I got to go for broke, is this the only way the Smith family now to go
Right here to my youngest one is older folks
I'mma put down like a dirty so and so
Freak daddy came here to work the mojo, oh
Because the high is high and the low is low
And that goes for the sinner man to holy folks
Put your shit in the sky like I know you
Ha, my ghetto nation get toe to toe
Stay rocking steady steady 'cause I told you so
And after y'all get it go I let it go some more
That Black Jack about something for sure, for sure
Say what, for sure, for sure
Let me see you in the world making your shoulder role
And if it get good, tell your nigga throw your 'bows
'Cause we are so ghetto, yes, we are rock and roll
Yes, we are so ghetto, yes, we are rock and roll
Yes, we are so ghetto, yes, we are rock and roll
Yes, we are so ghetto, yes, we are rock and motherfucking roll
Ha, I am a fighter and a lover
I'm the freaky baby daddy, I'm a bad motherfucker
I'm the earth, wind, fire and the thunder
I said, I am, go ask my mama
You don't believe that shit believe what you wanna
Alright, okay, so, shut-up
Speak language, come straight from the gutter
Observe the terms that we trade with one and other
Like what's good, what's poppin', what's crackin'
What it is, how you livin', what's happenin'
Work songs that the slaves sang back then
The playground chants, with little girls clapping
Black John Johnson N.Y.C. R O C K I N G
Son and the moon, earth's, star's and planet's
Before the song done y'all going, all understand it
