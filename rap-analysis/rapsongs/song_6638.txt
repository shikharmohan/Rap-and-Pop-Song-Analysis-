Another smoke session up in this mother****
Blaze some **** up for me Q
Yeah, wussup Dogg
This is what I'm talkin' 'bout
Some of that gangsta ****
Shuttin' these **** up
West coast ****
Quik and Snoop Dogg
9-9 [Incomprehensible]
When I wake up in the morning
And I get up out my bed
I feel good, oh yes, I do
'Cause I still can give it up for you
'Cause we're all a little strong
In the beach, where the paper's long
But as for me I only G when I'm buss'n rocks
Dogg Pound
'Cause we're all a little strong
In the beach, where the paper's long
But as for me I only G when I'm buss'n rocks
Take that, take that
****, you know you gotta have heart
I told you **** from the start
If I'm still in it, I'm in it for life
Always stay down and keep my motha**** game tight
'Cause ever since elementary, or was it pre-school Quik?
I was a motha**** fool
I had to have papers it was routine
A young **** on a mission for them collard greens
I, shake ****, break ****
Make ****, shank themselves for **** with my wealth
(Nigga)
And it'll catch on 'cause if it don't, it's on
And, 'cause, I ain't even slippin' when I'm all alone
I'm sittin' back laughin' in the chronic zone
Clown me ya gone surround me, it's on
Get the money you're gone
My **** paper so long they call him Snoop Capone
So if you want me, get me, got me
Should have shot him but now they call me Snoop Gotti
And that's all I LBC
Betta yet, that's all I DPGC
'Cause we're all a little strong
In the beach, where the paper's long
But as for me I only G when I'm buss'n rocks
Dogg Pound
'Cause we're all a little strong
In the beach, where the paper's long
But as for me I only G when I'm buss'n rocks
Take that, take that
I'm slappin' bones in front of my home
Choppin' game on the phone smokin' a zone
Big 6, big 5-3's with ya ****
My girls in the kitchen, cookin' up some fish and
I'm blastin' at this **** that was trippin'
O, knuckle head ****, thought I was slippin'
But I wasn't slippin', I was on deck
I blast his ****, peck peck now his shirt's wet
Dead, gone, light's out
With no remorse, I had to take him out
I'm laughin' at this **** 'cause it was funny
**** with the Dogg I take your life and your money
And then I dip to my spot
  (Dip dip)
And set up shop with yo rocks
(Motha****)
And nobody gon' speak on the 8-7
'Cause still, all Doggs go to heaven
'Cause we're all a little strong
In the beach, where the paper's long
But as for me I only G when I'm buss'n rocks
Dogg Pound
'Cause we're all a little strong
In the beach, where the paper's long
But as for me I only G when I'm buss'n rocks
Take that, take that
I'm freestylin', C-stylin'
Snoop and Quik comin' through we fin' to take you to the island
Where the **** and the bud come free
And everybody listen to the D O double G
**** on my ****, **** on my nuts
People be lovin' me 'cause I drop cuts
That makes sense, it make big money
See Snoop is that **** who don't hafta play funny
But I got yo honey, up under my wing
'Cause she like the song that the bow-wow sing
I'll put her in a cling, I won't buy her a ring
But I'll put her on the hoe-stroll to make me some green
And even if she never even saw me befo'
There's just no way that she can tell me no
You know my game's unbelievable baby
And it's strong enough to make your grandmama pay me
'Cause we're all a little strong
In the beach, where the paper's long
But as for me I only G when I'm buss'n rocks
Dogg Pound
'Cause we're all a little strong
In the beach, where the paper's long
But as for me I only G when I'm buss'n rocks
Take that, take that, take that, take that
West coast, gangsta ****
