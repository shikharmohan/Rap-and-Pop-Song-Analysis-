Greetings, Earthlings
We have now taken over your radio
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low
Goin' straight through the hole, you ain't got no game
I'm breakin' ya out the frame, comin' through like a train
Lookin' to take over the whole world is my goal
With my unstoppable crew takin' all control
You can't get none of this, we're runnin' this
Well, taker, Earth shaker, 3 point gunnin' this
Get out the lane, I'm comin' through
And if you don't wanna move,  I'm comin' right through you
It's like inch by inch and step by step
I'm closin' in on your position and destruction is my mission
Though eight is not enough, your whole squad better duck
It's like switch when I bust, now your whole crew is dust
Comin' through my area, I'ma have to bury ya
The real scream team on your scream scene
It's like showdown on the range, go tell me who wanna tangle with the
Ghetto witch-doctor neighborhood superhero?
We want it all, unstoppable, we run the floor
You can't get none of this hardcore
In the game we take you to war
You ain't seen nothin' like this before
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low
Insane like a runaway train I'm in your lane
Like it's only 3 seconds to score to win the game
Came to bring the ultimate pain upon the brain
Untamed, you won't like it when I change
And you are type strange
Make room, maniacal, Monstar in the game
And I got my eye on you
Dead shot aim, as free throws keep comin' down like rain
You feelin' me, I'm feelin' you
The Monstar again, I'm tellin' you
Pass me the rock, now, I'm headed to the basket
Get up out my way is what you better do
My tactics is unsportsmanlike conduct
You better ask it
Don't get no better than this, you catch my drift?
You get stripped by ball handlers ruled by swackhammer
Danger, you're dealin' with official hoop-bangers
With hang time like a coat hanger
Jump with thunderous 360 degree type dunks
What up doc? The Monstar Funk
Lightnin' strikes and the court lights get dim
Supreme competition is about to begin
Above the rim, finessin' and moves is animated
Once I get to ballin' I can't be deflated
I'm rugged raw, my Monstars is gettin' money
When clicks get to buggin',  I'm snatchin' up their bunnies
Every step I take shakes the ground
I'll make you break your ankles, son, shake you down
This is my planet, I'm 'bout business
The best that ever done it, can I get a witness?
Cumulus clouds bring darkness up above
You in it for the money? Or in it for the love, M.J.?
23 ways to make a pay, loungin' in the mothership back around my way
I'm 28 light years old, if the refs get political, dribble like Bob Dole
Am I gettin' lyrical? Daddy, I think so
Monstar droppin' flavor fluid so drink slow
We want it all, unstoppable, we run the floor
You can't get none of this hardcore
In the game we take you to war
You ain't seen nothin' like this before
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low
Yo, God bless, pick up your chest
Here's an example, how I can stress your full court press
With finesse, I bench-press your stress whenever you test
We're speed ballin' on the fastbreak just like the Pony Express
I'm gonna mingle in your face and take the label off
Just use your head and forfeit the game
You and your team just need to back off
Get off my block, gimmie the ball, I said it's my rock
I'm startin' a line-up by gettin', y'all to bring the livestock
Throw all your money in the pot
And make sure you bet all your money on my bank shot
When we come right through tell me what you really gon' do?
Well, leave your team name in shame and take your talent from you
While you abandon your ship, we take your championship
With nothin' left for you to see except the instant replay clip
Money spendin', goal tendin', stay-bendin' teams like crash cars
Who do they be? They be The Monstars
We want it all, unstoppable, we run the floor
You can't get none of this hardcore
In the game we take you to war
You ain't seen nothin' like this before
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low
