When i'm down in the studio
tryin' to make a track
my girl be at home and lovin' my back
and everytime I say that's what i'm doin'
she don't think that's what i'm doin'
when it's her that i'd rather be doin'
But right now i'm in the studio
making this track
my girl at home n lovin my back
she blowin' on my phone
she tells me she's alone
I say I won't be long
let me finnish this song
But right now i'm in the studio
eatin' this track
my girl at home beggin' me to come back

and when i get home

But right now i'm in the studio
Man just record me
and even with an equlizer you couldn't pause me

In my office I was a nine to five
but you can be my six to ten

My office i was a nine to five

But right now i'm in the studio
and everytime I try to say that's what i'm doin'
