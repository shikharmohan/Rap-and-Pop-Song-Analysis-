I started with, The New York niggaz got crazy game
And drove the whole motherfucking world insane
I been rolling with my man P R  since the C L.
This is my favorite rap producer nigga on the DL
From mount vern to bx flossin' in the G S
Switchin' lanes tossin' made game to your bitch
Playing the averix? and the Pepe's
No shirt on your girl sweat me and I'ma hit it if she let me
I got my man Pete on the co and that's my dark side
For y'all niggaz that don't know the red bone player
Niggas in the Bronx call me mayor
Maybe because they know I never pay her
Look in your girl phone book it leaves you speechless
Open my number  instead of Peter reads Peaches
Can't be reached because I'm reachless none'll lease this
A fact that I'm black and breechless money peep this
Ya, see even on my block I got to watch my back
Because certain sheisty motherfuckers know I'm rolling with Shaq
And plus I am tall and slim with the joker grin
I bet ya girl knows nigga who the fuck I am
One two rock the house
Come on help me turn it out
I'm getting down for mine so get down for yours
Sending this one out rock steady no doubt
One two rock the house
Come on help me turn it out
I'm getting down for mine so get down for yours
Sending this one out rock steady no doubt
Yo fuck whut them niggaz said there ain't no end to my road
Of yellow bricks being sold to keep me out of the cold
And it's a pity my lingo causes quakes in New York City
Many cases got acquitted 'cause my lawyer's far from shitty
Henney rock sippin' city block rippin' through your vest
Guess who bring your best crew and your techs too
'Cause l gets much liver Lord Tariq
I'm one of the fiercest 85ers kicks no jiver
Because I am a survivor and my rhymes are legal tender
Giving your bitch ass something to remember
So do not return to sender as you enter the Lord's house of prayer
Bow down and say it M B P because I'm your Money Boss Player
I got mad bonanza money marks franc and yen
Enough power to take your crew of soldiers flunk 'em in the end
Who you is and where you been nigga frontin' on the run
But it's done I call you son 'cause you act like one, whut
One two rock the house
Come on help me turn it out
I'm getting down for mine so get down for yours
Sending this one out rock steady no doubt
One two rock the house
Come on help me turn it out
I'm getting down for mine so get down for yours
Sending this one out rock steady no doubt
Aye yo world premier uptown in riot gear
Hall of fame plus all-star game rap career
Got the golden gloves all my niggaz show love
It's Pete Rock y'all same as it ever was
In the Basement treats and prolific beats
Hardcore for the streets take no defeats
My state of the art I demonstrate with heart
Super rap heroes and legendary parks
We battle for a name graffiti tag the 'A' train
Rock steady blood flows deep in the veins
So inject the dope inhale the smoke
Fine tune ya scope for the great black hope
Is back on the scene with the ill team
Open your eyes for hip hop's visine clear va vision
One two rock the house
Come on help me turn it out
I'm getting down for mine so get down for yours
Sending this one out rock steady no doubt
One two rock the house
Come on help me turn it out
I'm getting down for mine so get down for yours
Sending this one out rock steady no doubt
