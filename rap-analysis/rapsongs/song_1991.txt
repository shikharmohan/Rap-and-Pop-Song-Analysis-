Verse 1:
It started of dark, mostly night,
Wouldn't dare let my darkness bring someone light,
I gladly go through it all for the purpose of a lesson,
That will hopefully turn out to be a blessing,
no second guessing,
Let me be an example of how strong this love is,
And to never put anything above his, 'cause what if,
It wasn't unconditional, then what whould we do,
If he did how we do,
We know we wouldn't supose to do the things 
that we did but we did 'em,
And if that wasn't bad enough then we hit 'em,
But you saw it all, So we only ly to ourselfes
Help us, save us from hell,
Let me be!
Chorus:
Let me be your angel, let me be the one for you, 
Let me be your angel, let me be the one... (let me be 2x, let me see!)

Verse 2:
I ask a lot of questions, 'cause I need a lot of answers,
Sometimes I think I need to ask the questions faster,
Surrounded by confusion, am I winning or losing?
Is it because the lifestyle that I'm choosing?
Ups and downs, Right from wrongs,
Goods from bads, Rob out the ghetto all the good I had,
Still I grab, opportunity and ran with it,
And a brother still can't get it, man quit it,
All lives have already been written,
there's no need for asking'
Don't mess with the fruit thats forbidden,
We know god loves us, but don't test faith,
because woulda coulda shoulda are all to late!
Chorus:
Let me be your angel, let me be the one for you, 
Let me be your angel, let me be the one... 
You believe in,
Bridge:
So many nights I felt alone,
Without a friend I want to call on,
Unlike the rain would never end,
Untill you came and found a friend,
And through my ups and my downs,
I have someone to stick around,
Your the reason I keep believing!
Chorus 2x:
Let me be your angel, let me be the one for you, 
Let me be your angel, let me be the one... 
You believe in,
I wanna be, I wanna be ur angel...
