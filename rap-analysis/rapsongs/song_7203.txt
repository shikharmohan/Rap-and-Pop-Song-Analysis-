Won't retire my thrown or surrender no crown

From Summer Hill to the hills up in Hollywood
A house full, gettin to it, you know how we do it (Yeah)
Yeah we smoke great (great)
And we drink good (good)
Then we ball hard, just like G's should
Buy what we want
Drive what we want
G4 up up and away we go, we fly where we want
Haters smile like they like it when they really don't
Wish they could just wish me away
That's what they really want
"I really hate his ass"
"I don't like him either"
"We'll do a song together, maybe then we can beat him"
"Somehow he must be stopped"
"Somethin must be done"
"If we can't knock him off, let's just try him when he get caught with guns"
"Then if he really done (Yeah) and we really won (Yeah)
"Any more ideas? "
"Suggestions anyone? "
"How bout we stay up all night, on the blog sites, spread vicious lies and nasty rumors we could all write"
But that's alright
Let the nerds hate
Cause in my face though, them words get ate
And hatin's hard work, when I just bounce back
This God's work
Tell all the haters I'm back!
What up, what's happenin'
All u haters can get at me (hey)
Cause I hear ya and I'm watchin' (hey)
But I'm still here I ain't stoppin'
So What up, what's happenin'
