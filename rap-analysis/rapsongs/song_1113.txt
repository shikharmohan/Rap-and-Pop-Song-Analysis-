Ha, yeah, yeah
Uhh, yeah, yeah, play at your own risk
Act like you know, I'm on some grown
Ha, yeah, yeah, play at your own risk
Act like you know, I'm on some grown
It's the thelonious, super microphonist
You know us, this rap we 'bout to own it
You know it, these minimes try to clone us
I got a bonus for the that run up on us
I got a bonus for your that run up on us
It's the thelonious, super microphonist
Uhh, no time to sleep 'cuz if you sleep you don't eat
Gotta hold heat, just to make ends meet
Livin' on the street while other feast
Aight wit you it ain't aight wit me
Right, gotta make money all my life
Gotta stay, many types
Yeah you know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Yup, stay turnin' these out, down also, 'em out
Throw somethin' down whenever my out
They know me so they restructure and reroute
They know me from Washington to down South
All the way to London to my common house
Right, it's like a game we never play out, out, out, out
No doubt, get live or get knocked the out
Word up, just be about what you about dogg
Knowhatimsayin', just play at your own risk
Act like you know I'm on some grown
It's the thelonious, super microphonist
You know us, this rap we 'bout to own it
You know it, 'cuz you can feel it in your throat, say it
I'm 'bout to let my mind float, say it
Get your third eye poked, game, I assemble dope
Ness, a that's fresh as the 'fess
Studied this rap, no need to mic test
You can feel it in your chest
Your B I, feel it in her
Plus you, rhyme like a wit his pierced
We lick off lyrics in the streets and real hear us
Dreamin' when I wrote this, box me if I go too wild
Still doin' this like dude in wild style
Invitin' Wack to dinner, I "Trick Daddy" Emcees and I don't know, "Nann"
Who can take it where I take it, you better go into God like Mase did
Leavin' crowds complacent
I move 'em above clouds whether on some surface the earth
Or thug style you can feel it in your body
Yeah, y'all you can feel it in your body
Like if a 12 gauge shottie shell hit your body
You don't want no one to find your a hobby
Carbon copy, tryin' to clone us
You know us, thelonious, super microphone
You know this, rap we 'bout to own it dun, for real
Ay, it's like a ritual
You been invited let the motoebike stimulate the place
With the grace, nevertheless, I stress
Let the music put a smile on your face
As for the ritual, when it comes to spiritual excellence
You know I always leave you with the taste
I know you like it hard to the core
That's what you ask for you aimin' for the best
Hurtin' like a in that like a ritual
Conversation with the most high makes me wanna cry
I wonder why, you wanna get to paradise
But that itty bitty part of you don't wanna die
So pay attention to my word, 'cuz it's the truth
Meditation ease the mind, and brings the youth
It's like a verse you could never read out of a book
Darken the line and your mind like a fish hook
Word is birth, yo I do it till the break of day
Pay attention to your art, never go astray
Word is bond
Yo, we do it and we don't quit
Sucka, you don't want it, it's Thelonious
Ownin' this rap, super microphonist, and we known to spit
I spit fire like Esther on Sanford and son did
I'm raw dude, more juice than Sunkiss
You want this, so MJ kept sayin' the rhyme flawless
Fly like MJ in his prime, "Off The Wall" wit mines
I'm grabbin' my when I rhyme, nine nines bustin' plus
Ball all the time, now stay on your mind like great sex
You ain't on my mind I'm thinkin' 'bout paychecks
Large like an Adex Avirex jacket
Yo the Gods they bust like Latex sex packets
Emcees they don't rhyme and ball, they lyin' to y'all
They dyin' to ball, the rhyme we do all the time
We do all the fine they fall in lines
Me and my mans is somethin' like the source sports
We gettin' money a long time and y'all short
My bounce and full rise and y'alls fall
You funny doo, 'cuz really you think you can do me
When you roll a 500 that's really a 320
Should of let somebody else hook it
Numbers look crooked like King Kong shook it
I'm from where Bang Gats when they celebrate
That's how they play, don't let it be a holiday
Thelonious, if you testin' us we get you laid back
Show you the definition of a pay back
