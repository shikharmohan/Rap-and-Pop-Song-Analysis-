Verse 1:
Gun on me faithfully nina how I adore you,
How I hold you from the side when I control you,
I won't miss,
Don't slip then I get closer and I can't miss,
Stand ova him like a pianist wit no bench,
I hol' da key like Mariah when I fire,
No lip all 4 fif,
Throw clip cuthroat ni99as I know them,
Throw them somethin to wipe out ya hol shyt,
Notice me neva I'm all black,
Masked up Jason,
Part 11 I'm more scarier terror,
I look fear in the eyes like a mirror I don't fear him, (Uh Huhn)
I share 'em wit da rest of da pollbearers..BURRY HIM,
Very low I'm kerosene gasoline,
It's asinine to f*ck wit me,

Climb up motha fu*c*a I'll leave you hung fo weeks yea!......STUPID!
