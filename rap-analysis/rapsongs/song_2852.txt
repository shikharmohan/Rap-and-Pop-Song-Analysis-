In an enemy land
Ack, just by destroying starks enterprises
We could cripple their national defense
So you professor Finkle, the world's greatest expert on electricity
Must devise the destruction of starks' mighty guardian, Ironman
Yo, summer time holdin' the 9, split the Vega in half
Jeeps rumble and my dogs puff grass
Bank stoppin', high-derox hydrolic
The kid with the most knowledge will obtain to touch top dollars
Hold me down, hand me my cake, dusty, bake, activate
Fuck your corny debates, I'm like cake or maybe like 10,000 dollar rabbits
The kid walked thru, switch up his accent now I'm from Paris
Cash the bill, frozen element, sea gal
Signs from the most high causes me to break them all
How the fuck was y'all niggas thinkin'? You think I fell off the ledge?
The legendary ghost Deini might be dead?
Never, impossible, pull out black burners like tonsils
To gallants, hit 'em if we go to bustin' at y'all niggas daily
Wall-to-wall, Hawkins suckin' your teeth 'cuz God chain-talkin'
Like ghostface this, ghostface that
Ghost sold crack, now his revelations spoken thru rap
Valored down like the sheik of Iran
Gasoline cream wrapped in hospital bands
Model vans, Michael Davis, it's me against Housin
Extraordinary pro-black, sold God creations to control thousands
Catch me at the flicks, Apollo rap Fredick Douglas
You know what? Eh yo, fuck this
Eh yo, how can I move the crowd?
First of all, ain't no mistakes allowed
Here's the instructions, put it together
It's simple ain't it, well, quite clever
Marvin, Marvin, you were a friend of mine
You stood for somethin', ugh
Tupac, Biggie, oh how we miss you so
We want y'all both to know we really love you so
Eh yo, I'm Gucci down
Wally boot, Jamaican hat, long 4-pound
Ask niggas how I get down
Don't speak much, deluxe plush
Imaginations holdin' all like Willie hutch
You might've bumped into me on the riker's bus
Weed in my teeths, jem in my beauty sleep, sleeve
Dead serious, knowledge by 2 percent triple geese
Come on, we juggle mic's
We come on all the amps, advance to the final
Show these niggas how the way we dance
Hot night, Jamaica
Came thru in a boger green '68 pacer
Had mad paper, high as a fuck
Truck, 2 rappers got stuck that night
I ain't sayin' no names
They know who, thank you for the change
Outdoor event, new year's eve, Cali weed
30 seconds till we tear and decease
Quick, call all my seeds dipped in the crowd
The hoe spotted me, he knew not to call my name out
He walked off softly, we exactly formed like Christ and His Disciples
Black fatigues, lethal-faced Dunnie, he held the rifle
We had the whole shit shook, you favorite rapper's droppin' they drinks
On the low, tuckin' they links, we made 80 off the books
It's like '86, Magic Johnson, no disrespect
My metaphors'll keep out the projects
Rap connects'll keep me correct
Eh yo, I wrote this on Donnie Roof
After his funeral, on one knee thinkin' his killer's followin' me
So to my nigga Donnie, up there
Can you please tell God that we fucked up here?
You got beer, weed, guns, aids all these obstacles
It's hard to make it nowadays watch the devil in it
Some say it's our fault
If that's the answer, you know smokin' cause cancer
Let me drop a bracelet, leave a chain behind
My tape stay at the beginnin' 'cuz that's how they rewind
Y'all know how we dine, we don't eat swine and we don't drink wine
If you don't bring me some motherfuckin' Cognac, I kill you
I can't feel you ain't in my senses and you ain't in my dollars
I fuck with rock wilders, no leashes, no collars
Brolic scholars, that's Ghost Deini
