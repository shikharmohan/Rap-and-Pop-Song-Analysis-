Yeah, I see you baby girl
I'ma kill these niggas man, yeah
Straight off the block with it
Eagle Street to be specific
I'm peepin' at you people different
I pay my dues, you keep the difference
I can see the end and the beginnin'
So I'm not racin', I'm just sprintin'
'Cause I don't wanna finish
They diminish, I replenish
Scientific, I'm out this world hoe
I wear bright red like a girl toe
No homo, finger nails dirty
I think I'm dirty money since 12:30 am
Wave them if they sure take them
Right back and spray him amen
Yeah, I just do my Wayne
And ev'ry time I do it I do my thang
Yeah, believe that like a true story
Rims big, make the car look like it's two stories
If I hop out that'll be suicide
No backseats, call that paralyze
I don't have a spine, I don't fantasize
I mastermind, then go after mine
You see I handle mine, I dismantle mine
I told her toolbox, bitch it's Hammertime
So excuse me as I nail 'em to something
And just repeal 'em, I'm a kill 'em
Someone tell 'em, I'm a kill 'em
I'ma feel his mother's mama can't tell 'em
And the doctors can't heal 'em, I'ma kill 'em
And yeah, we sell 'em, I know you smell 'em
If you want it, you can just yell it
And I be in the morning at your tele'
Whole ki go a twenty
Half a ki go for eleven
After me there will be nothing
I Am Legend and I Will Smith
Now that's how you let the beat build bitch

Come on, just a snare in the 808
Weezy baby on the mic, he awake
Okay I'd like to thank Kanye
And my nigga Deezle for giving me this diesel
Like a F-350 tank never empty
Damn everybody in the bank act friendly
Used to think my shit didn't stank, boy was I wrong
Approving million dollar deals from my iPhone
I'ma take it 1, 2 way back
Like a silk wife beater and a wave cap
Or the wave pool at Blue Bayou
And I waved fool as I blew by you
Hello, hi you, I can buy you
But I wouldn't try you, feed you to pyru
I know what I'm doing, I sure improved
Show improvement and I know just to go into it
Could never amount to going through it
Whatever, how you want to do it, we can do it like we late
Ay wait, Deezle let me just get the 808
As I hit the kill switch
Now that's how you let the beat build bitch
That's how you let the beat build bitch

And I will eat you alive
Think I'm lying
Damn, I'ma get in the niggas chest like bunch a phlegm
Like a fuckin' ram, I'ma hunt for the lamb
I'm a dump 'em man, in a dumpster can
You ain't a soldier, ask Uncle Sam, hair nappy like Pam
Nigga, fuck your plan, fuck your man
You ain't a pimp unless you get the same bitch
To fuck your man and fuck your clan
And all my bitches know that's my plan
Oh, goddamn, there's my sound
Po playin' like that's my band, gotta get it cleared
Suck my dick with red lipstick and don't let it smear
And I got a lot of tattoos and I meant every tear
And I'm still on that street shit, back to the beat bitch
That's how you let the beat build bitch
Now that's how you let the beat build bitch
Let the beat build, we say yeah, yeah, yeah
And the beat go boom, ba-boom, ba-boom
