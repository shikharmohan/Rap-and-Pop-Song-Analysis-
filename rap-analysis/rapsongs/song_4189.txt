TURN IT UUUUUUP
No regrets at all, I'm high and I hope you catch the fall
Welcome to my lecture hall, you can't shake my infection off
Take me to your leader and, I promise I will be the man
Swim until I see the sand, then die as soon as I reach the land
The water's over our hands, what happened to our plans
Swim until I see the sand, then die as soon as I reach the land!
Chorus
This is my resurrection, so fuck your resolution
I don't need no protection, I don't need your confusion
Don't know what to believe
Don't know what to believe
Don't know what to believe
Don't care what you believe
Cause I'm so over you, yeah I'm so over you
Yeah I fly over you, cause I'm so over you
(Shanell)
Heeeey
I did everything by the book, book, book
Scribblin' all over all of the notes that I took, took, took
Find that your no better than a crook 
Settin' us all up to fall like the twins, you... struck
Show them a picture of my I.D.
Better enough to prove that it's me
Look in the mirror,
Now who should I be...lieve
Chorus
This is my resurrection, so fuck your resolution 
I don't need your protection, I don't need your confusion 
Don't know what to believe 
Don't know what to believe 
Don't know what to believe 
Don't care what you believe 
Cause I'm so over you, yeah I'm so over you
Yeah I fly over you, cause I'm so over you
(Lil Wayne)
