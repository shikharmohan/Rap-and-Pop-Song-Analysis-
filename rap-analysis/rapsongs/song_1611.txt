Don't forget ya niggas
My rep gets bigger
And figgers on my checks
Flex
Like Hercules
When I flow with ease
Usin' lingo that'll bring mo hoes
Front and center
Enta this blissful twist
Full of fun for my niggas
Here's another one
You get a hand shake
And take a copy of the UNA
We're doin' a service
And who are they?
Questions and answers
And we can sure
Capture the spirits in ya soul 'cause the man's pure
And furious
'Cause curiosity killed the cat
Why fill the gat with lead, "Leave a nigga dead?"
But if you was that nigga
Don't sweat me
'Cause if I was that nigga, I wouldn't pull the trigga
Protect yourself but don't project yourself
Into trouble
'Cause, you'll perish, there is
Some things I never forget
Police sweats when we out posted like marionettes
We jets, unless them hands be empty
They lookin' for niggas, yeah
They not allowed to peel me
"Don't forget your niggas"
Don't forget ya niggas
Even if they low down niggas
'Cause I sho found niggas
Down on they luck
Here's a pound and a buck
And you better not spend it on no booze
Choose what is more important
I'm a nigga who will, Ford shit
Before it starts
We score with heart
Artistic values
And I'll use a portion of the brain
Other niggas is ignorin'
Ya snorin'
What's up my niggas
Hi niggas
I figures
I'm the nigga who can rig a rhythm to ya soul
"Plain, simple
Then pull, other tricks out my sleeve
And leave unseen
Clean"
Niggas need to get they shit right
For they step to hieroglyphics it might
Prove fatal
So move, wait till I'm dona
I use fun "Fabrications
For your imagination
Wastin', spillin'
Blood when I'm ill"
Depressed
'Cause I take it out on others
Not the brothers
Just record executives
And I bet you give
Up ya cash
When I leave you with a gash in ya ass
'Cause I had a heart when I started
Now I departed
And I'm back again
Give me ends
'Fore I bust into ya office
Squeezin' triggas
Because you
Because you
'Cause you forgot us niggas
"Don't forget your niggas"
Don't forget ya niggas
Even if they low down niggas
'Cause I sho found niggas
Down on they luck
Here's a pound and a buck
And you better not spend it on no booze
Choose what is more important
Now peep
I knew a nigga that was large
That nigga used to rap good
Now I'm askin' him
Perhaps, could you tell me how you fell off
Yet you was well off
But now the real niggas think ya soft
'Cause we beat rhymes
You can't keep up with the times
It seems you have styles combined
From other fools
And you'll discover who will be a real nigga
You da man
You supposed to skill niggas
When you say you will
You don't display you skill
And still you throw your niggas out the doors
Scores of years ago, you was bros
But now you got a little dough
And yeah, you tryin' to play him like a hoe
But I don't think so, he ain't a puppet
Enough with that shit, take that job
Stuff it, up ya ass
Just gimme enough for gas
I'm rough, "I can last
And get my own phuckin' cash
Well that's that"
And what do you get for that?
Ooh, you dirty rat
How could you forget the fool
That was down wit ya in school
Ya'll use ta shoot pool
Ya sorry busta
Never could trust a
Nigga think, he's so large
That nobody can thrust him
Out the pilot seat, ejected
You forgot ya nigga
Ya assed out
Expect it
"Don't forget your niggas"
Don't forget ya niggas
Even if they low down niggas
'Cause I sho found niggas
Down on they luck
Here's a pound and a buck
And you better not spend it on no booze
Choose what is more important
