I feel so zigidy, zigidy, zigidy, 'cause I'm floatin' in ecstasy
I feel so zigidy, zigidy, zigidy, 'cause I'm floatin' in ecstasy
I feel so zigidy, zigidy, zigidy, 'cause I'm floatin' in ecstasy
I feel so zigidy, zigidy, zigidy, 'cause I'm floatin' in ecstasy
As you can see, I took the pill right to the house
(I took the pill)
Grabbed a shot of liquor and pop, pop, popped it in my mouth
And I'm thinkin' to myself that this might be a waste of my time
'Cause what if I don't even get high
Thirty minutes done came by, I didn't even seem high
Until I stood up and looked at the ceilin' for some reason
Now I'm tweakin', then I tried to walk but I was slow
I guess I'm floatin' in ecstasy
(Just like the nigga told me)
I feel so pillish, pillish, pillish, 'cause we floatin' in ecstasy
I feel so pillish, pillish, pillish, 'cause we floatin' in ecstasy
I feel so pillish, pillish, pillish, 'cause we floatin' in ecstasy
I feel so pillish, pillish, pillish, 'cause we floatin' in ecstasy
My name come alive, be told
And I'm pokin' in somethin', oh damn but it ain't no joke
Cut guards and red beans
And for them niggaz that follow me around for my mojo
Feelin' so see,'cause I'm floatin' in ecstasy
(Alright)
Ah, my nigga just call up the homey to hook us up on that liquid G
And if these hoes don't wanna see, they gotta check the spot quickly
I'm feelin' way high, but I'm also feelin' way low
But damn, I'm stuck in between
Fuckin' with broad boys and never get used
Just help, just throw in a few more diablos
Nigga, Flesh Bone so chill
I'm feelin' it hump through my body, feelin' hot and exotic
Feelin' knocked out, feelin' too sexy for my motherfuckin' self
Gotta find my bitch and fuck her ass to death
I feel so pillish, pillish, pillish, 'cause we floatin' in ecstasy
I feel so pillish, pillish, pillish, 'cause we floatin' in ecstasy
I feel so pillish, pillish, pillish, 'cause we floatin' in ecstasy
I feel so pillish, pillish, pillish, 'cause we floatin' in ecstasy
Whose my nigga that told me the level?
I started to see the devil, nigga was floatin' in ecstasy
Shit, I took the pill, couldn't feel nothin' so I'm breakin'
But about thirty more minutes later, nigga was on the couch fainted
Arms sweaty, man why in the fuck ya'll let me do this?
I'm lookin' at my home girl like I want her, nigga this some new shit
I realized, nigga took one step and started stumblin'
And I was tryin' to call my nigga but he couldn't hear me
So I guess I'm mumblin', fall off into somethin'
But I guess I'm on a mission
Tellin' my niggaz that I love 'em now but it ain't nobody listenin'
Whistlin', hangin' out tha window, need me some indo
'Til I let go, like, me silky fine-ine, ine
Flown the expo, knock, knock, knock at the door
But nigga was paranoid, so I grabbed my gun bucked it at the door
Ooh-wee, shit happens, my family got me faded
But I'm runnin' a secret cous', 'cause a nigga can't take it
Shake it, if I can but I blend in with the killers
And I wish E was here to feel pillish
(Pillish, pillish)
I feel so violent, violent fuckin' with that ecstasy
(Come roll with me)
I feel so violent, violent fuckin' with that ecstasy
I feel so violent, violent fuckin' with that ecstasy
(Come roll with me)
I feel so violent, violent fuckin' with that ecstasy
I've been smokin' weed for a very long time, why should I change?
And plus they say that ecstasy shit fucks up the brain
(Brain)
Ah, why should I just to get high, weed gets me high
(Weed gets me high)
"Nigga try this here", they said, "Better than that there"
They say, "Ya like it", so I tried it
(Ya like it, I tried it)
I thought the shit'll have a nigga high and horny
I'm high, but I'm too high, I wanna hurt somebody
Nigga you trippin', get a hold of that shit and ride that high
But I'm trippin', body moves, won't nobody get hurt
(Hurt)
Groanin', groanin', groanin' and she ain't even in the car
Layzie won't believe we high off the LSD
Would ya' slow down, we ridin' on the highway
Get the wheel, so I can go down on ya, I sever it on my own way
(Ah)
She reachin' feelin' so zigidy, zigidy, zigidy
Got these bitches, fuckin' them bitches
Baby, be peeled off, peelin' on, movin' slow
And Bizzy be rock hard, tongue well and mean slow
We in the club drunk, fucked up, and still rollin'
They know my pockets swollen, hold up, show them we rollin'
We rollin', rollin', rollin' and rollin', rollin', rollin'
I feel so zigidy, zigidy, zigidy and we rollin' on that ecstasy
I feel so zigidy, zigidy, zigidy and we rollin' on that ecstasy
And we rollin' on that ecstasy and we rollin' on that ecstasy
And we rollin' on that ecstasy and we rollin' on that ecstasy
Fuck it, gimmie a pill nigga
Oh shit, oh shit
