This life will fade away, so I'd appreciate
Each moment of each day
Life's quick, don't flip, move slow you're rushing it
Looking lavish, I lace all my bunnies with carats
Spending millions then making music, I pay for the clearance
'Cuz tomorrow ain't promised and my bank roll is burstin'
Connects with Aston Martin
I be the first in that prototype truck with the space navigation
Cost of living go up, I just go on vacation
Fresh oxygen tanks, got world renowned surgeons
Plush robes made from suede and knitted by virgins
First breath of the day could be my last
So I flash, give my niggas some cash, I just pull out the stash
Buy a million dollar piece like I buy a pack of C's
You buy oz's of haze, I buy a forest full of trees
This life will fade away, so I'd appreciate
Each moment of each day
Life's quick, don't flip, move slow you're rushing it
Order that bottle of that Louis the 13th, plus some Don P
I got a bunch of chicks that love to get raunchy, see
Tone double dippin', I nut like Flanders
Ask Tavia and Chavon, I got them both goin' bananas
Buying frosted bracelets, Louis Vuitton duffles
French vanilla ice cream and hot apple pie truffles
Fly Mica to Costa Rica, I got a crib on the beach
With underwater lights and surround sound speakers
Pet cheetahs, tiger sharks and dolphin feeders
Fly French maids, serving Grey Goose by the liters
Got Felicia and Tequisha, Krystal with Katie
Little Precious picking my poppy seeds out in Haiti
This life will fade away, so I'd appreciate
  (Slow down, I need money though)
  (Know what I'm saying? This is what I do, on the streets)
Each moment of each day
   (Ya know what I mean? Babies need Pampers, man)
Life's quick, don't flip, move slow you're rushing it
  (You know what I'm saying? I don't know)
Slow down, slow down
  (I think about it)
Slow down, slow down
Slow down, slow down
  (I think about it, ya know what  I mean?)
Slow down, slow down
  (Responsibilities, I've gotta focus more)
Slow down, slow down
  (You might be right though, you know)
Slow down, slow down
  (Maybe things'll start coming to me naturally, feel me?)
Slow down, slow down
  (Starting praying more)
Slow down, slow down
  (Ya know what I mean? Be with the family more)
Slow down
  (And I might live longer, you feel me?)
  (Word, it feel like you right, though)
Slow
  (I don't know)
Life's quick, don't flip, move slow you're rushing it
  (I'ma take your advice though)
