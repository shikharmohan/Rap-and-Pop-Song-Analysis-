For as long as I remember I've been tellin' y'all, man
To pull these nigga resume, you better check up on me, nigga
These niggas be lyin', man
These niggas ain't really kickin' this shit they be tellin' y'all, man
They wanna see y'all gettin' fucked up right there, man
Keep ya eyes on me, nigga
Don't believe what these niggas tell ya, man
These niggas ain't cool, what they rap about these niggas ain't do
Hear 'em say it but it really ain't true
You niggas ain't true, you niggas ain't really talkin' to 'em, we no fool
You better take your ass to school
'Cause these niggas ain't G, gangstas' something these niggas can't be
What you expect? These niggas ain't me
You niggas ain't rich, you niggas ain't really gettin' bricks
It's official, man, you niggas ain't shit, tell 'em I said that
He nigga lying every time you hear him rhymin'
He don't talk about they diamonds and how they be out there shinin'
For the rap, hey, we're trappin', tell y'all they be at their grind
And I know they ain't about that action, I'm tellin' ya I'm a ride 'em
They pro'lly try to come in the hood and sell weed
Think it's all good until they run into some real G's
Holla, tell us where it is and I promise we'll leave
Hesitate to say and boy, [Incomprehensible] we'll squeeze
Please pay attention to this part of the bull
One time got robbed, got shot, got shooked
Got a job, started rhymin', came up with a hook
Got a chain' and some tats, came up with a look
Went and made it here, ruckin' talk tough in a bull
Fuck the image and perception, they never tough as they look
They some muthafucking suckers, put it on whatever
Any real nigga no better, man
These niggas ain't cool, what they rap about these niggas ain't do
Hear 'em say it but it really ain't true
You niggas ain't true, you niggas ain't really talkin' to 'em, we no fool
You better take your ass to school
'Cause these niggas ain't G, gangstas' something these niggas can't be
What you expect? These niggas ain't me
You niggas ain't rich, you niggas ain't really gettin' bricks
It's official, man, you niggas ain't shit, tell 'em I said that
You can't tell them niggas
Ain't surely gettin' caught with a nigga, gon' tell
Them nigga don't sell, this your G ain't gotta put it from a scale
He ask you if it weigh enough, just tell 'em, "Yeah"
You nigga just yell, pull the pistol, them nigga gon' bail
And if he got a pistol bet he don't spray it
They don't wanna go to jail
In there he know he'll be walkin' on shells
The gladiator school is you prepared?
I can see these niggas scared
Got a problem with me, nigga, just say it
We can play it how you wanna play it
Better go ahead, forty pistols be aimed at your head
All the way down and where you gon' lay
Jean really on the edge, Jean ain't under suspicion of the Feds
You just tellin' them you is instead
You never brought his head
What you get behind the mic and just said
The people already know I must say it, man
These niggas ain't cool, what they rap about these niggas ain't do
Hear 'em say it but it really ain't true
You niggas ain't true, you niggas ain't really talkin' to 'em, we no fool
You better take your ass to school
'Cause these niggas ain't G, gangstas' something these niggas can't be
What you expect? These niggas ain't me
You niggas ain't rich, you niggas ain't really gettin' bricks
It's official, man, you niggas ain't shit, tell 'em I said that
You damn right, these niggas don't have rights
To rap about the shit I did every night
Did you win every fight? You ever went to jail for sellin' white?
Made barbecue and trap the same night
You know these niggas lyin', right? I'm speakin' on it 'cause it ain't right
Nigga died, I survived by the nerve of my strife
Went to jail, came home twenty times, got it right
But still tryin' to keep for shootin' sucker niggas I don't like
'Cause the game feel like the real niggas on strike
This sucker get a deal, now he livin' so shy
The niggas outta sight, actin' hard, lyin' on their record
Know it when you see, you recognize it, don't respect it
Got every right to check 'em when you see 'em in your city
Run up on 'em and try 'em, bet you see that they're some bitches
Niggas tell you what they want you to hear
Don't tell me, real recognize real, eventually they'll see
These niggas ain't cool, what they rap about these niggas ain't do
Hear 'em say it but it really ain't true
You niggas ain't true, you niggas ain't really talkin' to 'em, we no fool
You better take your ass to school
'Cause these niggas ain't G, gangstas' something these niggas can't be
What you expect? These niggas ain't me
You niggas ain't rich, you niggas ain't really gettin' bricks
It's official, man, you niggas ain't shit, tell 'em I said that
