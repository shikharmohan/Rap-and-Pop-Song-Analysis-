Huh, boom
Huh, guess who it is?
Huh
I rock, I roll
Tear this motherfucker up
Let's get ready to rumble
I come in this bitch to get paid to bust flow, I come for the gumbo
They know me for kickin' they ass from here to El Segundo
Let's get ready to rumble
Shit sparks, spit flames the coldest thing up under the sun though
Spendin' your money on them niggaz
You're wastin' you time 'cause I'm the one hoe
Smokin' the blunt smoke, stay out of my bundle
I swung with the blast, I've never been matched
I hop on the track like a jump rope
I come with the guillotine to cut throat
Holdin' it down, fuckin' y'all up
But the rest of them suckers be unsho'
Me? yeah, I'm blessed, if you don't know
Pack a big boner, heavy structured and hung low
Wreckin' ball nuts and dick touch the flo'
If it's on yo' chest then bitch let me know
I hope you don't think I'm a runnin'
I know you don't think I'm scared
You must of forgot who the fuck that I am
The man with the braids, beware
That's yo' ass Mr. Postman
Got them niggaz stompin' and swingin' with both hands
I rock, I roll
Tear this motherfucker up
Let's get ready to rumble
Shuttin' systems down
You ready for war?
Start somethin', start fightin'
I rock, I roll
Tear this motherfucker up
Let's get ready to rumble
Shuttin' systems down
You ready for war?
I rock, I roll
Tear this motherfucker up
Let's get ready to rumble
Shuttin' systems down
You ready for war?
Bats and pipes, broken bottles, glass, and knives
Jump in the mix and don't handle yo' business
And a nigga gon' turn out yo' lights
You'll be gettin' yo' stupid self up
Askin' the people "which one of y'all hit me?
I don't know the way you went down looked like the ground was slippery
Attack 'em with sawed offs, and niggaz get throwed off
The party get called off, when niggaz get sawed offs
Go get my meat to meet and give me that raw dog
You, go get you a nasty, givin' that pussy you bought off
I come with the real
I be with them niggaz with booted up grills
We don't do promotional shows that shit don't pay my bills
Keep it in the ballin', ballin', promoters callin'
Videos jumpin' off nigga this the real New Orleans
My neck of the woods, my side of the hood my part of town
Thugs, drugs, and violence y'all niggaz is watered down
When I perform I'm that calm
And I'm the shit on the record I hit the studio and show 'em
I rock, I roll
Tear this motherfucker up
Let's get ready to rumble
Shuttin' systems down
You ready for war?
I rock, I roll
Tear this motherfucker up
Let's get ready to rumble
Shuttin' systems down
You ready for war?
I rock, I roll
I roll, we by hype
Knockin' 'em out, throwin' 'em away, keep 'em off
Takin' 'em out, bustin' they head, breakin' 'em off
I rock, I roll
Tear this motherfucker up
Let's get ready to rumble
Shuttin' systems down
You ready for war?
I rock, I roll
Tear this motherfucker up
Let's get ready to rumble
Shuttin' systems down
You ready for war?
I rock, I roll
Tear this motherfucker up
Let's get ready to rumble
Shuttin' systems down
You ready for war?
