I drinks it all the time it's extra satisfying
Three of four times a day you can catch me drivin
Back and forth to the liquor store buyin
Jugs and jugs of tha shit cause I'm addicted wit no denying
Perving, swervin rannin all into the fuckin curb and
If I get one more d.u.i. then it's curtains
I can't cope, I guess I'm a alcoholic sometimes I hit the chronic
It's just like gin and tonic when it's time to get erotic
5.99 For a big ass bottle of rossi wine it's right on time
Once you become a member of my drinkin' club you will find
The key to set ya free so give it a try
But don't mistake it for chablis unless you already high
Spread the word get sprung and drink it with ya down chromes
That's another word for sohobs, potna, folks, homies
Every motherfuckin' year
We do this shit every other fuckin' day if not every day
But anyway I want
Top of the line wine, carlos rossi
