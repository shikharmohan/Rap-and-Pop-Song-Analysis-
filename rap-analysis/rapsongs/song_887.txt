Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Turn my music up, turn my music up
Truck shit now, truck shit now
Truck shit now, truck shit now
Turn my music up, turn my music up
Truck shit now, live nigga bully foot
Brass knuckle rap shit now
Check it out now, yeah yeah
Relax that shit you talk
Before I sic my bitch on you
Let her bounce wit' your dick on a fork
I bring a bigger storm to calm your clouds
I own a couple things I even own a farm wit' cows
I own a moment when my niggas run deep through crowds
Like how a pregnant woman breast milk leak through her blouse
A lot of niggas love to wish on a star
Give a fuck who you are
I know some niggas that'll piss on ya car
Now see every time we step in the place
I give y'all niggas shit that put a fowl look on ya face
Rock ice like I was never more able
Don't drink coffee 'cause my diamonds be cuttin' the glass on the table
Hey, I be the lost found tribe of shabazz
Bless niggas then I plant another bomb on ya ass
And then I put my students all in a class
To clear my ruler ship and leave y'all niggas fucked up doin' the math
One time now
Truck shit now, truck shit now
Turn my music up, turn my music up
Truck shit now
Truck volume, truck volume
I know you wanna get up on it
Let me show ya how we do
Every time we drop that shit
You know we put it down for you
Hey, hey
How many times you gonna crush down something
You need to change ya name up to buss a buss down something
Ya fuckin' with the highest, my nigga
Tryin' to fuck wit the giant might as well call me Goliath, my nigga
Come on, drop hot shit on the spot, sop it up wit a mop
Before the hungry come and shop on ya block
I know some niggas that'll love to blood suck you all
A thing of the past because them niggas stuck you all
One shot bust on the same bullet struck you all
And when they bounce you hear voices screamin' fuck you all
Gathered up about a thousand young bucks who brawl
It's decoys in case he needed to duck you all
That's why you betta move tight wit' ya click
Niggas be thirsty and quick just to be out before the night wit' ya shit
We keep it street and give a damn who you are
Make niggas wild and bitches spread and put they hands on the car
Now let me frisk 'em and shake they asses down to the floor
While dude wonderin' what them niggas is poundin' me for
What them niggas grillin', what them niggas houndin' me for
And for the pound and what them
What them niggas was surroundin' me for
Well, let me tell you what the fuck
We was surroundin' you for
We came to get you once
Well, now I come to get you for more
While your gettin' got
Niggas drinkin' ten dolla Hennessey shots
Gettin' drunk and wildin' out in the spot
What the fuck now
Truck shit now, truck shit now
Turn my music up, turn my music up
Hot shit now, street shit now
Truck volume
I know you wanna get up on it
Let me show ya how we do
Every time we drop that shit
You know we put it down for you
I know you wanna get up on it
Let me show ya how we do
Every time we drop that shit
You know we put it down for you
Hey, hey
