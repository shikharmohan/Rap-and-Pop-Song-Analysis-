I just wanna be your super woman
Wanna keep you goin', wanna make you smile
I'm the one that's gon' be faithful to you
And without you, come on, let me show you how
Baby, don't you know you drive me crazy?
'Bout to have your baby  'cause I love your style
Boy, I never wanna let you go
Gotta let you know, we could start right now
Through thick and thin to the end
If I ran out of money, no dividends
If I had to do time, if I was up in the pen
Would you still be my lady, would you still be my friend?
No matter how tough it get, no matter whatever matter
Are you gon' still have my back like a chiropractor
Through sickness, through health, for better, for worse
Till the day that they haul me off in a hearse?
Our world is as big as we make it
Let's make the best of it, darlin', let's celebrate it
We too real to be phony, why should we fake it?
We too dumb to be lonely, let's elevate it
We could reach for the stars, the outer limits
Would you share with me if you had the winnin' lottery ticket?
I need the kinda broad that they don't make
The kind that know how to cook and communicate
I just wanna be your super woman
Wanna keep you goin', wanna make you smile
I'm the one that's gon' be faithful to you
And without you, come on, let me show you how
Baby, don't you know you drive me crazy?
'Bout to have your baby  'cause I love your style
Boy, I never wanna let you go
Gotta let you know, we could start right now
I'm not a rescue Roni, I'm a Mack-aroni
My Mack game is impeccable, no baloney
But you done lifted on a player so tough
So that you never player wanna put his pimped up ride
I'll be hard headed, super thug
You want me at home but I'll be at the club
Gettin' whiskyed then perked and gettin' tipped
Whatever club is wherever I be gettin' killed
I'm a managed person, super perkin'
This is how I eat, mama, see I be networkin'
I stay in the traffic, I'm all about my Gs
Put your clothes on, darlin', let's go to Tommy T's
The comedy club up in the Contra Costa
Offa Willow Pass Road up in Concord
I ain't a pretty boy and I ain't ugly
If a broad got in my face would you scratch her up off me, uh?
I just wanna be your super woman
Wanna keep you goin', wanna make you smile
I'm the one that's gon' be faithful to you
And without you, come on, let me show you how
Baby, don't you know you drive me crazy?
'Bout to have your baby  'cause I love your style
Boy, I never wanna let you go
Gotta let you know, we could start right now
No, I ain't ever gonna let you go, no, no
Never, never gonna let you go, no
I ain't ever gonna let you go
Gotta let you know, we could start right now
You remind me of my favorite instrument, a guitar
Or my favorite vehicle, a Chevy SSR
I'm a cursed superstar, we go together like a drink at the bar
Like Tiger Woods in the back of 9 par, trust that
I know you the type to stand tall through it all
Let's splurge a little, let's me and you hit the mall
I'll get you the Stella McCartney jeans and boots
You get the Steve Harvey line collection suit
We could juggle some bills and use our skills
We could sell a few pills to make a few deals
However, whatever to get the scrill
Whatever it takes for us to get over the hill
I just wanna be your super woman
Wanna keep you goin', wanna make you smile
I'm the one that's gon' be faithful to you
And without you, come on, let me show you how
Baby, don't you know you drive me crazy?
'Bout to have your baby  'cause I love your style
Boy, I never wanna let you go
Gotta let you know, we could start right now
I just wanna be your super woman
Wanna keep you goin', wanna make you smile
I'm the one that's gon' be faithful to you
And without you, come on, let me show you how
Baby, don't you know you drive me crazy?
'Bout to have your baby  'cause I love your style
Boy, I never wanna let you go
Gotta let you know, we could start right now
We could start right now, uh
We ain't gotta wait till tomorrow
Not another second, not another minute, hey, no
We could start right now, yeah
Right, right now, right, right, right now, ooh, now, yeah
