It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood
All's well that ends well
Outside watering their lawn and you know
Birds are chirping, dogs are barking, it's beautiful
That may be your hood but this is my hood
(It's my hood *** let's go)
Got the red dogs trippin' and these n***** still snitchin'
The old lady across the street still snitchin'
It's 3 in the mornin' take your old *** to sleep
The third time she's called the police this week
Lookin' at my Franck Muller, it's about that time
Your folks just left so I'm on my grind
Said you wanna two-fifty 'cause you need that nine
I want that bread but I don't need that dime
Charger fresh out the shop with that suicide doors
Swear I died and came back alive
With 22 inches all under the frame
Keep my pocket full of bread, you'll *** know the name
Jeezy like to drink, Jeezy like to smoke
Jeezy like to mix arm and hammer with his coke
Jeezy at the trap, Jeezy like to grind
Jeezy 'bout his paper 'cause Jeezy like to shine
Jeezy like to drink, Jeezy like to smoke
Jeezy like to mix arm and hammer with his coke
Jeezy at the trap, Jeezy like to grind
Jeezy 'bout his paper 'cause Jeezy like to shine, so
Sold those squares yeah, I cooked them o's
Guilty as charged yeah, I rock them shows
I can't even lie yeah
Trapped all day spent it all on clothes
Shop all day till the mall is clothed
Come back to the trap to get my pockets swell
Fruitopia, smoke blueberry
Mix it with the purp, we call it cranberry
The Bin Laden clips yeah, they came with the chopper
Got a slick mouth, I hope you came with a doctor
The boy stacks cheese like it came with the whopper
Stay fly like I came in a chopper, what's up

Jeezy at the trap, Jeezy like to grind
Jeezy 'bout his paper 'cause Jeezy like to shine, so
Ain't *** shakin' but the leaves in the trees
Between me and you I got a deal on the ki's
Six in one run, laid a mil on the trees
Hit the broad every night, keep a plug on the white
Mr. 17 5, you *** know the name
Why y'all playin', y'all know it ain't a game
This is me ***, why would I ever change
A hundred and twenty carats, you *** see the chain
I'm a bathing ape fanatic, red monkey junkie
Glass pots on the stove, got the kitchen smellin' funky
I sold a million records but I still flip them blocks
On the TV every day but I'm still pop them glocks
Jeezy like to drink, Jeezy like to smoke
Jeezy like to mix arm and hammer with his coke
Jeezy at the trap, Jeezy like to grind
Jeezy 'bout his paper 'cause Jeezy like to shine
