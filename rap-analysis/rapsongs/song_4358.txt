Chorus: Joe Young
When I was broke as a joke people use to hate on me,
Now Im on I don't need your money,
Homie imma be iight (be iight, be iight)
Homie imma be iight (be iight, be iight)
Back in the day shawty wouldn't give me play,
Now its hard to keep shawty away,
But shawty imma be iight (be iight, be iight)
Shawty imma be iight (be iight, be iight)
Verse 1: Lil Wayne
Ughhh
Young tune, no animation,
Bitch I do me like master bastion,
Young money cash money til im killed nigga,
Bet my funeral be over packed with real niggas,
Started  on the black top,
With few pieces of crack rock,
Now its just hip hop in this motha fuckin black rock,
Earn my stripes like a motha fuckin black sox,
Now its like I can hit the motha fuckin jackpot,
Hurricane Katrina is the motha fuckin back drop,
Man you know them niggas got that motha fucker back hot,
Im trying to see how to get that new barrack lac drop,
Imma be iight, iight,

Homie imma be iight (be iight, be iight)
Back in the day shawty wouldn't give me play,
Now its hard to keep shawty away,
But shawty imma be iight (be iight, be iight)
Shawty imma be iight (be iight, be iight)
Verse 2: Joe Young
Whoever young no explanation,
Bitch I do me till I reach my destination,
I'm coming up nigga what's your occupation,
I talk to you simple never lost in translation,
No Need to wait cuz I will show up late,
Sold out seats to hear me articulate,
Great,
Nigga its faith,
 I am where I need to be I do it great,
All lean dat sheets to me,
My mother never imagined what her words mean to me,
If shes down she call me she knows she can lean on me,
Living this life how I dreamed it to be (x2)
