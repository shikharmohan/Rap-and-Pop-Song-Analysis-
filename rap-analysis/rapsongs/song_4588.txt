(This here is Streets)
They say powder makes you hyper 
Reefa makes you calm
Cigarettes give you cancer
Wowos make you dawn
While I sip da purple all as thick as my Southern drawl
Put me on the ocean floor wit' the mermaid wit' no draws
They got bats up in the cave
Upside down 
Blood rushin' to they head
They reactin' off sound  
As I stand on the mound
Pitchin' for the crown
Uptown down face painted like a clown
Recitin' scriptures from the chapters 
Proverbs lavidicates 
Old ass rappers 
Complainin' what the business is  
'Bout the state of hip
Soundin' like some bitches
Hop your ass off a rich nigga dick it's ridiculous 
The new school nigga
What you need to do is become a resident of the condition
Get yo' ass off of yo' ass and get yo' ass up on a mission
Become some competion
Like federal and the dog
Young Money nigga we ball 
Like Kobe and Chris Paul
For givn' the whack crackas
Still sippin' Crystal
Wavin' the life line since life's a bitch 
Y'all raisin' up the skirts of desert bells for no cash like 
Bitch gimme that ass
Pullin' up to the lot like 
Gimme that Jag'
No pullin' up to the lot like
Gimme that Lamb' 
Study me add me like a final exam
If I hit you in your back you need a spinal exam
I'm somethin' like a rhino wit' ram 
Animal, beast 
Irritate you pussies like plamidium yeast
Y.M. militia you niggas betta retreat 
Or be like this beat
R.I.P. diseased 
[Lil' Wayne]
I'm a killa 
Hey I'm a killa 
Huh I'm a killa 
Yeah I'm a kill
Yeah I'ma killa 
I'm a killa 
I'm a kill 'em
Yeah already
Yeah betta call every paul barrier
In your area
The ball carrier gon' get popped
If I'm commin' 'round da block
And swing drive get stopped
He gon' drop like a flop
On the court I love sports
That's why I play my bitches
Cuz I got game 
That's why you pay my bitches
Yeah, same hustle new money
I ain't just hip hopin' like two bunnys
Who run it?
Bitch nigga muah
That was French nigga not
A kiss nigga naw
Yeah no homo
Rapas get ate 
Like four on four
They say I fuck so and so
And I be like so so and so
Nikes on they neck they like let me breath
I'm sorry but I can't 
This is how we feed
This is why we hot 
This is how we freeze
To fast to follow
This is why we lead
And the money in the pockets isn't why we G's
See this is how we shoot
And this is how we leave
Only toe steel
This is how we ease in
You can get the steel
If you try these things
Now pass me the Swisha
Let me climb these trees
And the hatas say we couldn't
This is why we beast
This shit like puddin'
Puttin' it down like gravity's pullin'
Puttin' it down like gravity's pullin'
Puttin' it down like gravity's pullin' me to the ground
Young 
Young 
Young 
Young Moula crazy (Young Moula crazy)
Remember that
