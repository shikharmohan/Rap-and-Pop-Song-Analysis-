I walk around acting strange, like a man in a daze
  (Get the mic on, I don't know what happened, son
  (I just lost my mind, son)
People talking to me and calling my name
  (Ay, ay, it's like I wasn't strong, G, I couldn't hold it when I seen it)
  (A nigga flesh on me, I can't really, I couldn't hold it, G)
No, I don't hear a word they say
  (I don't know, I'mma, listen, no I went like this, nigga)
It was him, the corner store and a buttered roll
The shit dropped when I gave him two stomach holes
One to the face, he fell sideways
I was up close, so part of his nose was stuck to my padres
Standin' over him shakin', kid, screamin'
He slapped my girl, that's the reason why I was f'in to lean 'im
Everything got real slow, I ain't hear shit, my word
At least forty seconds, I stay dead stiff
I pound him with the gun out, Big Din came, opened my hand
Removed the gun and the sixteen spun out
He floored past ninety on the BQE
I threw up all on his door, splashed his Gucci seats
I couldn't speak, I'm in a state of shock
About now there should be yellow tape on the block, a raid at my spot
Hey, yo, I feel a li'l bugged out, insane, I lost my mind
People tellin' me, Ghost, you actin' mad strange
I walk around acting strange
  (See what I'm sayin'? I don't know, I just don't feel right, G, no)
  (Havin' flashbacks)
Like a man in a daze
  (Bugged out, man, knah mean?)
  (Nah, I don't wanna go, I don't want the clinic, man)
People talking to me and calling my name
  (I don't want the hospital, son)
  (You know, I just feel like I'm lost, reality, man)
No, I don't hear a word they say
  (Y'knahmean? My face feels numb, son, I don't know)
Flashbacks to me blowin' his brains out
All I remember my shirt, I couldn't get them goddamned stains out
Oxy cleans wheat 'round the chest area
Right hand side, I'm pluckin' off li'l pieces of meat
And my goons want me to bounce to Tennessee
But I said no, I got these two snow-bunnies in Venice Beach
On the low, son, I sleep with the hawk, in East New York
'Round my man Killa' way where all the murderers walk
Manhunt, police searches, S.W.A.T ran in my crib
Battering rams, early mornin', yo, waking my kids
Now my aunt gotta stay wit' my wiz
She paranoid, havin' anxiety attacks 'cause of these pigs
Plus my connect, they goin' crazy, they try'na slay me
I told 'em, Friday I'll have they money, faggots try'na play me
I'll never eat up out a garbage can
I'll Larry Davis a cop, and if I make it alive, it was the Father's plan
I ain't goin' nowhere, I ain't goin' nowwhere, I'm aight, I'm aight
  (I walk around acting strange)
But I know one thing, if anybody touch me, I'm blowin' they head smooth off
  (Like a man in a daze)
Cops, connects, I don't give a fuck
  (People talking to me)
You know I'm a eagle, feel the eagle
(And calling my name)
You don't feel like that, you gon' feel like bulldog
Y'knahmean?  I don't give a fuck
  (Hear no word they say)
Don't put me in no mental clinics, it ain't nothin', y'knahmean?
If I make it out alive, I make it out alive, if not, fuck it
  (I walk around acting strange)
Ay ay, yo, I can't take this shit no more, it's too hype
  (Like a man in a daze)
Nigga thinkin' I'm buggin' out, I ain't buggin', I ain't buggin'
Y'all niggaz'd be buggin' out too if you had somebody's flesh on you
  (People talking to me and calling my name)
Motherfuckers, fuck ya'll niggaz, I ain't goin' crazy
Sleepin' on couches and shit
  (No, I don't hear a word they say)
I'm goin' back outside, fuck ya'll niggaz, man
I know my mother, she's worried about me
'Cause they might have to put me away any time
But when my baby packed up her clothes and left me
She sure, oh, I believe, I believe, she took my mind
Oh, she took my mind
