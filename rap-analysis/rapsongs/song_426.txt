(Chorus) 
Sit back, and let this thugshit, Clog Up Yo' Mind (x3) 
[Krayzie] 
Now, I'm ah nigga ta keep ta myself, and don't fuck wit' nobody 
I'm quiet, I'm thuggin'. Why are y'all so fast? 
Ain't time ta take ta quicken put to derail my thugs 
Well I might be Krayzie, civilized, I cruize in my Mercedes 
as ah bye-bye, nigga feel tha Bone, now spray, hey 
especially foe tha police, man. I'm ah nigga wit' thugshit 
cause I'm runnin' wit' tha niggaz in tha hood and that's how we play 
Wanna feel ah my spray-pump hit yo' chest, and finally realize 
who you're fuck with, fuckin with them niggaz in Cleveland 
ya do whateva like he say 
Then flip again, in the Land, got tha upperhand 
cause I got tha gripping good delay 
If you niggaz can dash, wit' tha lethal mass 
and then pass wit' tha very blast 
It ain't innocent, you should never been there 
in tha first place, fall, you got yo' curse today, hah 
Willin' die-hard nigga, wanna give up fakin 
nut devotion just do what you want 
So bitch, Krayzie Bone, real it now, and when did they lose? 
You'll feel the vibe, nigga 
Killin cause I'm Krayzie, nigga, cause I got to get the money 
get the platinum fund to pay 
But I'm ah be ah thinkin bout my niggaz 
when I got ta do sum flippin', if ah nigga ain't got my back 
(Chorus) 
[Layzie] 
Foe tha love of tha money, I keep spenidin' yo 
Just sum pap low shit, gotta let 'em hang low 
Swangin' lead from my 44 magnum though 
Wit' ah nuttin' indo smoke, when my thugs be sure, sure 
Hope ya know, I rip heartz, it's on, jackin' move 
then ya betta figure again, and quit plottin 
Takin' over this everyday, stoppin' to tha tough 
Double Glock and it's not forgotten 
Bitchez drop in Tha Clair 
It's tha Bone Thugs, in this shit wit' Eazy E and we made it 
and ah nigga wanna hate me 'cause I'm famous 
I'd still leave 'em in tha streetz, you can't blame us (lady luv) 
cause when they catch me without my heat, and I'm thuggin 
in tha streetz and I'm rollin 
Thuggin by the deadliest G's, you can't fuck wit us 
to the pressure out of pressure, I'm loadin, blow you up 
Y'all know we don't worship sin, it's tha heartz of men 
and we'd tested stress, wanna be blessed consists of tha sin 
in tha wayz of tha sin, to be dead. (Chorus) 
[Bizzy] 
And then they promised, that all tha soulz would last 
til the dayz of tha livez of tomorrow 
and if you'd follow, tha end of the world 
should ah come ah so soon, it's so hard to swallow, I know 
I know, hey, how ta get down foe my thang 
get me a coffin, bangin my soul'z, gonna get-cha 
flossed' and out with a bang 
Welcome to Tha Land, where all my chemicalz unfold 
where thugs are rollin up on bone
and takin a hollow, dodging them bullets 
but no more and i let em rest 
well let me get silenced stressin 
Demon was screaming, i feed em but i can't please em 
and I got 'em and there, gotta learn their lesson 
Blastin', load my revolver,hand me bigger me pump, but never my dirty,
then i reached a peak of happy, so I give krayzie the face, 
last clasp and blastin  
set em off, For tha Bone, hit 'em up, and lesson up tha violence 
Screamin' on ah my murda mo and the thuggish ruggish, niggas gon-be dyin, hittin, and buckin them down to tha pave 
Cause I'm in tha new sense of me grave 
Couldn't you hataz, wouldn't be saved, hate 'em 
Hate ta shook, and put ah pen up in dem 
Foe tha love of money make em go crazy 
and Benjamin Franklin pleaze come save me, 
little eazy told me roll-me-up, then i was smarter than a villian fiend foe tha greenm see everybody sweatin 
foe tha g's, still in ah myst wit' tha clich 
an unpropable way of ah trial 'cause it's tha funk, sing 
(Chorus) 
[Wish] 
(Now give it to 'em) 
Ya, gotta sit back, smoke and choke, meditate, mental state 
wit' tha Bone, B-ONE. We steadily grieve on, givin' you what 
you need man, clone Bone, shock 'em, drop 'em, pop 'em 
let 'em know Bone in tha fukkin' war (no, no) 
you hataz make feellike, you wanna feel my motherfuckin 44 
But I gotta stay clean, it's cool, then unless he freein 
I'm mean sum cheeze, me and my niggaz, and this Mo' Thug, Mo' Thug 
cavalry, on tha streetz 
Ready ta ride, when it's time ta ride, ready ta kill 
when it's time ta kill, you gon' die, you' gon' die 
I've been tryin if you really wanna ride on down wit' Bone 
then come on, come on. If ya really wanna ride, get down 
but get stuff, but ya come on, come on 
(Chorus)
