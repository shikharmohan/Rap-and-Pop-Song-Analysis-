As I take another choken *** of icky sticky stanky
Stuff a bull, pack a ***, twist a ***, roll and light a ***
Lean back and puff slow
Whenever I'm makin' a record, I'm gettin' into my character
And I'm tryin' to portray somethin' that I'm feelin'
So that the whole world can believe in it
Do anybody know my name, what's my name? Snoop Dogg
What's my name? Snoop Dogg
Hold on, I want y'all to say my name like dis
Snoop, Snoop, Snoop, Snoop, Snoop
There are seven wonders in the world
You're about to witness the eighth
*** ask about me, *** ask about me
You don't believe me? *** say what?
Aiyyo Cat, roll out the blue carpet, cuzz
Lemme C-walk on these ***
Blue hat, blue socks, blue shoes, too cool
Blue car, blue house, blue pit, blue pool
Blue grass, blue Coupe, blue b-ball hoop
What kinda phone you on, loc? I'm on the blue too
Talkin' to my nephew, my *** Boo, half who?
He make pimpin' on a *** look so cool
Old school, old fools, steel on a *** first
Run up with that punk *** and I fill up a *** shirt
Do it to it hurt 'cause it hurt so bad
Snoopy D O dub, they can't touch yo' swag
Oh mark ***, better tuck yo' flag
'Cause when my music out loco, I come to smash yo' ***
*** him, *** her and *** all y'all too
He wants everything to be right 'cause I'm Snoop Dogg
I'm so hood, so true
And every time that you see me cuzz, I'm oh so blue
To get that you have to stay on top of your game
And learn the most specific lesson
That *** is dope right there, God
