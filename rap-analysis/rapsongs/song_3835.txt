Chorus: Mary J. Blige
I can love you, (I can love you), I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you, (I can love you), I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you better than she can . . .
I can love you, (I can love you), I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you, (I can love you), I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you better than she can . . .
 
[Blige]
Sitting here, wondering why you don't love me
the way that I love you and baby
Have no fear, cause I would never ever hurt you
and you know my love is real and I can . . .
Chorus
[Blige]	
I know sometimes can get rough, but we'll make it
We'll make it through the storm and I know
I will try to make sure that you can trust me
And you know the reason why that I say . . .
Bridge: Mary J. Blige
I can love you (I can love you) a little better than she can
I know that you (I know that you) wish that you could be my man
Cause I can love you better than she can
 
Chorus
 
[Lil' Kim]
If I told you once, I told you twice, Q-B
Through the boott, like a groupie for more ice
Armor truck heist, get the bone just like N'Bushe
In love with you since the days of Juicy
Now I watch you play Columbo, Picasso
Tricks inside colossals, turn you castles to brothels, uh!
Who you lovin?  Who you wanna be huggin?
Dippin on ya Ninja Honda with Tanisha and Rhonda, wha!
You work more body than Jane Fonda
Physical fitness, Mary Blige be my witness
Under pressure, I lie for ya, die for ya
Cougar by the side for ya, right hand high for ya
Because of you, I'm inheritin trillions
Buryin billions, Bentley Coupe millions
Playin good samaritan, in the Sheridan
Crack the Dom Pi's and Rim B's, you better hurry in
Who's gone love you like I do? Huh? Wha?
Who's gone treat you like I do? Huh? Wha?
Mary Blige, Lil' Kim, hah-hah
Queen Bees, ah-hah, that's me
That's right, Mary J, Lil K
 
[Blige]
Who's gonna make you feel the way I do?
Nobody, nobody
Who's gonna make you feel the way I do?
Nobody, nobody
