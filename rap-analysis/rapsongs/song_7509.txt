Hoo, yeah, haa
Hoo
She flew in like calm breeze
Tall brown skin her weave like palm trees, I went coconuts
Dipped my dunkin' between your donut
Don't want it if it ain't no slut, bitch
Fathership touch ground, like fly on soup
Don't invite me, I tear the fuck down
White ones cut my toupee
Father's ain't wrestler, or scream play
I slump it out thought slay, it ain't nuttin' to bust ass
Bullet him, get him fast
Bitch I don't break out, blast to the next rash
The dog piss on MC's like trees
Got meals but still grill that old good welfare cheese
Hoo, hey, eeh, haa, hoo
