The sweetest thing, I've ever known
Was like the kiss on the collarbone
Soft caress of happiness
The way you walk, your style of dress
I wish I didn't get so weak
Ooh baby, just to hear you speak
Makes me argue just to see
How much you're in love with me
See, like a queen, a queen upon her throne
It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I know
It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I know
I get mad when you walk away
(Don't walk away)
So I tell you leave, when I mean stay
Warm as the sun dipped in black
Fingertips on the small of my back
More valuable than all I own
Like your precious, precious
Precious, precious dark skin tone
It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I know
It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I know
It was the, ah, I tried to explain
Ah, but baby, it's in vain
Speaking on my mother's phone
The touch that makes me think I'm grown
(You ain't grown)
Sweet prince of the ghetto, your kisses taste like amaretto
Intoxicating, oh, so intoxicating
How sad, how sad that all things come to an end
But then again, I'm, I'm not alone
It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I know
It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I know
Ah, sometimes watch you in your sleep
Ah, excuse me if I get to deep
(Ha)
It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I know
It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I know
It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I know
It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I know
It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I know
It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I know
