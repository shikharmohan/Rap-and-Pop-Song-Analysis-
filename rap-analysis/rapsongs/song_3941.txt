Intro:
If you're girl only knew... (echo)
If you're girl only knew... (echo)
[Aaliyah]
If your girl only knew,
That you was trying to get with me (what would she do)
If your girl only knew,
That you was dissin' her to talk to me
She...
Chorus:
She would probably leave (probably leave) 
You alone (you alone)
She would probably curse you out and unplug her phone (heyyy)
I bet she'd be glad (oh yeah) 
That you was gone (you was gone)
And that she wouldn't have to worry (oohh)
No, no, no more
If your girl only knew,
That I would want to kick it with you (if she knew)
And if your girl could only see,
How you be calling me, getting fresh with me
She probably...
Chorus:
She would probably leave (leave you) 
You alone (you alone)
She would probably curse you out and unplug her phone (unplug her phone)
I bet she'd be glad (she'll be glad) 
That you was gone (that you was gone)
And that she wouldn't have to worry (oohh)
[Lil' Kim]
Uh, you wanna know what she'd do?
[Lil' Kim]
Uh, if she caught you, probably drop you
Call me the L-I-L K-I-M
The number one, never two
If I was her, I'd take you for your stash
Brand new B.M., get you for your cash
And Aaliyah don't want you, for her songs
You wanna catch me
Queen Bee might be made, but you can't get me
Messin' wit' chickenheads, slidin' on ice
Sex is an option, if the price is right
Thourough sistas, we adapt to any rebel sistas
Whole bank figures, just like Aaliyah
I'm one in a million, plus I sell that much
Remember Jr. Mafia, I need you tonight, get your only dutch
Remix, Aaliyah and Lil' Kim, uh
Bridge:
She's crazy to put up with you (hey)
Oh boy I won't be no fool (won't be no fool)
Let you like what you see 
It ain't easy to get with me (no baby)
If ain't gon' put up with you (with you...)
I won't be no fool (won't be no fool)
Let you like what you see
It ain't easy to get with me
Chorus 3x
[Lil' Kim]
Oh, ho, whoa, whoa
Hey yea, yeah
Oh ho
