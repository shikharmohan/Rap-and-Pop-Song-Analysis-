Yes, yeah, it's chief rocker, Busy Bee
Y'all don't know what time it is right now
I got my main man Marley Marl
My motherfuckin' main man, KRS-One the teacher
We gettin' ready to do a little history in here
Y'all don't know what time it is
History is in the makin', work it out
Where's that place we work it out?
Hey, the House of Hits, we work it out
Where's that place we work it out?
Hey, the House of Hits, we work it out
I said, "Where's that place we work it out?"
Hey, the House of Hits, we work it out
Where's that place we work it out?
Hey, the House of Hits, we work it out
And when it's time to work it out
We take 'em straight down to the house
And blow some, that jingle-jang, jingle
Yeah, chief rocker, Busy Bee
Check my lingo, check what Busy Bee brings you
Check out the lyrics I sing you
I fly through the hood like chicken wings do
Like a chef Marley likes mixin' things too
We came together just to change the weather
Busy Bee, he made this game remember?
These unoriginal rap flows, I don't speak those
Too many rappers just copy like Kinko's
Dressin' like they from office depot
Tryin' to be CEO's with whack weak flows
I teach those that flow how to be better
I train MC's to gain in any endeavor
But if you tryin' to diss, you'll get dismissed from the class
In other words, I'm kickin' yo' ass
Beats, bars and breaks, really that's it
And you get that sound at the House of Hits
Where's that place we work it out?
Hey, the House of Hits, we work it out
Where's that place we work it out?
Hey, the House of Hits, we work it out
I said, "Where's that place we work it out?"
Hey, the House of Hits, we work it out
Where's that place we work it out?
Hey, the House of Hits, we work it out
And when it's time to work it out
We take 'em straight down to the house
And blow some, that jingle-jang, jingle
Yo, look, look
KRS reportin' from the House of Hits kids
'Cause in the future you gonna doubt it existed
Comin' up the block your whole spirit gets lifted
The whole spot designed for the lyrically gifted
You walk in the spot, you walk in the history
This is where the greatest MC's spit it lyrically
I don't think you hearin' me today
Big Daddy Kane, Rakim, LL Cool J
Kool G. Rap, Roxanne Shante
Craig G, man, what else can I say?
The home of hits, where one spits and records
In the other room we live on the broadcast boards
The internet's hooked up with all these cords
And the outboard gear man you can't afford
You can rest assured we comin' out with it
KRS, Busy Bee at the House of Hits
Where's that place we work it out?
Hey, the House of Hits, we work it out
I said, "Where's that place we work it out?"
Hey, the House of Hits, we work it out
I said, "Where's that place we work it out?"
Hey, the House of Hits, we work it out
Where's that place we work it out?
Hey, the House of Hits, we work it out
And when it's time to work it out
We take 'em straight down to the house
And blow some, that jingle-jang, jingle
And ba bah-ba bah-ba-da-dang-a-dang-diggy-diggy
Ba bah-ba bah-baba-da-dang-a-dang-diggy-diggy
Ba bah-ba bah-baba-da-dang-a-dang-diggy-diggy
Ba bah-ba bah-baba-da-dang-a-dang-diggy-diggy
Ba bah-ba bah-baba-da-dang
