This is, this is, this is, this is
We are not the same, I am a martian
We are not the same, I am a martian

We are not the same, I am a martian
And I'm hotter than summer rain like Carl Thomas
Lock, load, ready to aim at any target
I can get your brains for a bargain
Like I bought it from Target, hip-hop is my supermarket
Shoppin' cart full of fake hip-hop artists
I'm starvin', soarin', I gotta eat early
And I be back in the mornin'

We are not the same, I am a alien
Like Gonzalez, young college student
Who done just flipped the game like Houston
I'm used to Promethazine and 2 cups, I'm screwed-up
And you ain't shit, if you ain't never been screwed-up
Flow so sick, make you wanna throw your food up
Ice-water chest, and my wrist like a cool cup
2 twin-clippers, I give your ass a crew cut
I get brain like cold cuts, you know what?
Your girl go down fast, come up slow, but I never slow up
Weezy

They don't make 'em like me no more
Matter fact, they never made it like me before
I'm rare like Mr. Clean with hair
No brake lights on my car rear
I never had lice and I never had fear
I rap like I done died and gone to Heaven, I swear
And yeah, I'm a bear, like black and white hair, so I'm polar
And they can't get on my system, 'cause my system is the solar
I am so far from the othars, I mean others
I done eat them for supper get in my spaceship and hover
