Intro: Raekwon the Chef
It's the remix Son
Can it be, act like you know
Check it
Verse One: Ghostface Killer
Yo, check what happened out of state
I'm knocking off a half-a-cake Cash Rule, flying at a fast rate
I smoke the black dust kept my hands clutched, I'm fallin in lust
Spore plush I played my hand like a royal flush
Baggy jeans, Wallabee Clarks, pretty woman
I put it in him, shot up in him, deadly venom
I hung around the big time bosses
Illegal force exchange thoughts, showing love to all my sources
Spades tried to bag me, like Cagney, and Lacey
Chef had that bitch Stacey slippin in Macy's
I dose off, catch a flashback on how I got trapped
and got licked like Papsy in a mob flick I got hit 
Stumblin holdin my neck to the God's rest
Opened flesh burgundy blood colored my Guess
Emergency trauma, black teen headed for surgery
Can it be an out of state nigga tried to murder me?
I should've stayed in Job Corp, but now I'm a outlaw
Ray Cartegna, carry a fo'-fo' nigga
Chorus:
{Can it be that it was all so simple then?}
Dedicated to the Gods and Earths
Dedicated to babies who came feet first
Dedicated to Up North and down state
Dedicated to rich niggaz who sell weights
Dedicated to projects with black kids
Dedicated to man who build pyramids
  Word up! What the fuck yo?
We taking you on another chamber
Word up son, you know how we be on it
Yeah it's real
  Show these crabs how to rhyme man
I think it's time to bless them, word up
  Bulletproof
First chamber
  Yo Chef yo
Verse Two: Raekwon
It started off on the Island, AK Shaolin niggaz wildin
Old folks scream : stop the violence!
True layin up yo, watchin these crack niggaz
Playin nuff crap games for what see?
Back in days, crime pays in mad ways
Sportin Tommy Hil with caves 360 waves 
And no searchin for loose ends, now flex 300 Benz
Mad 10's with mad diamonds
Now that's the life of the good life, sometimes niggaz act trife
I paid the price throughout my hood life
Remember I got blasted, now that's in the past kid
God forbid I lay in the casket
But now I'm all about G-notes, no time for weed, mixed with coke 
I wash my mouth out with soap
And I got my act together, 'Lo sweaters and better
and fat leather, so whatever, bring it on
{Can it be that it was all so simple then?}
Outro:
Yeah, for real
Murderous material stacked up
Peace to mazes, for real
Meditating on life
Gold, word up y'all
Crazy fly, dedication, to my people
Word up, peace to all my brothers that I ain't gonna see no more
Peace to brothers on the Island, up North
Word up
  Straight up, I love you boy, it's on like that
Word up, word up
Peace to man woman and child
Word up
  I got you covered baby, I'm here for you
Project, check it
Projects peoples one love
Keep your head clear, we out of here
  We move in silence
Bad boys, creating, the muderous stacks for your headpiece
Baldheads, braids, blowouts
Yo
  Fly chicks
It's the remix y'all
For real, the real side
  The RZA, check it
Razor blade sharp
Peace to the Clan
  No other producer can compare boy
WORD UP
