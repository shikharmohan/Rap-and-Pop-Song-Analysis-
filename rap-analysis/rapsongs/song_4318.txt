[Intro:]
Damn ..
I cant believe she left me like this 
I mean I brought her to the airport but
I cant believe she jumped on the plane
and left me like this 
And I would leave
[Verse 1:]
but I had to take a minute in the smoking section 
Trying to let the pain ease 
Watching her plane leave 
Tripping in the smoking section 
Trying regain me 
How can I get a grip
when I lost my main squeeze ..
and now I'm stuck
inside of an ashtray 
Like a cigarette, but
my heart pumps gasoline 
And this she know 
I just crashed and burned 
Now here come the smoke 
(yeah)
[Chorus: Juliany]
Find me where u left me
burning in the smoking section 
Up in smoke
Whats left you'll find it in the smoking section 
Find me where u left me
burning in the smoking section 
Up in smoke 
Whats left you'll find it in the smoking section 
[Verse 2: Juliany]
I gave myself a hour to sit at the gate 
I booked us yesterday flight 378 
U think I gave him enough time
to change my mind 
I love him but
I couldn't this time 
I packed it all up
in my two bags
and one carry on 
U would think I was sure
but it feels so wrong 
(?)
I guess I'll smoke my last
stuck wondering what i should do 
[Chorus: Juliany]
Find me where u left me
burning in the smoking section 
Up in smoke
Whats left you'll find it
in the smoking section 
Find me where u left me
burning in the smoking section 
Up in smoke 
Whats left you'll find it
in the smoking section 
[Verse 3:]
(yo) I'm like hold up whats up 
Shorty what u going for ?
She packed up, dipped out 
Now she left me all alone 
Back up in the smoking session 
Damn she got me really tripping 
Weezy tell me what u sipping 
I fucked up on this situation 
Please pass me a cigarette 
My nerves back, calm down 
She always used to promise
if she leave she'll be back around 
I guess it's some things
as a man that I'm missing 
So at the end of the night
u can find me in the smoking section 
(yeah)
[Chorus: Juliany] (2x)
Find me where u left me
burning in the smoking section 
Up in smoke
Whats left you'll find it
in the smoking section 
Find me where u left me
burning in the smoking section 
Up in smoke 
Whats left you'll find it
in the smoking section
