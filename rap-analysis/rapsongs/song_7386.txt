(Chorus) 
Pimpin' hoes slammin' Cadillac doors 
Shawty understand this is how we roll 
Parkin lot pimpin' on fo's 
VA to H Town yeah you already know 
Choppin' on blades so amazing 
Look at them boys teeth thats crazy 
The lean in the weed got us lazy 
Yellow boppers is boppin' but you already know 
Straight out the south with my nuts in my hand 
Its the Swisha House the Third Coast the state of Texas thats my land 
Whos the man thats in demand 
Its Paul Wall baby yeah thats me 
I put it down on that gulf bank but now i reside on that south beach 
And im hustlin on the grind 72 
Hours straight 
No time to eat or sleep im slangin' licks and that just won't wait 
Im campaignin for a new Benz 
On the rims with bubble lenz 
Im stackin' every dollar i see 100s 50s 20s and 10s 
Doors open doors close never sweat hoes playas get yo's 
Hustle and flow cars clothes thats the playa like that i know 
Roll the dank up where the dro? 
Pour the drank up where the fo's 
Stackin money all on the low and we still ridin dirty 
(Chorus) 
Got a drop top on them rollerskates 
Candy jolly rancher paint 
Enjoyin the spoils of hard work and grind more tryin to get bank 
I dont know what them boys thinkin my motivation is benjamin franklin 
Im tryin to maintain this wealth that i been calculatin 
Gettin money thats all i know 
On my toes never off my note 
Woodgrain and hundred spokes i wave the trunk just like a pro 
I grind its off to work i go I hustle hard its no stop 
And if i flop i switch to hustle 
I learned the game then set up shop 
Im strivin' to make it to the top 
Its all or nothin no turnin back 
Im with them boys out on the block 
Accumulating them paper stacks 
Im makin money this where its at 
Whatever it takes crack or jack 
In love with my money and thats a fact 
And we STILL RIDIN' DIRTY 
(Chorus) 
(Paul Wall Talking) 
Right now we got the 5th wheel reclinin 
Trunk popped up screens fallin from the sky 
Candy paint sprayed by eddie and im ridin on that glassy chrome 
all courtesy of my hustle game 
Real hustlin's in my blood line 
I dont complain or whine 
I just get on my grind puttin in work overtime 
I learned over time any hustle or any grind whatever it takes to make a dime I keep that paper on my mind 
I was born blind but now i see that road to riches 
Its a long road full of hurdles potholes and ditches 
Norv Freeman taught me keep it movin when you take a loss 
And Chad Butler taught me keep it trill at all costs 
I peep game from the best and since then i been playin chess 
I put in work with no rest 
To get that paper thats my quest 
Im on the slow grind towards success 
One of the best 'cause i keep it fresh 
Im one hundred isnt nothin less 
And im STILL RIDIN' DIRTY 
(Chorus)
