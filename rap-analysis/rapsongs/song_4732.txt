You should be happy if we get outta this thing wit a ringtone
clown
That was cool now let's get back to that block shit
Make it impossible for haters who wanna pop shit (I got this)
I'm leanin back in the cockpit
I drop big bombs these bastards can't stop it (Hotness)
I'm a profit for profit
Once I decide to lock it
Frontin on me is toxic
Go prop on haters love songs and rock hits
Blow em out the ?trunk? is what I spit they aint about ish (This is it)
I'm so ruthless and cunning when the drummer was drumming
Ya'll see I got your man running
LL the boss
Like luke wit the force
My techniques ugly
Dirty like rugby
Drop jewels like yoda my young students love me
All rappers are under not one of them above me (I rip it)
I blow the whole house down
On your big mouth clown
You can come see me now
(chorus)
Mic check
You are now Rocking wit the G.O.A.T.
Throw your hands in the air have a sip take a toke (Hot ish)
You are now Rocking wit the G.O.A.T.
Go 'head do your two step wit your hand in your coat playa
You are now Rocking wit the G.O.A.T.
Throw your hands in the air try to wave away the smoke (That's it)
You are now Rocking wit the G.O.A.T.
Go 'head do your two step while I let these haters know
(You better back down)
Listen good with both ears
Keep your mouth shut, fall back like broke chairs
How can they deliver like me I'm so rare
Your man had a pretty good run I don't care(So far)
So far ahead that I'm countin in light years
That mean lightning strikes longer than your career
I'm so arrogant superstars you like that, yeah
In your Club making rukus no momma wanna touch us (I'm a grown man)
?Muff? boys like Kobe at the Ruckers
Play Chris Tucker, Rush all you cocksukers
You way to lame
I showed you game
Just in case Ya'll forgot my name
I'm the G.O.A.T.
Much hottest lately
Ripping all comers since Cut-Creater tried to break beat
Farmers Blvd's is up in here thick
And I help Russell hustle you could go ask Rick

They probably put a hit on me for murdering the track
They tried to flip on me they thought I wasn't coming back
They sealed the jar 'n then they threw me in the back
Career means circles I came (back like) bbrrraaaackkkk

And you could've rocked wit me but your not real
So when I polish off the plaque I'll let you know how it feels
