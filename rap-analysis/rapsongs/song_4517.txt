This is [x4]
We are not the same I am a Martian (MartianÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦)
We are not the same I am a Martian (MartianÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦)
Greetings from Planet Weezy
We will begin transmission
In 5, 4-4-4, 3, 2, 1
[Chorus:]
Home Phone (Weezy)
Home Phone (Weezy)
Home Phone (Weezy)
Home Phone (Weezy)
And if you feel like you're the best
Go ahead and do the Weezy-we and
Home Phone (Weezy)
Home Phone (Weezy)
[Verse 1:]
We are not the same
I am a Martian
And I'm hotter than summer rain like Carl Thomas
Lock, load ready to aim at any target
I could get your brains for a bargain
Like I bought it from Target
Hip-hop is my supermarket
Shopping cart full of fake hip-hop artists
I'm starvin' Sorry
I gotta eat all it
And I be back in the morning.
[Chorus:]
Home Phone (Weezy)
Home Phone (Weezy)
Home Phone (Weezy)
Home Phone (Weezy)
And if you feel like you're the best
Go ahead and do the Weezy-we and
Home Phone (Weezy)
Home Phone (Weezy)
[Verse 2:]
We are not the same
I am a alien
Like Gonzales
Young college student
Who wouldn't just flip the game like Houston
I'm used to Promethazine
In 2 cups I'm screwed up
And you ain't Shit 
If you ain't never been screwed up
Flow so sick 
Make you wanna throw your food up
Ice for the chest
And my wrist like a crew cup
2 twig clippers
I'll give your hair some crew cuts
I get bread like cold cuts.
You know what?
Your girl go down fast
Come up slow
But I never slow up
Weezy.
[Chorus:]
Home Phone (Weezy)
Home Phone (Weezy)
Home Phone (Weezy)
Home Phone (Weezy)
And if you feel like you're the best
Go ahead and do the Weezy-we and
Home Phone (Weezy)
Home Phone (Weezy)
[Verse 3:]
They don't make them like me no more
Matter fact they never made it like me before
I'm rare like Mr. Clean with hair
No break lights on my car rear
I never had life
And I never had fear
I rap like I done died and gone to heaven
I swear
And yeah I'm a bear
Like black and white hair
So I'm polar 
And they can't get on my system
ÃÂ¢€Ãcause my system is the solar
I am so far from the othars
I'm in Others
I'd eat them for supper
Get in my space ship and hover.
[Chorus:]
Home Phone (Weezy)
Home Phone (Weezy)
Home Phone (Weezy)
Home Phone (Weezy)
And if you feel like you're the best
Go ahead and do the Weezy-we and
Home Phone (Weezy)
Home Phone (Weezy)
