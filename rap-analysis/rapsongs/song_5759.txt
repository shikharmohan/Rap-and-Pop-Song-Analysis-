[mos def]
Here we go y'all
Ge ge ge ge ge get down, and get down
Ge ge ge ge ge get down, and get down and it's yours
Ge ge ge ge ge get down, and get down and it's yours
"here we go, there it is" (run-dmc sample)
Memories don't live like people
I have to pack up my bags and leave you
When you're gone I am longing to see
I'm a travellin man, movin through
I'm leaving, on a jet, when you're gone I get so upset
I'm a travellin man, movin through places
Packed my bags, arranged my suitcases
I got to tie up both my shoe laces
Kiss my cheek and see me gone
I'm leaving, but God willing I'll be back
I'm leaving, headed on the fast track
Aiyyo six in the morning, I'm up at dawn crackin
Wash up my face and start my back packin
Get my head together for the fantastic voyage
On a fastbreak like the georgetown hoyas
Kiss my baby bye, tell my honey don't cry
Wipe the tear from her eye, say so long then I fly
Then I'm off into limitless space wit swift pace
Left a few g's at the place just in case
Wit hace I get snappy, hit the corner hail a cabby
Brooklyn expressway, on the jfk
And wit no delay, so step on it dog-gonit
These fly outta-staters got the paper and I want it
The voice on percussion need no introduction
The mighty mos def on dj honda production
My jam keep you buzzin, like cash and good lovin
I'm stayin farm fresh, I ain't mos def for nuttin
So if you're in the groove let me see you move something
You're in the tri-state and you high stakes hunting
You wake up in the morn' sayin "must make something"
Well I got something special to make, let's motivate
Say memories don't live like people
I have to pack up my bags and leave you
When you're gone I am longing to see
I'm a travellin man, movin through places
I'm leaving, on a big jet
I got to hurry up and keep up in step
A travellin man, movin through places
Packed my bags, arranged my suitcases
I got to tie up both my shoelaces
Kiss my cheeks and see me gone
I'm leaving, but I won't be too long
I'm leaving, and I'll be good while I'm gone
I'm leaving *with variations*
But I'll be back again, but I'll be back again
I'm makin tracks again, step it up, my garmet bag on my back again
"here we go, there it is"
Yo it's the first class mission wit first class provision
The pray and hard work results is good livin
Let's hear it for the gettin, let's get all that we can
It's important and it's scorching so the fortune expand
Crossin borders of land, along the sands of time
I came to motivate the masses wit the standard of rhyme
You're understandin that I'm (so fresh)
They know it all across the planet that I'm (so fresh)
Mos def, takin both steps forward, these notes was recorded
The area's applauded, I feel so rewarded
By the grace of allah, you can shine like a star
The more you realize reality the better you are
But now I'm swayze, three minutes and change, you know the game
Gotta skate, plenty paper to make, here come the plane 'cause
Memories don't live like people, I have to pack up my bags and leave you
When you're gone I am longing to see
I'm a travellin man, movin through spaces
I'm leaving, on a big jet, when I'm gone you get so upset
I'm a travellin man, movin through places
Packed my bags, arranged my suitcases
I'm out to see some brand new faces
Kiss my cheeks and see me gone
I'm leaving, but I won't be too long
I'm leaving, so dry your eyes while I'm gone
I'm leaving *with variations*
But I'll be back again (5x until fade)
