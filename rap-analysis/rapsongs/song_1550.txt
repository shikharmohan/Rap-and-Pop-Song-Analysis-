Malcolm Garvey Huey, study Malcolm Garvey Huey,
Their life is like a movie,
Study Malcolm Garvey Huey, Malcolm Garvey Huey,
Malcolm Garvey Huey, their life is like a movie,
I live, I die, I organize,
Everything I do's revolutionize,
I build what's good for the whole damn hood,
Study G's like these, really think you should,
I study Malcolm Garvey Huey, Malcolm Garvey Huey,
(?) with a UZI, listening to Fela Kuti,
I'm a goon with the machete, especially if it's deadly,
Got the Santos for the Xe to protect me, so respect me,
This is heavy legendary, revolutionary,
My wifey she resurrect me when they thought they had me burried,
Took me out the cemetery, now it's family over Avery,
Cause it's always necessary to avoid the commissary,
I'mma live for you five, so I stopped getting high,
If you know, then you recognize, it's that Black and Brown pride,
This the power of the mind, RBG, Guard Divine,
You can see it through the lies if you can read between the lines,
I live, I die, I organize,
Everything I do - revolutionize,
I build what's good for the whole damn hood,
Study G's like these, really think you should,
I study Malcolm Garvey Huey, Malcolm Garvey Huey,
Malcolm Garvey Huey, Malcolm Garvey Huey,
Malcolm, Garvey, Huey, Bunchy, Bobby, Pac 'n Tookie,
Sitting by the door, so you can say I'm acting spooky,
Just like in the movie, son, you better pack it truely,
Niggas squish be acting fruity or be cracking like they tookie,
Rather smoke a doobie than be burning and alluding,
Bang bang, pig shooting, we should blame Rudy Julie,
Banging for the cameras, China White & nose candy,
Unless you're banging on the system, you're a gangsta wearing panties,
RBG my family from the Bronx to Miami,
Police cannot stand me packing y'all like a manny,
Call me Little Bobby Hutton, cause I'm first to push the button,
Rappers don't be saying nothing to the system, we say fuck 'em,
This is for Nahonda(?), (?), Mama Akuwa,
All the real OGs, I'm a soldier cause you told me study
Malcolm Garvey Huey, Malcolm Garvey Huey,
Malcolm Garvey Huey I'm reportin' in for duty,
Stic.-ie-ickie, yours truely, here for duty,
(?) , you know how we dropped the jury,
This is real not a movie, not Mickey Donald Goofy,
I'm a soldier, I avoid a bitch nigga like the cooties,
Screwface in a hoodie, fresh pair of khakis,
We can do this like we fam or go to war like the apaches,
For whatever I stay ready, I learned that in Talahassi,
Babatunde used to school me as a juvie skipping classes,
Never let the system use me, my duty is my passage,
Watch the homies in your army, they don't always show their badges,
Keep your family living healthy, teach your children 'bout their blackness,
Teach your family how to use the ratchet, this shit is classic,
Get your food closed in shelters, fuck the system pimp it backwards,
I ain't hating, I'm just saying if you wanna be a rapper study Malcolm Garvey Huey.
