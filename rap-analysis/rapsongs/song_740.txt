Seem all the fellas understand what it feel
'Cos it's a Nubian Jam and ever thing's real
Seem all the fellas understand what it feel
'Cos it's a Nubian Jam and ever thing's real
It's time to blow up the spot, anything you was in, you're through the roof
All the jams we done been through is proof
We blend truth, with mathematics doin' acrobatics over beats
The sound dramatic when it played in Landrover jeeps
I know my peeps is in the front of the stage
Smokin' blunts with the strokin' stunts, ready to set it
When the word is given, I know you heard how we was livin'
Never takin' no shit, just stayin' clever and makin' the hits
Shakin' the tits of the honeys when they jump
Makin' money's what we bump cos slumps is for chumps
And we pumps, worldwide, girls slide backstage
Lookin' for a free ride, legs divide at a young age
Lord Jamar is like Jesus, speakin' in parables
And to devil's is cemarable
To see this, but they ain't got no choice
No escapin' the penetration of the voice
Seem all the fellas understand what it feel
'Cos it's a Nubian Jam and ever thing's real
Seem all the fellas understand what it feel
'Cos it's a Nubian Jam and ever thing's real
Seem all the fellas understand what it feel
'Cos it's a Nubian Jam and ever thing's real
Seem all the fellas understand what it feel
'Cos it's a Nubian Jam and ever thing's real
And I watched and I watched and I watched then I looked
The X is like no other who can drop it in the rain
I'm not that high, so give me back my lighter
Stage right in the party at night, I'm in the shadows
Thinkin' bout returnin' to the spotlight
The X is top flight, ESPN highlight
From, throughout the rhythm, I give em what I give em
Oil slickness on that ass like Ewin
I know what I'm doin', leave your whole town ruined
Brand Nubian, the name alone stands
Overseas fans be shoutin' different accents
So hence the black prince from 2-0
Soft-spoken but my words comprehended by the herds
Goin' back to the days past the ol' gun phase
All stare in amaze or get caught with the rays
Cos the X is like the master of the phrase
Seem all the fellas understand what it feel
'Cos it's a Nubian Jam and ever thing's real
Seem all the fellas understand what it feel
'Cos it's a Nubian Jam and ever thing's real
I want the mic in the clutch
'Cos it's too cold to hold, and too hot to touch
I'm like the thoroughbred searchin' for cheese
You can't cut off the head of a fatal disease
MC's freeze at thirty-two degrees below
Justice served, now watch us bust this herd
in the head with another jam set by the brother man
Letters for the other man, understand
Seem all the fellas understand what it feel
'Cos it's a Nubian Jam and ever thing's real
Seem all the fellas understand what it feel
'Cos it's a Nubian Jam and ever thing's real
Seem all the fellas understand what it feel
'Cos it's a Nubian Jam and ever thing's real
Seem all the fellas understand what it feel
'Cos it's a Nubian Jam and ever thing's real
Oh so real, so real, real, understand
So real, so real, so real, so real
So real, so real, so real, so real
Understand what you feel, understand what you feel
Nubian, Nubian, Nubian
