Gangsta, slow that shit down
Yeah, who wanna ride with this?
We can ride all day, every day
It's do or die all day, every day
It's suicide all day, every day
You'll be high all day, every day
I'm rolling down the avenue
Doing what I gotta do
Sick as the swine flu
Ain't nothing fine as you
Must I remind you
What is behind you?
Drop it down, took the ground
Like you was designed to
You can do it, lil mama, you can do it
(You can do it)
You can do it, lil mama, you can do it
(You can do it)
You can do it, lil mama, you can do it
(Slow it down)
You can do it, lil mama, you can do it
(And all that)
We can do it all day, every day
Get into it all day, every day
Drinking fluids all day, every day
I pursue it all day, every day
You can have it, just reach out and grab it
(Reach out and grab it)
You can have it, just reach out and grab it
(Reach out and grab it)
Just be careful, don't be a silly rabbit
(Silly rabbit)
Recreation use will turn into a habit
(Cut the shit)
To the ground, take it to the ground, girl
  (Cut the shit)
To the ground, take it to the ground, girl
  (Cut the shit)
To the ground, take it to the ground, girl
  (Cut the shit)
To the ground, take it to the ground, girl
  (Cut the shit)
Fuck the feds all day, every day
(Yeah, yeah)
And chicken heads all day, every day
(Yeah, yeah)
Get your bread all day, every day
(Okay)
Use your head all day, every day
Come on
You can do it, lil mama, you can do it
(You can do it)
You can do it, lil mama, you can do it
(You can do it)
You can do it, lil mama, you can do it
You can do it, lil mama, you can do it
(Drop that shit)
All day, every day
(Certified)
All day, every day
(Qualified)
All day, every day
(West Coast warlord)
All day, every day
Roll that, I blase that
Nigga, fuck way back
I does that, I does that
Homie, what was that?
I had to keep it plain and simple
Gangsters don't dance, we boogie
Four fingers up, two twisting in the middle
What's worst, ya all?
