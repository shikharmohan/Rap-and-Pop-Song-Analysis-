War
Our government is fucked
Sure to bring us down
The media incites civil unrest
Hatred could bring you down
War, I don't want your war
War, we don't need your war
We don't need your war, war
Military feasts starvin' countries
Drama brings you to your knees
Spill your blood to save humanity
Dyin' for the food we feed
War, I don't want your war
War, we don't need your war
We don't need your war, war
Our government is fucked
Sure to bring us down
The media incites civil unrest
Hatred could bring you down
Injustice drives you crazy
It drove L.A. insane
In this generation
Hatred is the name
War, I don't want your war
War, we don't need your war
We don't need your war, war, war
L.A. '92
Bastard magic should make you cry
The answer to the question is we ain't gonna die
L.A. '92
Police can make me under stress
While all L.A.'s a fuckin' mess
Don't patronize my fuckin' ass
Some heads will get crashed
L.A. '92
Bush has got his upper cut
He's goin' to fuckin' war
He won't revert to sticks and stones
Just bullet holes and broken bones
Chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos
Don't give a fuck
Everybody knock you down
No weight support, so taken down
The juk-jock might lock you in a cell
We ain't got a shit, now had enough
Chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos
Don't give a fuck
Disorder, disorder, disorder, disorder
Disorder, disorder, disorder, disorder
