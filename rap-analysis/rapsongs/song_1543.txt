Fear through time is left behind
When we simply havin' a wonderful time, a beautiful time
Leave the troubles you find at home
Take some time and ease your mind
When we simply havin' a wonderful time, a beautiful time
Leave the troubles you find at home
Hey, yo last day of spring first day of the heat
I'm calling out my troops, so y'all best retreat
Tryin' to win the eyes off of Little Bo Peep
While I'm pushin' Big Bird up Seaseme Street
After one nut I'm goin' straight to sleep
If it ain't a love affair, it's just a late night creep
Use Colgate when I'm brushing my teeth
Favorite MC's Gregg Nice and Smooth B
Keep it old school like where's the beef?
And if you ain't from an era then you up shit's creek
First B-side is freedom of speak
If you don't speak, well I ain't losin' no sleep
See me on the cover of your Double X-L
Takin' a holiday at the hotel
Fans keep sending me back the fan mail
Heavyweights keep it on th grand scale, when we doin' it
Fear through time is left behind
When we simply havin' a wonderful time, a beautiful time
Leave the troubles you find at home
Take some time and ease your mind
When we simply havin' a wonderful time, a beautiful time
Leave the troubles you find at home
Hey, yo, the sky swallowed the sun
Spitted out the moon and stars
Puttin' out shiners that gave the cause
Armor all ed down, the downtown activity
I'm 'bout to have fun without the problems that live with me
Not tryin' to be posh but let's stay out the mosh pit
Tonight keep my nose out of trouble
Everybody in my bubble's been briefed
No beef, just party
Of course your gonna have some clown
Niggaz try to take us off course
Always lower levels tryin' to bring out the devil in us
Not condoned but it's known that a party ain't a party
If the thugs don't try to shut it down
Tight security and its still soft
Can't offset the thirty or plus caught in the rush
Keep the door sealed 'cause the floor's filled with action
And we don't need any distractions tonight y'all
Introduce me to your madam, Mauzel
I'm Tarzan and she's my gazelle
I live at Biggs and say it's notorious
Travel through minds, emotions and euphorias
Glorious as I get great, still kinda smooth
Like way back in my old school tapes
I bring it pronto, rep the BX like Billy Blanco
Treat your troubles like colds, sweat it out, get it out
So we can get in the right mode, let it out
No need to pull on the throttle, if I could bottle this love
I wouldn't hesitate, get it straight
Wonder why I can medicate the soul
While takin' its toll, just for simply havin'
The right record  that could bring in the pull
And this must be the right run y'all
'Cause the dance floor's full 'cuz
Fear through time is left behind
When we simply havin' a wonderful time, a beautiful time
Leave the troubles you find at home
Take some time and ease your mind
When we simply havin' a wonderful time, a beautiful time
Leave the troubles you find at home
Fear through time is left behind
When we simply havin' a wonderful time, a beautiful time
Leave the troubles you find at home
Take some time and ease your mind
When we simply havin' a wonderful time, a beautiful time
Leave the troubles you find at home
