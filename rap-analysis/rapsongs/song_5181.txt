You and I, 'til the day we die
Yo, yo, ex-girlfriend, how you been?
I see you still tryin' to fuck with up a women, men
Remember when I first met you in my cousin's house
A week later we was fuckin' on your momma couch
Now it's been said that big girls they don't cry
But they damn sure lie, look you in the eye
Sayin' you they only you and I, 'til the day we die
Said you'd never leave me lonely, fly tenderoni but you phony
Shoulda listened, when my momma told me
Soon as I turn my back you try to fuck my homies
That was then, this is now I got a new friend
Ever since I cut them loose ends you wanna bone me
Add strife to my life, pussy, that'll make me think twice
About leavin' the wife even, picture that, you ain't want me
When you had me, now you on your third, baby, daddy
And you hate to see a nigga happy
So you tryin' mad ways to trap me, lookin' at my girl nasty
Tryin' to throw the pussy at me
Now look at this bitch over here tryin' to act like me
I'm gonna fuck that bitch, she what wifey leftover
I'm still lovin' you, babe, I'm still lovin' you, babe
I'm still lovin' you, babe, I'm still lovin' you, babe
I'm still lovin' you, babe, I'm still lovin' you, babe
I'm still lovin' you, babe, I'm still lovin' you, babe
Yo, yo, it's always you and your crusty ass crew, be actin' new
Let me find out that you fuckin' with Boo, and y'all gon' feel it
Waitin' for the day that you front, and catch a lump
From my black butterfly, that don't pack a lullaby
Sleep on her, she said, you bitches tried to creep on her
In the mall and didn't know she had the reach on her
Pearl-handled twenty-two, my Boo
She go ahead and walk her dogs, and represent Wu
To the fullest, you and hon can shoot the fair one
I'll bring the bullets, know what I'm sayin'?
Stop playin', you and them dyke lookin' bitches
Actin' like y'all jumpin' somethin', go 'head with that bullshit
I'm still lovin' you, babe, I'm still lovin' you, babe
I'm still lovin' you, babe, I'm still lovin' you, babe
I'm still lovin' you, babe, I'm still lovin' you, babe
I'm still lovin' you, babe, I'm still lovin' you, babe
Got tired of the games, the lies, the feeble alibis
Now you fuckin' with the next guy, a thug nigga
Derelict be actin' bugged nigga, show this nigga
Mad love but get no love nigga? Stupid ass
Plus I heard that he be beatin' on you, I seen him
At the club cheatin' on you, witcha best friend
Got you stressin' and used up, pull your shoes up
All you need's affection, but you're headed in the wrong direction
Tryin' to make this nigga jealous, with other fellas
All up in my face actin' overzealous
Like you want somethin' from Meth, I hope it ain't love, girl
'Cause I ain't got none left for you, plus you miserable
Misery love company, shit I'm livin' comfortably, don't need no
Nigga huntin' me down for fuckin' round, with his kitty
Talk to him, before my brother put a spark through him
Won't be pretty, the situation got my whole attitude shitty
And got you actin' high saditty with your slut committee
You know I know; so go find another sucker yo, I been there
And been done that before, and don't need it no more
That's my word, so go to your own with that there, word up
Tell that bighead, nigga, you run with that you was insane
I'm still lovin' you, babe, I'm still lovin' you, babe
I'm still lovin' you, babe, I'm still lovin' you, babe
I'm still lovin' you, babe, I'm still lovin' you, babe
I'm still lovin' you, babe, I'm still lovin' you, babe
