There she go sliding down the pole
There she go sliding down the pole
There she is, there she is, there she go, there she go
There she is, there she is, there she go, there she go
There she go sliding down the pole
There she go sliding down the pole
There she is, yeah, there she go
There she is, yeah, there she go
They say her brain is in her ass but she really smart
All about her cash never been a mark
Raised in the trap seen a whole lot
Glutinous maximums shape like a heart
Legs spread apart, trying to go to Clark
Looking for the light but always find dark
Some of my folks like trickin', some of my folks like pimpin'
Some of my folks spit rap, some of my folks pitch crack
Give you a tycoon shower without the shower cap
I got the money and the power sprinkle you a stack
There she go sliding down the pole
One dollar bills coming out her asshole
There she go sliding down the pole
There she go sliding down the pole
There she is, there she is, there she go, there she go
There she is, there she is, there she go, there she go
There she go sliding down the pole
There she go sliding down the pole
There she is, yeah, there she go
There she is, yeah, there she go
There she go down the pole
That's daddy's little girl but he don't know
If he finds out she'll be in trouble
But if he don't her money doubles
Everyday she goes to work
Put her on stage they go berserk
I'm way in the back blowing purp
You throwing cash in the air, you suppose to flirt
She come out dem draws ass everywhere
Don't keep her all night, pass her player
'Cause she's my favorite, yes, she is
I wanna see her dance naked, she the best in the biz
Bitch
There she go sliding down the pole
There she go sliding down the pole
There she is, there she is, there she go, there she go
There she is, there she is, there she go, there she go
There she go sliding down the pole
There she go sliding down the pole
There she is, yeah, there she go
There she is, yeah, there she go
Bigger than all outdoors, she got booty galore
Ass like I've never even seen before
She cakey, she pickin' up her money off the floor
It's crazy all the ballers in the club know
I called the crib told my broad, I ain't coming back home
I then found me another chick I wanna bone
They call me short, I'm nothing nice
Been hangin' out in clubs all my life
Seen a wild ass stripper, hair was bushy
Upside down with a bear in her pussy
Lay up on the pole she can sit on a roof
Slid back down she was getting it loose
There she go sliding down the pole
There she go sliding down the pole
There she is, there she is, there she go, there she go
There she is, there she is, there she go, there she go
There she go sliding down the pole
There she go sliding down the pole
There she is, yeah, there she go
There she is, yeah, there she go
