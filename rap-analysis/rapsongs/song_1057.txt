Yeah, this is for the people
This is street radio for unsung hero
Ridin' in the Regal, tryin' to stay legal
My daughter found Nemo, I found the new primo
Yeah, you know how we do, we do it for the people
And the struggle of the brothas and the folks
With lovers under dope, experiments to discover hopes
Scuffle for notes, the rougher I wrote, times was harder
Went from rock star to the voice of a martyr
Why white folk focus on dogs and yoga
While people on the low end try to ball and get over
Lyrics are like liquor for the fallen soldiers
From the bounce to the ounce, it's all our culture
Everyday, we hustlin', tryna get them custom rims
Law, we ain't trustin' them, thick broads, we lust in 'em
Sick and tired of bunchin' it, I look on the bus at 'em
When I see them struggling, I think how I'm touchin' 'em
Good days have come
  (It's about the people)
Now we are one
  (It's about the people)
Just take your time
  (It's about the people)
And then you'll find
  (It's about the people)
This is street radio for unsung hero
Ridin' in the Regal, tryin' to stay legal
My daughter found Nemo, I found the new primo
Yeah, you know how we do, we do it for the people
The people said that I was sharp on TV
At the Grammy's though, they tried to India.Arie me
Got back stage and I bumped into Stevie
He said, "No matter what, the people gon' see me"
Can't leave rap alone, the streets need me
Hunger in they eyes is what seem to feed me
Inside, peace mixed with beast seem to breed me
Nobody believe until I believe me
Now I'm on the rise, doin' business with my guys
Visions realize, music affected lives
A gift from the skies, to be recognize
I'm keeping my eyes on the people, that's the prize
Good days have come
  (It's about the people)
Now we are one
  (It's about the people)
Just take your time
  (It's about the people)
And then you'll find
  (It's about the people)
This is street radio for unsung hero
Ridin' in the Regal, tryin' to stay legal
My daughter found Nemo, I found the new primo
Yeah, you know how we do, we do it for the people
From Englewood to a single hood in Botswana
I see the I in We, my nigga, yours is my drama
Standin' in front of the judge with no honor
Barack stick, knight, the people like Obama
The karma of the streets is needs and takes
Sometimes, we find peace in beats and breaks
Put the bang in the back so the seats can shake
Rebel Cadillac music for the people sake, the people
Good days have come
  (It's about the people)
Now we are one
  (It's about the people)
Just take your time
  (It's about the people)
And then you'll find
  (It's about the people)
