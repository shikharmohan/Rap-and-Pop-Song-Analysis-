Yo baby, put your seatbelt on
I got my paperwork, don't worry
It's cool
Illegal search
(Do you wanna see it?)
(I'm gonna do it)
What the hell are you lookin' for?
Can't a young man make money anymore?
Wear my jewels and like freak it on the floor
Or is it my job to make sure I'm poor?
Can't my car look better than yours?
Keep a cigar in between my jaws
I drink champagne, to hell with Coors
Never sold coke in my life, I do tours
Get that flashlight out of my face
I'm not a dog, so damn it, put away the mace
I got cash and real attorneys on the case
You're just a joker perpetratin' a ace
You got time, you wanna give me a taste
I don't smoke cigarettes, so why you're lookin for base?
You might plant a gun, and hope I run a race
Eatin' in the mess hall, sayin' my grace
You tried to frame me but it won't work, illegal search
Keep on searchin'
I'm totally relaxed
Illegal searchin'
Illegal search
Keep on searchin'
Keep on searchin'
Keep on searchin'
Gotta, gotta, gotta
I call it nice, you call it a 'drug car'
I say 'disco', you call it a 'drug bar'
I say 'nice guy', you call me Mr. Good Bar
I made progress, you say, "Not that far"
I just started it, you're searchin my car
But all my paperwork is up to par
It's in my Uncle's name, so the frame won't work
Chump, illegal search
Keep on searchin'
Illegal search
You won't find nothin'
On the turnpike and everything's right
In the background is flashin lights
Get out the car in the middle of the night
It's freezin' cold and you're doin' it for spite
Slam me on the hood, yo, that ain't right
You pull out your gun if I'm puttin' up a fight
My car, my clothes, and my girl is hype
But you wanna replace my silver stripes
You're a real man, your uniform is tight
Fingerprint me, take me name and height
Hopin' it will but I know it won't work
Illegal search
(Do you wanna see it?)
Hey yo, Marley
Get funky
Illegal, illegal, illegal search
Real funky
(I'm gonna do it for ya)
(I'm gonna do it)
Keep it right there
Funk it up
I was sued to court, the case got thrown out
I'm that man that you all read about
Put me in jail, you're doin' it for clout
I only got one question: what's that all about?
Jail is somethin' that I can do without
Case dismissed and now you wanna pout
You feel like tryin' it again
But you know it won't work, illegal search
Keep on searchin'
Illegal search
But I got all my ID
And my car's registered
Illegal searchin'
Illegal search
And them cops out there
That did the wrong thing to one of my brothers
In Jersey, keep on searching
Youknowmsayin'? 'Cause that was foul
Peace
