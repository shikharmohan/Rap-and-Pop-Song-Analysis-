I.C.U., do you see me, I'm staring at cha'
I.C.U., do you see me, I'm staring at cha'
I.C.U., do you see me, I'm staring at cha'
I.C.U., do you see me, I'm staring at cha'
Before you got on, I could a hear a pin's drop
Maybe make me wanna clean out your clock
Go in your socks, confiscate your knot
Cool you off, because you think you're hot when you're not
Fools on the block will take your hand, brigettes and rocks
And your watch, can't wait until you come through
One more 'gain so they can empty your bins
Check your chin, don't try and be my friend
Get close and then attempt to do me in
Niggas know you'll spin, we can get on that Henn, eyes shut
Huh, can't touch, we don't care nothing 'bout you doing ten
Up in the pen, we ain't finna be mothering 'bout nobody
'Cause we motherfucking grown men
I.C.U., do you see me, I'm staring at cha'
I.C.U., do you see me, I'm staring at cha'
What's on your mind at this time, chilling fine, sip back on wine
Everything dope and scoping mine like it's yours
Opening doors to a future you can see
Really, Dungeon Family crew'll legendate
No catching guard presence in Southwest
And everybody who believe we the best and never gonna stop
Never gonna change, try to stay focused
Still running with the same crew since 82'
All I gotta do to [unverified] convince kids is say you'll all get big too?
I.C.U., do you see me, I'm staring at cha'
I.C.U., do you see me, I'm staring at cha'
How you doing Miss Thang, better yet should I say, Miss Queen?
I saw you in the corner and you was looking off
You're smelling classic baby, I'd like to hold it snug
Let's cut a rug and split this scene and strut up out this club
I be 'bout strictly business, I make it better
Get it better than the last dude where I hang, ain't no drama, momma
I reserved the bed behind the curtains
Keep it wet, keep you stuck, all up on the jewels
And keep you seeing colors like on the wall at MJQ
I.C.U., do you see me, I'm staring at cha'
Sugarpie, you wanna know how a nigga from the gutter ghetto
So butterfly, it's really on, and really I want is a moment alone
Baby please, it ain't your cheese, and [unverified] I'm interested
But that's on low-low, but I'd love and die 'til the morn'
Every word that I'd heard her say, it really inspired me
But I'm only staring 'cause I like what I see
But I know that you probably got a girl and already in love
Maybe next lifetime, you'll be free
I.C.U., do you see me, I'm staring at cha'
