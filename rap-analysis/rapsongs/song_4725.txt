I need a beat, I need a beat, I need a beat
If it's a Malibu beat, subject of discussion
Malibu beat, subject of discussion, you're motivated to aid a percussion
There's no glory for this story, it rock in any territory
I syncopate it and design it well, beat elevates, the scratch excels
All techniques are a combination of skills that I have, thought narration
Last year my melody, but still complete
Providing musical energy for the street
Lyrics are smooth for maximum effect
Jump track patterns on cassette
Time snare had bass and cymbal
Like that of a cat on the mic, I'm nimble
Basic patterns, grouped and changed
Sequence, frequent, seek and gain
Break, break for narration
Break two, break two
I'm in the center of a musical skinner
Some say the skins is a blow of torture
They hear me, they fear me, they hear me, they fear me
I'm improvin' the conditions of the rap industry
The beat will expand to land on foreign lands
Germany, Italy, France and Japan
It'll give you a lift, no need to sniff
No buts, no how's, no why's or if's
It's you I defeated, they'll say you retreated
Pick up your favorite magazine and read it
Wrapped by a power, a musical shower
A picture of me on the Eiffel Tower
I need a beat
Doing dirty, I'm your thought
You're bein' taken, the musical boom
I'm infiltrating your eardrums
Increasing the rate of vibration
I wanna rock ya, for you need to know
'I need a beat' is the title of the show
Providing pleasure on the musical measures
All arranged to alleviate pressure
I'm up on your list, your party therapist
Beat programmer and lyricist
Ladies Love Cool James, studio user
A million or more screamin', "People abuser"
I predict this jam will hit
The highest plateau in the world of music
Paparazzi, wealth and fame
The total propulsion of my name
I need a beat
Computer wise and the engineer's eyes
Have to be very acute, education level high
The product is mine, beat on the rhyme
The control was part of the studio design
Track after track, culminating on wax
The tape has slack, rewind then, back
Expensive but useful, the music is the fuel
A perfect place for MC's to duel
I need a beat, Farmer's Boulevard
Ha ha, Queens! Ladies Love Cool James!
