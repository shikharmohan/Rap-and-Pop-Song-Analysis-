There's no stoppin' what can't be stopped
No killin' what can't be killed
There's somethin' out there waitin' for us
There's somethin' out there waitin' for us
You can run but you can't hide from the Westside
Night stalker, shit talker, run and tell them it's the L M
Nigga with the gat and I'm back
Off the everyday prey that I slay
Rollin' with a fo' chase ya through South Central
Monkey-wrench ho should know that, she'll get the bozack
'Cause I'm not stavin', but fuck that Johnny Carson ho
Never had me on the Late Night Show
Comin' with the shit that'll hit
Steady mobbin' 'cause the flavor's good
There goes the neighborhood
Nigga with the third album, how come he don't fall off?
Rollin' with the sawed-off gauge
Turn the page of the chapter, caught up in the rapture
But you know Anita, she can get the pita
Eat 'em up yum and you're floored
Motherfuck Billboard and the editor, here comes The Predator
Yo, I'm out, but I'll be back
Yo, I'm out, but I'll be back
Yo, I'm out, but I'll be back
Yo, I'm out, but I'll be back
Check your head for the new style
Fuck Laurence Powell and Briseno, Wind and Koon, pretty soon
We'll fuck them like they fucked us and won't kiss 'em
Riots ain't nothin' but dodge for the system
Fightin' with the beast, no justice, no peace
If any, even if we fuck up Denny
Niggaz are sick of your white man tricks with no treat
That's right, now it's on, on sight
You call me a Muslim, no, I'm not a resident
Still got my vote in, Farrakhan for president
Of white America, I'm tearing ya a new asshole
Who's the nigga with the new black
Strollin' to your suburb house and I douse with gas
Now who's cleanin' up trash?
Eat 'em up yum and you're floored
Motherfuck Billboard and the editor, here comes The Predator
Yo, I'm out, but I'll be back
Yo, I'm out, but I'll be back
Yo, I'm out, but I'll be back
Yo, I'm out
Here comes The Predator
There's somethin' out there waitin' for us
Got my black rag showin' and I'm hoin', Ira Reiner
Can kiss my grits like Flo, on Mel's Diner
I'm meaner than a motherfuckin' hyena chasin' antelope
Put my chrome to your dome, watch it bust like a cantaloupe
I can't stand a rope, so don't try to hang 'em
Talk about dogs, boy I can slang 'em
Rat-a-tat-tat on your noggin'
'Cause Ice'll cream your ass like Haagen-Dasz
Chocolate, I get crazy when I catch wreck
Even be flippin' the tongue like da-diggity-dung, Das-EFX
So who is Ice Cube? I'm a rapper, actor, macker
Got a little problem with the redneck cracker, did the tallywacker
Jerry Heller is a devil shit packer
Comin' with a crazy pitch
And the Statue of Liberty ain't nothin' but a lazy bitch
Don't wanna give up the crack, to the black
But you'll call it racial, if we go and rape the ho
But eat 'em up yum and you're floored
Motherfuck Billboard and the editor, I am The Predator
Yo, I'm out, but I'll be back
Yo, I'm out, but I'll be back
Yo, I'm out, but I'll be back
Yo, I'm out
Yo, I'm out, but I'll be back
Yo, I'm out, but I'll be back
Yo, I'm out, but I'll be back
Yo, I'm out
They indicated, that when trapped, the creature activated
A self-destruct device, that destroyed, enough rain forest
To cover three hundred city blocks
