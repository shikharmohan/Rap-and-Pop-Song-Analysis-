Come on, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yo, yeah come on
Even if I died a thousand deaths
When I resurrect, I'll still be Meth the jams will still deaf
I'm here me and this micphone, we here
And ain't tryin' hear nothin' 'cause we had it up to here, word
Lyrics have no dress code from KRS to the Depeche Mode
Kid, I'm so cool you catch cold
At the jump of, it's about to jump off my niggas
Speak with they hands or their gun talk, yo, Rza
We got the clan in the front and police at the door
Every exit is laced with C-4
'Bout to blow like trial I'm passed out
MCs is like bitches in tongs, they ass out
But me the M E T H O D just too real
I can't be touched and can't feel the monotony of rap
Take a picture of my nutsack carbon copy that
And send your crew a fax mothafucka
New and improved Wu Tang style
Turn it up now y'all then fuck up now
Spit flame, five mics, peep game, on sight
Bring the pain all night, off the chain, damn right
This the Method Man for short Mr. Meth, Tical-Lion
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, come on
Even if I died a thousand deaths
When I resurrect through my first born
My name lives on, my words is like a third degree
The young MC's buzzworthy on your MTV
The Killa Bee, John Jacobs straight up break up schemes and plots
Ace up my sleeves bake up pies and pots
So this is what its come to, huh
Takin' shots at dem kids who used to punk you, huh
Repetitious rap shit don't get no airplay in my whip
And niggas can't smoke with dry lips
So chap byte my shit, I'm like Kojack
To get my flow back and 4-flat I track you down like a low jack
Five verse five, eye for an eye can I penalize
The uncivilized, make them civilized
You know right from wrong so know that I'm the bomb
I dope for be and see the tracks on my arm, mothafucka
New and improved Wu Tang style
Turn it up now y'all then fuck up now
Spit flame, five mics, peep game, on sight
Bring the pain all night, off the chain, damn right
This the Method Man for short Mr. Meth, Tical-Lion
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, come on
This is Method Man for short Mr.Meth, Tical-Lion
This is Method Man for short Mr.Meth, Tical-Lion
This is Method Man for short Mr.Meth, Tical-Lion
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, come on
