Hey C.S. man, umm
Yeah, since you don't wanna gimme a dollar for no beer, umm
Why don't you gimme a lyrical shout out on your album junior?
C'mon man, gimme somethin' man!
Common! Ah-heh!
Let's make a deal, pickle I'm pitchin' penny dimes and nickels
You couldn't sell a sticker, on the tape you're DJ tickles
I jiggle and juggle the rhymes like
I was to keep you suckers all waiting
My tub, I rub-a-dub it with my rubber duck I play
With those quack MC's, someone's been sittin' in my chair
And I'ma wash that crank right outta my hair
Shampoo but I'm down with the Nubian Nut, Joe and go for self
You're buggin' buddy doin' somebody nosin' don't know yourself
Peace to Sef and Jeff, Tae, "Deesy, dirty and Don Tanean?"
Haste makes waste
So with the case is how my day begins
Hot in quarter Vader shops the sports day market pelo
I'm think of my pap, the doctor slapped me in the hospital with a G-O
Word is bond when I was born and I took a breath
I never rhyme with busted rhymes and even the blind knew I was def
Respect to Chico, "Waller Al Kadee Roscoe Kalidjusome"
Poo-da, ba ba, Luther, the Baby B-Boyz always into some
Time for get me drunk, "Stu and more my cousin Adulay"
Fuck the bitches who dissed us and the hoes
Who wouldn't give rash a play
I'ma play and which way until I get my new props
Peace to Ricki love the rockin' shot to all the beer spots
The marks we used to stick up, the posse gets much thicker
To those who I forgot yo, I'ma blame it on the liquor
That's my nigga list to those who I missed
My ass, you can kiss, I gotta piss
