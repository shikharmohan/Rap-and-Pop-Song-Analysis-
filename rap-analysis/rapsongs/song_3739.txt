Open a de herb gate sellin pure ganja
babylon come but they undercova
they never really want me to stop sell ganja
(they just want to take a cut of what you make so far)
But Im not having it, I load the SLR
pack thje ganja BOOM they break down the door
ha-ha, 2 shots exchange at close range
out of 3 babylon, hit one in the brain
ha-ha, 2 shots hit the window pane
I exchange 4 shots, I drop and feel pain
but Im not hit, into the bathroom I crawl
I look out the window its a one storey fall
Im fallin, hit the ground and start crawlin
instead Im walkin round and blendin in wit the crowd
another day, I gotta way, I gotta fix this problem someday
but the very next day...
Chorus >repeat *2
Can stop wont stop sellin mad izm
all comeptition I gots to get wit em
me nah go jail and me nah go prison
(take it to his face kid dis em)
Im in another herb gate like a superstar
11:AM things are safe so far
I used to worry about the competition on the block
but now the competition on the block is the cops
and even blackwatch doesn't know where we lay
well..(open up its the D.E.A.)
ah man, just when I went for more led
The door opens up I've Got a glock to my forehead
wit nowhere to escape, I thought I was dead
but I woke up instead in a cell on my bed
I lay back down, then I heard a crack sound
2 D.T.'s came in and layed they glocks down
one was whistlin a love song, he put some gloves on
I thought to myself, damn somethings wrong
boom bap, boom bap against my head
I fell back on my bed, down to his feet
the pain was insane but the hit was sweet
'cause these dumb ass cops punched me right by the heat
the glock, 2 shots, 3 shots they screamin
then someone said..(ay wake up kid your dreamin)
I said what dreamin, that nightmare was hell
but as I look around, I was still in my cell
damn I got myself caught up in a jam
the D.T. that woke me up was like WHAT
I wiped the saliva off my mouth
then the D.T. said..(lets make a deal)
no doubt no question, now started up the session
no need for guessin, yes they want my supplier
I said, what makes you think theres anyone higher
he said..(dont be a god damned lier)
you killed 3 D.T.'s yesterday you heard me
but still the cops you knocked off, yea was dirty
now the whole investigation is federal
we want you to point out the rest of the cops that are criminal
he continued to say you cant think it thru
this whole drug game is bigger than you
follow our plan man and you'll be free
let me explain one thing so you can see
we....
Chorus
Now Im back in the herb gate all wired up
constantly thinkin about being tied up
snap out of it, Im thinkin damn we like l's
the federal and local cops got laws wit themselves
and Im in the middle and cant solve the riddle
my nose is runny {knock of door}..(let me get a 20)
a 20 of the green or a 20 of the brown
give me the whole brown clown or duck down {gunshots}
god damn, god damn, here we go again
but this time Im set up by my federal friends
suddenly I hear (yo move from the door) {gunshot}
followed by the shots sounded like the 4-4 {gunshot}
after the violence, then there was silence
then I heard (ah yo its us, open up the door)
but rule number one, in this game is self reliance
so I pickd up the mini Mac incase they wanted more
the door opened up, the feds said what up
they was stickin you up, so they had to get bucked
suddenly a sense of trust came over me
thought to myself.. .well soon I'll be free
but as I turned around I heard the gun go click
I said wait...but it was too late {gunshot}
