Now this is the tale of a murderer who comes from the Caucus Cliffs
(Happy thanksgiving)
He robbed and stole and killed for greed and packed us on slave ships
(Happy thanksgiving)
He took us off to stolen lands it seemed like hell for sure
(Happy thanksgiving)
With the crack and the guns, death and disease
They called for you or your
(Happy thanksgiving)
No whips, no brew, no weed to smoke, not a single luxury
If not for the bloodshed that it cost the struggle would be lost
(Say it again)
The struggle would be lost
(Say it again)
The struggle would be lost
(Say it again)
The struggle would be lost
(Say it again)
The struggle would be lost
(Say it again)
The struggle will be lost, lost
If you continue to do the shit you be doing with disloyalty, nigga
Now that explains why in each ward you avoiding me, nigga
Knowing now it takes nothing to start destroying a nigga
Conditioned with a mind to shit on your brother
Flossing with jewelry and whips just like a dick
And still live with your mother
Copping shit that superseded your salary
Where is your loyalty to your own blood
And taking care of your family?
Funny how you sit and drink what you drink
Thinking the foulest shit and not even knowing
Why you think how you think
Must be the reason why we aren't aware
Because the devil know how guilty and filthy he is in all his affairs
Fucking with my mind when I was a youngster
'Cause he know if we knew the truth
We'd make his ass run from amongst us
That's why we thinking that it's better to ball
While the devil be sitting and watching, plotting how to murder us all
Now this is the tale of a murderer who comes from the Caucus Cliffs
(Happy thanksgiving)
He robbed and stole and killed for greed and packed us on slave ships
(Happy thanksgiving)
He took us off to stolen lands it seemed like hell for sure

The struggle would be lost
The struggle would be lost, lost
Hey yo, that's why I'm hustling harder
Now I'm in a huddle seeing the struggle in my mother and father
That's why my persona will come with
Such a karma to be getting this paper
'Cause I ain't with the slavery labor
A lot of niggas in the hood probly relate to me greater
Than those that believe when they die they probly
Meet the creator that's crazy, how we become slaves
To mental death and power that comes
With becoming even more of a dumber ass
The devil robbing you blind, concealing the truth from niggas
While we be struggling they murder the mind
The wickedness sneak on you quicker
When they creep from behind continue to speak
The truth 'til it weaken your spine
Now check it, the jewel I give you be the beat the beat for the time
You can't see it like you living on a street for the blind
Young whitty hustler niggas that stick with the grind
Fly cuisine food poisoned 'cause you eatin' the swine
I stay struggling and doing for Delf
Then I dig in my body deeper and do a little knowledge of self
They wonder why they catch a nigga on the weed sell
Better be careful what you saying on them e-mails
Now listen, they got your mind in a prison
You can do whatever you want but focus if you desire to listen
As I say it and I hope you feeling the wrath
Create a hammer to make a man that a beat
You in the head with the math
