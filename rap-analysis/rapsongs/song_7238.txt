Check this out my nigga, there's a lot of niggas out here
That got a lot of shit to motherfuckin' say
But when a nigga bring it to them niggas
They can't stand up for what they motherfuckin' said
Naw, I ain't say that, he said that
Stand up if you got somethin' to say, my nigga
Stand up for what you said, my nigga
Tell them niggas bring it to the square, nigga
Stand up, if you don't like what I'm sayin' then buck
Swang when you see me, we can throw them hands sucker
Stand up, if you aint notice, nigga, I don't give a fuck
If I said it, then I meant it an' what? Fuck, nigga
Stand up, you don't wanna see the trigger man buss
Hit you an' your man's up, make it hard for a niggas to stand up
Tell your crew they don't want it with us dude
An' if the motherfuckas do, bust a motherfuckin' move, stand up
You got a alligator mouth an' a hummingbird ass
Your mouth writin' checks that ya ass can't cash
One forty five an' I'm outta ya weight class
Wanna survive? You better scramble like eggs an' break fast
'Cause I know how to handle ya fake ass
I'm ride on ya an' hide ya in yesterday's trash
Pull up in the Chevy, sprayin' rounds through the glass
See you layin' face down in the grass an' I laugh
Ha, that's the end of the saga
The end of my problems, nigga mash the Impala
Go lay up with a model an' watch the news tomorrow
An' that's the end, checkmate, game over, I'll holla
Now I'm tellin' ya, potna, you don't know whatcha doin'
Don't recognize the trouble ya gettin' into an' ya ruined
Hey, dig this man, I spent my childhood in a wild hood
An' all that gangsta shit ya talkin', yeah, it sound good
But make it understood, you gonna have to show me
I'm a OG, you wanna overthrow me
Stand up, if you don't like what I'm sayin' then buck
Swang when you see me, we can throw them hands sucker
Stand up, if you aint notice, nigga, I don't give a fuck
If I said it, then I meant it an' what? Fuck, nigga
Stand up, you don't wanna see the trigger man buss
Hit you an' your man's up, make it hard for a niggas to stand up
Tell your crew they don't want it with us dude
An' if the motherfuckas do, bust a motherfuckin' move, stand up
Dearly beloved, we gathered here today
To marry this young nigga in his own special thug way
Do you promise to love an' respect all of the real niggas?
An' when the problem come, learn to deal with 'em?
Do you swear to turn the chopper on any motherfucker in ya path
Or any bitch, that's tryin' to stop ya?
An' do you promise to keep 'em handy an' don't hand 'em
To nobody, nobody except family?
An' keep 'em cocked an' loaded an' don't expose 'em to nobody
Unless somebody want 'em in his body
To love an' cherish 'em from his trigger to his barrel
From the bottom of ya heart, to death do you fuckin' part
Do you understand to live the life by him, is to sell ya soul
An' Lord knows you gonna die by him
I know you heard gun stories about John Wayne an' Billy the Kid
Sheed, all them motherfuckers dead
An' did you know that every other bitch from the Wild Wild West
End up dyin' from hollow points to they fuckin' chest
'Cause they ain't never seen or cocked beamed a milli fourteen
Or Tommy gun, with a hundred round fuckin' gun
Stand up, if you don't like what I'm sayin' then buck
Swang when you see me, we can throw them hands sucker
Stand up, if you aint notice, nigga, I don't give a fuck
If I said it, then I meant it an' what? Fuck, nigga
Stand up, you don't wanna see the trigger man buss
Hit you an' your man's up, make it hard for a niggas to stand up
Tell your crew they don't want it with us dude
An' if the motherfuckas do, bust a motherfuckin' move, stand up
Sheed, I'm talkin' about ridin' out tonight
Only way I die first, gotta kill me in this verse
Weezy F, middle finger to life
So nothin' seem critical, in the hood I'm typical
Yeah I'm feelin' good an' spiritual, healin' hoods
With shit up outta my kitchen, I'm pitching it, it's really good
Smokin', drinkin', I'm like a fish an' I'll probably shit on ya bitch
Probably piss on her lips an' she'll probably give you a kiss
Nasty, holly grove classic, parley with a nigga
Probably rob the same bastard, ask him
We don't give a fuck about a casket
Nigga this the murder cappy, niggas just murder happy
Twelve years old, I jumped off the pot
I started sellin' rocks, right after I got shot
I had to hold my weight down
Pussy nigga, stand up or lay down
Stand up, if you don't like what I'm sayin' then buck
Swang when you see me, we can throw them hands sucker
Stand up, if you aint notice, nigga, I don't give a fuck
If I said it, then I meant it an' what? Fuck, nigga
Stand up, you don't wanna see the trigger man buss
Hit you an' your man's up, make it hard for a niggas to stand up
Tell your crew they don't want it with us dude
An' if the motherfuckas do, bust a motherfuckin' move, stand up
