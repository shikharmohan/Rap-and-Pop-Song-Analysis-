(Ice cube, a.k.a. Don Mega)
Put a whoop on 'em
(A.k.a. poppa don)
Put a whoop on 'em
((A.k.a. the big fish)
Put a whoop on 'em
((A.k.a. brainiac)
Keep it gangsta y'all, keep it gangsta

  (Keep it gangsta)
Keep it gangsta y'all, keep it gangsta
  (All my life)
Keep it gangsta y'all, keep it gangs'

Everything is real
On this concrete and steel
Niggaz peel your cap for a happy meal
I got to deal with this ball of confusion
World of illusions
We ain't losin' playa
(Never)
Wes winnin'
Playin' every night
When we sendin' paper chasin', grinin'
While you still chasin' women
'Round tables, no lieutenants
(No lieutenants)
You go own man grown
(Get up)
It's ice cube and the family stone
Breakin' bread every night in L.A.
(In the night)
And I pray, for one more day that's unate
(Check)
It's ninety degrees no enemies in sight
Even the Don gotta fall
To his knees every night
Can I get twenty-four more hours
(Can I get, get?)
Without dealin'
With these killers and these cowards?
(Can I can, can?)
I don't wanna loose
All I wanna do is win
I fucked up today
Can I try it again?
I'm lovin' every breath
Like a cold sip of soda
While I'm bankin'
Down these back streets
Thanks for lookin' over
(Thank you)
Damn sure nice to know ya
Fuck a four leaf clover
And thanks for this range rover
We gets down
With this underground gangsta shit
Politicians and parents
Always havin' a fit
Everybody wanna know
Who you with? Where you from?
Why you lookin' at me dumb?
Here's a bullet 'cause you number one
Nobody knows
The fate of a platinum rap star
(Nobody knows)
We gotta wait until tommorow
(Yea, yea)
And I'm a nigga like you
(Yea, yea)
You know I got the bar
Can I get twenty-four more hours
(Can I get, get?)
Without dealin'
With these killers and these cowards?
(Can I can, can?)
I don't wanna loose
All I wanna do is win
I fucked up today
(Huh, huh, huh, huh)
Can I try it again?
Put a whoop on 'em
(Look to Allah)
Put a whoop on 'em
(Pray to your God)
Put a whoop on 'em
(I look to Allah)
Put the whoop on 'em
(Pray to your God)
Mr. Prosperity
These niggaz wanna bury me
Your bitch wanna marry me
Rollin' more than a Cherokee
Don't, I drive what I want
  (Don't)
And what I ain't drivin' I don't want
Let it be known
(Let it be known)
Permits hit the conk in the regal
But weez legal niggaz dollars got bald
Eagles nigga
([inaudible])
You can't undermine Mr. Grime
(Never)
You rappin' 'bout the same shit
I rapped about in eighty nine
Tryin' to be the new fiend
(Never)
With raps complex
They love you one minute
And they hate you the next
Push my lex thru the California sunshine
(Sunsh')
Look back on my life
And say, "Damn, I am done fine"
(Damn, I am done fine)
(Uhh)
Mr. Ice Cube, I'm always on the grime
(Always, always)
The Don Mega Mega
Don Don Mega Mega Don
Can I get twenty-four more hours
  (But I just twenty-four)
Without dealin'
With these killers and these cowards?
(Can I?)
(Dealin' with cowards)
I don't wanna loose
All I wanna do is win
(Yea)
I fucked up today
Can I try it again?
  (Huh, huh, huh, huh)
Keep it gangsta y'all, keep it gangsta
  (Keep it gangsta)
Keep it gangsta y'all, keep it gangsta
  (Everybody)
Keep it gangsta y'all, keep it gangsta
  (Keep it gangsta)
Keep it gangsta y'all, keep it gangs'
  (All my life)
