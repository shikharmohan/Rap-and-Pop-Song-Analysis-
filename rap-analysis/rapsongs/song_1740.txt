[Shock G]
I wanna go up downtown get around town
Out of town for about a month overnight
While the sun's shining bright in the middle
Of the warm cold freezing hot night, that's all
[Money B]
I wanna put it in out through over and under
Shake and bake, first take heed the boots and blunder
I'm ready to feel the ninth wonder, ready for it all
[Shock G]
When I'm way up high I walk the edge I'm on the verge
I get the urge I wanna jump can't do it suicide
But I wonder what it's like to fall, cause I want it all
[Humpty Hump]
Lemme get a fruit juice lemon drop soda pop
Popcorn candy bar chocolate ice cream and hennessy
I want it aalll, yeah, I want it aaallll!
Yo, I want Anita Laquita Shakiyla Lolita
Diana Hannah Rosanna, dookie-braid wearing Kelly
Shelly the redhead and big booty Emily, I want em all
[Clee]
Yo I wanna smoke about an ounce and bounce
To your local discount lah spot picking up large amounts
I wanna pound extra thick quinton asked no questions
Nuff lah for the session, I want it all
I WANT IT ALL! [x4]
[Shock G]
I wanna have a tight body meet a physically fit girl named Holly
Who likes to ride the bikes exercise and go running
But I also wanna lay around the rest and get blunted
[Humpty Hump]
I want a fat crib and a car and boat and a good business
And a dope biznitch to share the fantasy with me
And live virtually responsibility free, I want it all g
[Shock G]
I goes for mine all the time I'm first in line
You better get behind me, you're no friend of mine see
I want it all, I like to kick the knowledge and do good
But I still wanna be that pimp nigga in the hood
Yes, I want it all-ac
