Wanna feel the vibe, wanna feel the vibe
Uhh, wanna, what? Yeah
Wanna, what? Uhh, yeah
(Come on)
Everybod', c'mon, uhh
Yo, yo
(All night long)
Durin' divine hours, I use mind power to refine
[Unverified] girls, and make 'em feel like black pearls
Get they minds off acrylic nails and the rap world
It's a lot you can find in the lost, black girl
Made signs built in lodges, we be in garages
Discussin' who we boned and who God is
Pro-black like Craig Hodges with my dashikis in the cleaners
I kick it for the Chevy, ridin' head to backstreet leaners
All
(Uhh)
Night
(Yea, yea, what?)
Hah
All
(Huh, uhh)

(Now let me get a piece of this)
(Let me get a piece, Bee)
Night
Check it, check it
I was born underwater with three dollars and a cocktail
Tryin' to make the Garden of Eden, out of Auckdale and Rockwell
Lock'd in this grid like a Tupac tale
While her-on rock smells make the cops tail
My third eye is my rail, on this L of thought
With Afrocentric stamps I'm mailin' thoughts
To my Gods held in court
I dwell where rebellion's taught, and emotions seldom walk
I try to 'Walk Like An Egyptian', but hieroglyphics fail to talk
I guess the hustlin' is the unspoken Gospel
Love that I'm an apostle, feel the holy spirit of Chicago
E Bottom, here's the bottle
I think I need a cup of a tea, because I'm novel
(Come on bay-bay)
Bust it
I jus' wanna rock you
All night long
All

What? Yo-yo, yo-yo yo-yo check it, check it
On and on and on and on
A portrait of the Artist, formerly known as Sense
The brain-wash, with my vocal tones I rinses
Opportunity and the beat knocks
Women, give me rhythm like beatbox
But it's the year of completion
I want a Queen to complete Rash'
Who's flavored from stacks to Reeboks
Send blessings to the family of Ice Mike
Shit like that, don't help me write, right, but I got [unverified]
Like a destruction worker, when it's time to build
Get off like Sam Jack' and it's 'Time To Kill'
In perseverance I'ma find a meal and provoke
My gramps used to trick off big papers at the riverboat
It go
All night, all night
All night, you got it goin' all night
All night, y'know, y'know it all night
All night, oah, ahh, hoah, hoh

All night long, oah hoh
(Ebb in feelings)
I jus' wanna rock you
(I ain't sleeping)
All night long
(All night long)
On and on and on and on
Check it, I walk downtown to tempos and never lose the beat
Some people got ignorance confused with bein' street
On the street of desire, my body and soul meet
Arguin' over thick broads and meals with no meat
Had the cold feet for a second
Mega-niggaz in my box throwin' suggestions
Had me checkin' myself and double checkin', I popped the 'Resurrection'
In the mirror I only heard my reflection
Let me hold mics, while you hold dicks and CD collections
And at MusicLand and Coop's, we can make connections
I meditate with confidence, to not chomp on cents
Outspoken like 30's but yet I guard my lips writin' niggaz with stripes
I hold posture with poppin' shit to fat broads
Wearin' ostrich, givin' 'em voice mail
Tracks are like County to them I voice [unverified]
If you believe in Heaven, why is the choice Hell?
Why is this choice Hell? Why is this choice Hell?
I jus' wanna rock you
All night long, ohh, ohh
(Keep goin')
I jus' wanna rock you
(Keep goin', keep goin', keep on)
(And don't you give up)
All night long
(Ah, keep on, ah, keep on)
Ohh, ohh
(Ah keep on, ah, keep, ah, don't you give up)
I
(All night long)
Jus' wanna rock you

All night long
(If you want it, you can have it, lay upon my rest)
On and on and on and on
(Keep it goin' baby)
(If you want it, you can have it, lay upon my rest)
I jus' wanna rock you

All night long
(If you want it, you can have it, lay upon my rest)
