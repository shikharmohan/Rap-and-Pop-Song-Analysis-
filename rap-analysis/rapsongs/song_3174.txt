(Doin' what it 'pose 2do)

(Doin' what it 'pose 2do)

(Doin' what it 'pose 2do)
You know my shit shine
(Doin' what it 'pose 2do)
I make the bitch mind
(Doin' what it 'pose 2do)
Had to come through, shine on you niggaz
Stop lyin' on a nigga, got my nine on your liver
Fuck around and go, blind on a nigga
Do time for a nigga, put your mind on your mirror
All you niggaz that's materialistic
Don't fuck wit'cha boy or become a statistic
Ice Cube is very artistic
But I'm still from the hood, will take your existence
So motherfuckers tryin' scratch my paint
It's West Coast in the house, what the fuck you thank?
I'm big bank guy, spent on my outfit
'Cause I'm fly and your ass ain't about shit
I let that bullshit do what it 'pose to do
Go to the club, grab me a hoe or two
Understand, God has a chosen few
Fuck around and I'll put some holes in you
You see my lo' lo'
(Doin' what it 'pose 2do)
And that fo' do'
(Doin' what it 'pose 2do)
You know my big watch
(Doin' what it 'pose 2do)

(Doin' what it 'pose 2do)
Now e'ry motherfucker in here bitchin', we rollin'
In that big body wide thang, a nigga patrollin'
Y'all jealous of the ass that a nigga be holdin'
Ain't scared of the po' po' and what they patrollin'?
Gotta job motherfucker, I work for myself
I got benefits bitch, dental and health
I do it 24/7, I rob 7-11
If I had to, I take it straight back to heaven
'Witta Attitude', I got the Range blowed out
So if you jack me homey, I never jump out
I just tickle these switches and tickle these bitches
That's lickin' all on my paint job like liquorish
I know a lotta dances, they call me Jolly Ranchers
'Cause I shine like Rudolph, nigga fuck Prancer
Ice Cube, reflect like chrome
When I'm in the hood, I run it like Rome
You see my lo' lo'
(Doin' what it 'pose 2do)
And that fo' do'
(Doin' what it 'pose 2do)
You know my big watch
(Doin' what it 'pose 2do)

(Doin' what it 'pose 2do)
Call her ass right there, she got that kush
And I'ma run all through it like Reggie Bush
And I'ma hit that bush like George Bush
In the middle of the night like a crook
Don't fuck with her, her ass is average
Only fuck with the ones with the whole package
Who gives a fuck if yo' ass look good
If yo' ass can't cook good, that's on the hood
Fine bitches, you shit out of luck
'Cause I'm prolly gon' eat more than I fuck
You got do it all, not just send them all
Cook and cleaning, love a nigga's shitty drawers
Naw, I'll keep you flossin' up at Ready Tellers
The kinda shit that make them other bitches jealous
Pull up, jump out, I'm like new money
And watch the bees in the house come and get the honey
You see my lo' lo'
(Doin' what it 'pose 2do)
And that fo' do'
(Doin' what it 'pose 2do)
You know my big watch
(Doin' what it 'pose 2do)
I make the bitches watch
(Doin' what it 'pose 2do)
I see that big ass
(Doin' what it 'pose 2do)
When you walk pass
