Got niggaz in the pen tryin' to see me wit' a Grammy
Wanna be me and don't even understand me
Couldn't see me even if you was standin' with me up
I'm that damn convincing not invisible that mans invincible
And advance a little due to the pine
My niggaz call me little Russell Crowe
For my beautiful mind
And I let you do the time I do the crime
When the crowd call my name, I bring my crew to the line
