My french girls love it when we smoke the ooowee (translate)
Um bela' France I do when we smoke the oowee
I do me she feel me coming like new teeth (ow)
I got paper like loose leaf 
Come over here and maybe you could get a few sheets
My body's unique like the Sistine Chapel (yeah) (fresh)
Fresh six green apples
I should cut myself to see if my bloods red
Baby I brainstorm, call me floodhead
Married to the money and if she leaves me bury me Monday (hmm)
Knowin your not good then your arrogance is funny
And when your really rich then asparagus is yummy
