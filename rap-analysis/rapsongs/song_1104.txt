Yo, I don't know what was on y'all niggaz birds
To go up to the boat, and start robbin' old folks
Now see you done messed with the wrong old lady
You done went wild, yo, check it
There was a Hardy Boy mystery, I tried to solve again
Dude that broke in my crib, it wasn't involvin' him
Four in the mornin', my phone ringin'
I'm thinkin', "Who da fuck is this", on the other line screamin'
Told' em, "Keep down", but they was breathin' hard
It was my grandmother tellin' me that she had been robbed
I told her hold, tight, I'd be right over
Freezin' but this situation made the night colder
Knew this was the night, that she played poker
With some friends in a club at the boat gettin' bub'
Said she seen these thugs on the boat for a while
Not gamblin' but every now and then they'd smile
Then blaow, they had Mag's
And told everybody, "Put your shit in the bag"
Made people strip naked, quicker than a Luke record
Had the place took in a minute and some seconds
Asked her how many of it was 'em? Said she couldn't remember
She was spooked and buzzin', couldn't describe 'em
'Cause it happened too fast, said they looked like me
With they pants hangin' off they ass
Got her some water, and begin to think
How these niggaz take her wig, her bracelet and her mink?
Somebody 'round the crib know the deal
Whoever did it better have Blue Shield for real
'Cause yo, it's the big payback
Later that day I went to the shop, to see what was up
Them niggaz probably knew somethin' plus I needed a cut
Walked in they was playin' Jigga
Discussin' how Da Brat titties done got bigger
These niggaz next to me, was talkin' 'bout the heist
Whoever did it even got Jordan for his ice
Said that it was done so precise the cops ain't know nuthin'
Had to use all my might not to ask no questions
Put down the magazine, went to the pop machine
Noticin' these cats, had the Bling Bling
They wouldn't be talkin' if they did it, it could be they team
A week ago neither one of these niggaz had a ring
This Hype came in, sellin CD's, said the BD's
Was braggin' 'bout robbery they had done
By now, I'm thinkin' 'bout my gun if I see gramps bracelet
I'ma play racist and make niggaz run, it's the big payback
My imagination roamed as I got in the chair
Thinkin' when shit went down, I was I was there
Fuckin with fam' who you are, I don't care
Have your guys pourin' liquor witch'ya name in they swear
These chicks claim they was there, knew the niggaz who done it
Said it was Smoke and them from the Wild 100's
Eight million stories got me runnin' in place, it's gettin' tricky
Like dude, that do drum 'n' bass
There was a air in the place, that made me suspicious
Normally, they'd be talkin' like bitches
My barber cut me with a quickness
Asked him where he got the new bracelet
He said it was his sister's, I knew then
What made it official, he gave me my change
The money clip had gramp's initials
As I, whooped his ass up, six niggaz masked up
Pulled up in a Cadillac truck
Three-alarm fire and really a possible homicide
The building is entitled, "The Ultimate Barbershop"
There are six unidentified bodies in the building
They are all presumed dead, I repeat they are all presumed dead
However there are no suspects, I repeat the subjects are at large
We might need some backup
Inform O'Malley that we need backup, over
The skit definitely needs more survey added to it
Plus a new writer for the script, thank yo
Someone get Prince Paul on the phone please
