Meet mark and pardon me to heat mark a Dutch spark it
Lex Leonardo arts profit, apple cranberry mixed with crystal
Fan worry desert mountain crib in the ground
We arsonists one point five a liter take a taste
Splash your heater, smack your face twice
Clap your sneakers
Shit is like a mission to Mars fishin' for bars
Takin' what's ours knowledge the car Pa
Don't be stupid, get a little cash better swoop it
Throw it in the ground and recoup it
Next check was best your family pack your shit
Get vexed leave a nigga standing in a bag of leaves
Some niggas catch on later try to put them on they haters
I met eighty of them niggas yo, waitin' on the sidelines droolin'
Some need schoolin' let me teach you, enroll a student what
Rule one, yo respect if you lose son
Don't be big back the barrel on the move done
All hell to niggas in jails with sharks in they fishtanks
Now he come home he a whale
Wolves in the projo's, projo's yo
We realer up in my shows yo, middle finger five O's
Take time to climb vines yo
Lay on the lines like Lauri only lovin' rare kind
Sun splash cash layin' like three bags of hash
Fully wrapped in a Indian man's stash
