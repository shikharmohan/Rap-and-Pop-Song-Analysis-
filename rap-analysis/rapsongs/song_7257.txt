[Pharrell - Verse 3]
And it don't stop
A lot of n-ggas out there think that they can do what we do
be my guest, go front for the people
but just like a store front, they gon see through
that you sweet like bubble gum and they gon eat you
how you blowing up n-gga, they chewing you
and when you hit rock bottom, they shoo'ing you
like "ooh you, ooh, get away"
Not you, yeah right, ok
Don't listen to these guys
these n-ggas full of lies
cut em open and they cover up the floor, you surprised
everytime they talk about what they gon get
they been looking at my blog, knife and forking my sh-t
while I'm tryna get the new G-5 with the kit
with the bed in the back cause my son hate to sit
and all that dark blue sh-t, ya'll n-ggas been had
my diamonds rainbow like the register for black
every aspect where the plane (?)
(?) brightness like a chain poster have
got it from the ring so they know that its great
plus the Audemar, i guess my wrists couldn't wait to tell yaÃ¢Â¦
[Chorus]
