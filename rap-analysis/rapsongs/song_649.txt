We paper chase and smoke blunts
You'll never find a thuggish bunch of niggas like us
Don't be so quick to test us I'll be annoyed and might bust
I'ma have to talk to Eazy through the ouija, so I can see
If maybe he can tell me why you hatin' on me
Bitin' on me, why you want me to show a nigga leatherface in me
Don't fuck around nigga he's a real buck 'em down nigga
Motherfuck rappin' how bout fuckin' with me now nigga
Niggas get your checks from your broads get high
Then your broads sneak your keys from your niggas and ride
Everybody wanna party even the niggas with a problem
Hey nigga we can solve em, 'cause bitch we'll squash 'em
Don't know me, fuck you when you got beef
But you also got the clone styles and all motif
See me rappin' on your TV actin'
And it's a fact that when you see us in person
Think we gon' flex or show you no action
Down for mine, gotta show a nigga time to time
So I figure I'll slow down the rhyme
So they can understand I feel with so much anger and pain
And if I drop then I'll explode like a fuckin' grenade, nigga
Fuck calm time to ring the alarm
Break the niggas out of prison killin' all the guards, woo!
Power to the people givin' people the power to put it down in your city
And fuck them hillbillies nigga I can't stand no motherfuckin' po-po
When will we start killin' these bitches and takin' no more
Mo thug the only clique that I claim although we all beyond the bangin'
You could say I roll with a gang and dissing chin checkers in the makin'

Flippin' the flow then let it burn
What if the pistols and police stay strong for the Bone
Bitch, you fuckin' with all of the black cat feet
And in 1999 when ya meet up in Egypt
Bet it be no peace to release the beats
Settle with the streets and get 'em all peace
Get up and at least we don't take defeat
Bitch never retreat, nigga lose your arms
Better use your feet pick up my cannon nigga yeah yeah yeah
Get up off the rock

Come and get fucked up
And get out the county nigga get rowdy take out a bounty
Disappear-pear, in an alley, reappear-pear, off in Cali
And you feel me daddy, proudly I done stalk like a mad man
And went through shit in Cleveland with the band
Now look at me platinum, fuck the rap and the corner bitch
Made Hation nation nowadays an occupation
So why you hate me still can't fade me away
