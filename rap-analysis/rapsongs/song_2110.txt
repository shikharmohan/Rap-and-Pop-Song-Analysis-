I don't know if you don't, I know, whenever the wind blows
I be chasin' all of my cheese, think I'm lyin', silly negro, please
My niggaz is out to get rich, better watch out man 'cause they sick
Somebody better get this dick, I'm about to get sick with this shit
Although them niggaz is tight
As tight as me they never will be
So what? Some niggaz is famous man
Some niggaz is out for they G's
Some niggaz is lovin' hookers man
Some niggaz send hoes to they knees
Some niggaz will rescue a bitch
Some skanless niggaz'll let the ho bleed
If you gon' ride, nigga go'n ride
If you gon' hide, nigga go'n hide, witcho' bitch ass
If you gon' shoot, nigga go'n shoot, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
If you gon' spook, nigga go'n spook
If you gon' ride, nigga go'n ride
If you gon' hide, nigga go'n hide, witcho' bitch ass
If you gon' shoot, nigga go'n shoot, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
If you gon' spook, nigga go'n spook
The cherries, sirens, got me layin', po po penelopes make
Noises throughout the night, bring the yellow tape
They so lost, bodies bagged up
Streets blocked off, victims air lifted up
Lieutenants, bosses, block monsters, kingpins
Funkin', beefin', killin' they best friends
And to prevent bloodshed we used to try to reason
But right now it's a drought and ain't nobody eatin'
So therefo' there the problem right there
Ain't no jobs provided so I'ma blame the Mayor
Sinister mob throughout the town
Y'all grew up on this shit, y'all love the sound
Y'all threw up on the shit, all on the tar
Got you twisted with the shit, dang near wreck yo' momma's car
Dirty needles, welfare checks
Poverty, despair, housin' projects
If you gon' ride, nigga go'n ride
If you gon' hide, nigga go'n hide, witcho' bitch ass
If you gon' shoot, nigga go'n shoot, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
If you gon' spook, nigga go'n spook
If you gon' ride, nigga go'n ride
If you gon' hide, nigga go'n hide, witcho' bitch ass
If you gon' shoot, nigga go'n shoot, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
If you gon' spook, nigga go'n spook
Smeb with me and Nate Dogg
M.D. 20/20 see that them breathin' alcohol
Drinking too many to the head with me
Eightball, let your anger out, throw it up against the wall
I dropped a C-note, didn't miss it
A little skank from the other side, picked it up and kiss it like
Good luck, you deserve it and you makin' it
Even though my boyfriend, them be hatin' it
I'm a top hat, them cats is mouses
I sport ice, cost mo' than niggaz houses
I'm nothing close to bein' fake
I tried to tell them tricks a long time ago
To get in this rap game, but it's too late
I'm on my way to my, where? Studio session
Switchin' ears, tryin' to get a better reception
Changin' gears, super size
Poppin' wheelies in my brand new ride
If you gon' ride, nigga go'n ride
If you gon' hide, nigga go'n hide, witcho' bitch ass
If you gon' shoot, nigga go'n shoot, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
If you gon' spook, nigga go'n spook
If you gon' ride, nigga go'n ride
If you gon' hide, nigga go'n hide, witcho' bitch ass
If you gon' shoot, nigga go'n shoot, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
If you gon' spook, nigga go'n spook
Glow in the dark night vision, solar ray tinted glass
Power heated side through mirrors, brought back airbags
Off the new with the stump
My Cadillac DTS Deville, 32 valve ain't no punk
Get up outta here some ol' Jacklin and square
Hollered adjitudes and ate the gravel
I said, "I ain't no mark ass any ol' rapper
Potnah I was built for battlin'
And about all that ol' jaw jackin'
You doin' potnah, I ain't playin'
You get your head put on flat,
Think it's a game, I got choppers
Done fucked with jelly jaws
Screwed a few bitches in my car
A temper problem, I can't hide
 Issues, violence, problems deep inside"
Although them niggaz is tight
As tight as me they never will be
So what? Some niggaz is famous man
Some niggaz is out for they G's
Some niggaz is lovin' hookers man
Some niggaz send hoes to they knees
Some niggaz will rescue a bitch
Some skanless niggaz'll let the ho bleed
If you gon' ride, nigga go'n ride
If you gon' hide, nigga go'n hide, witcho' bitch ass
If you gon' shoot, nigga go'n shoot, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
If you gon' spook, nigga go'n spook
If you gon' ride, nigga go'n ride
If you gon' hide, nigga go'n hide, witcho' bitch ass
If you gon' shoot, nigga go'n shoot, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
If you gon' spook, nigga go'n spook
If you gon' ride, nigga go'n ride
If you gon' hide, nigga go'n hide, witcho' bitch ass
If you gon' shoot, nigga go'n shoot, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
If you gon' spook, nigga go'n spook
