Oh, baby, tell the motherfuckers
When it comes to bein' true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh, no you'll never let me down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Yo, first I snatched the streets, then I snatched the charts
First I had they ear, now I have they heart
Rappers came an' went, I've been here from the start
I seen them put it together, watch them take it apart
Seen the rollers roll up wit ribbons
I seen a repoe, resolded, then redriven
So when I reload, he holds number one positions
When you hot, I'm hot an' when your feet cold, mines are sizzlin'
It's plain to see, niggas can't fuck wit me
'Cuz I'ma be that nigga for life, this is not an image
This is God-given, this is hard livin'
Mixed wit Cristal sippin', it's the most consistent
Hov give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc
An' nigga, I'm home on these charts, y'all niggas visitin'
It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordon of rap
I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya' boy
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up
I get down for my grandfather, who took my momma
Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
At the tender age of 6, she was arrested for the sittin'
An' with that in my blood, I was born to be different
Now niggas can't make it to battles to chose leadership
But we can make it to Jacobs an' to the dealership
That's why I hear new music an' I just don't be feelin' it
Racism still alive, they just be concealin' it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even make me show ID to get inside of Sam's Club
I did dirt an' went to church to get my hands scrubbed
I swear I've been baptized at least 3 or 4 times
But in the land where niggas praise, Yukon's are gettin' paid
It's gon' take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than do-rags to get your waves
Nothin' sad as that day, my girl father passed away
So I promise to Mr. Rainey, "I'm gonna marry your daughter"
An' you know I gotta thank you for they way that she was brought up
An' I know that you were smilin' when you seen the car I bought her
An' you sent tears from Heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
'Cuz look what a accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah, now Romeo Must Die
I know I got angels watchin' me from the other side
When it comes to bein' true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh, no you'll never let me down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
We're all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you are part of the math
Cats think I'm delirious, but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe, the world
I'm tryin' to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual, my spirit is a part of this
That's why I get spiritual, but I get my hymns from Him
So it's not me, it's He that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a Heaven-sent instrument
My rhythmatic regimen navigates melodic notes
For your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental
Vibrations is what I'm into, yeah, I need my lubarinde
But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunte Kinte
I'm tryin' 'Give us us free' like sinkay
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talkin' to you, my many inspirations
When I say it I can't, let you or self down
If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest rift
And you slipped off the side and clenched on to your life in my grip
I would never, ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it been known that God's penmanship has been signed
With a language called love, that's why my breath is felt by the deaf
And why my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I, too, dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
'Cuz whenever I open my heart, my soul, or my mouth
A touch of God rains out, take 'em to church
When it comes to bein' true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
I know you'll never let me down
Get up, I get, get up, I get
Get up, I get, get up, I get
Get up, I get, get up, I get down
Who else you know been hot this long?
Started from nothin' but he got this strong
Picked the rock from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you
Peddle bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special
Let you tell that man I thought it, well, somebody must've taught him
'Cause every fourth quarter, I light the Mike Jord' in 'em
Number one albums, what? I got, like, four of them
More of them on the way, the eighth wonder on the way
Clear the way, I'm here to stay, y'all can save the chitter chat
"This an' that", "This an' Jay", this an' Jay'll get you maced
When I start spittin' them lyrics, niggas get very religious
Six Hail Marys please, Father, forgive us
Young, the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas
The way y'all all follow Jigga
Hov's a livin' legend an' I'll tell you why
Everybody wanna be Hov an' Hov's still alive
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
