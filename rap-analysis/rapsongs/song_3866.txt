Never a flaw
A different kind of high
Y'know, feel me on this, huh, uhh
Ladies and gents, your dopest host presents extravagance
In the ladies' frame, leavin' cum stains
Niggaz remain in awe, when I brought a Dillinger
Throw it to ya jaw, uhh
Never a flaw, never before, have you seen such magnificence
In the black princess, yes flow's phenom, I'm the bomb-diggy
Ask Biggie, keep a dedicated squad wit me, call us the Gabbana girls
We dangerous, bitches pay a fee just to hang with us
Trust, niggaz lust, without a bank account
I doubt we could swing that route
Feel me out uhh, I'm used ta
Hangin' wit boosters, in the best name brand with the insane clan
Man listen, my position is lieutenant
Like a block of hash, got the burners up in it
Percent it, I send it back to ya greasy
Freak it Arabic style, sha-muck-daha-steesy
To please me you got to be well off
Bust a shell off, wit a tattoo that starts off
Damn Ma, I love you like the lah, the ganja
Sensimilla, can I feel ya
All I wanna do is touch ya
The ultimate rush, you're drugs baby
Damn Ma, I love you like the lah, the ganja
Sensimilla, can I feel ya
All I wanna do is touch ya
The ultimate rush, you're drugs baby
Uhh, to my niggaz that trick a little
To my bitches that suck dick a little
While they niggaz lick the middle, I'm the Don y'all
High driven Jean Paul Cartier wear
Yeah, enough glorifyin', lyrically electrifyin', bitches by lyin'
'Bout the clothes they be buyin'
Some stores won't even let you whores in
'Til I begin to embarrass that ass and get crass
Kim surpass, all crews
Bitches still drinkin' booze
I sip Crystal and Landcruise
Receive all the oohhs and the ahhhs, the jewels and the cars
Slick nigga, I'm stickin' you Baby Pah, uhh
Yes indeed, flows first class and yours is coach
Like the bag, the Prada mama
Jog five miles a day then I hit the sauna
My girls rock Chanel and smoke mad marijuana
Damn Ma, I love you like the lah, the ganja
Sensimilla, can I feel ya
All I wanna do is touch ya
The ultimate rush, you're drugs baby
Damn Ma, I love you like the lah, the ganja
Sensimilla, can I feel ya
All I wanna do is touch ya
The ultimate rush, you're drugs baby
Inhale this, clench your fist
Then ya, feel the mist through the uterus
Can ya, picture this
Life without me, wake up you're having bad dreams
'Cause ya fiend for a toke
My crew tote Tocques and mink coats
On the cell with the boat
What you thought, we get caught and get bailed out
Fuck the jailhouse, Hennessy on the rocks
Is all we got as we sail out, entrepreneurs
Crystal pourers, be glad we ain't takin' yours
Boring huh, I'm warnin' ya
Style waits for no bitch, a dream bitch
When I fuck with scratch and sniff
Now I stacks the shit, practice it
So no bitch can tax the shit, miraculous
So I can relax a bit and get my toes licked
The drugs nigga, a-hah hah hah!
Damn Ma, I love you like the lah, the ganja
Sensimilla, can I feel ya
All I wanna do is touch ya
The ultimate rush, you're drugs baby
Damn Ma, I love you like the lah, the ganja
Sensimilla, can I feel ya
All I wanna do is touch ya
The ultimate rush, you're drugs baby
