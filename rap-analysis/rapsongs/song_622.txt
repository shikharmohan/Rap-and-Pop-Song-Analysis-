Take me, higher, higher, baby
Can you feel it?
(Feel it, feel it, feel it)
Do you feel the same weed high that I do?
'Cuz I'm so high
(Reefer makes you feel that way)
And I feeling so right
Roll mo, roll mo, let's smoke, I got to get high
I been high since the last song
(Off that la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
And I just been smokin' and smokin'
Smoke another blunt, roll another up
You know that weed can really ease your mind
Every time I smoke a reefer that indo high makes me fly
If everybody smoked a blunt, relieve the mind
The world could be a better place
If everybody took a break
And we all just got wasted float out
(Out, out out)
Smoked out, choked out
(Out, out out, out, out, out)
Pull another O
(Out, out, out)
Let's get P O D ded
(P O D ded, P O D ded)
The weed can't get no better
(No better baby)
20 dollar hollars, all day, everyday
Come around my way, we gone want to stay
Weed makes me hungry, happy and all I can say
Sure I need some more
Don't make me wait, stay awake, fake sleep
Got the weed between the sheets catch me
Mary Jane bless me, open up the dime, stimulate your mind
Slide my thumb up the blunt, open up to what you find in marijuana
I've never been in high times
(Lovin' them high times)
I never been in high times
(But could you tell me)
Am I high enough
(Am I high enough)
Am I high enough
(Am I high enough)
I remember being a little thug
Weed, really didn't know what it was
Then I took a puff and I realized
I should always, stay high
The weed, makes me feel alright
(The weed, alright)
If you feel like I feel, I got half on your dime
If you got weed smoke it, I'm a real weed smoker
If it's mine then I would since its yours you could, you should
If I ain't there when you blaze a blunt nigga huh, please think of me
'Cuz you know a nigga like to get high, high and free
(High)
Smokin' all night, feelin' all right, Bone Thugs get high, so high
High, high, all night, high, high, so high
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my, my, my, my
I know you wonder why I do this love the sky
And I soar up so high this mornin' I was in my bed
Bangin' and ringin' inside my head
I wanted to make love to you baby but last night I got P O Ded instead
So baby don't go away, all I got to say is I gotta have you Mary J
Such a heavenly feelin' I get when I'm taking fat ass blunts to the brain
Oh darlin', I'm going insane and I wish we really can
Kick it at home in America, like it was on in Amsterdam
You heard that I'm, you heard I'm, nothin' but a realer thug nigga
Nothin' less than a killa, I might if I'm makin' a scrilla
I never knew no one as live as the bone that kick as strong as me
Be rippin' the bong like me, can hit it as long as me
When I need to free my mind I can find, satisfaction in a bag of weed
Everything I need, leave it to the trees
It can make me feel better and everyday I wake we
Be rollin' up blunts and mo blunts and mo blunts
And I keep a case of swiss ha sweets in the trunk
So when I'm rollin', smokin', chokin', just floatin'
Through the city in the drop top, glock cocked, rollin', just rollin'
Me and Mary Jane that's my world, that's my thang
The way she penetrates my brain
Buddha, done blessed me with game
Good game, you wanna chop it up
We can kick it, smoke a patty to the dome
Nigga lay high, thugged out, smokin', all, night, long
The weed can't get no better
(No better baby)
The weed can't get no better
(No better baby)
The weed can't get no better
(No better baby)
