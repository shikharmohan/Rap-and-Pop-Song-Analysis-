One time
Huh, all up in ya like a bone when I
Johnny Blaze, the Iron Lung
Foxy Brown, the Ill Na Na
Destination, plat'
Yo Na Na, so ill, first week out
Shipped a half a mil, niggaz freaked out
She's all about sex, pard-on, check your facts
And the track record, I'm all about plaques
Shakin' my ass, half naked, lovin' this life
Waitin' for 'Kim' album to drop, knowin' it's tight
Standin' center stage, closin' the show, holdin' a gat
Since you opened up, I know you're hopin' it's wack
Niggaz, screamin' my name on record straight whylin'
Maybe I'll answer back when you reach a hundred thousand
This is ladies night and the Mercedes's tight
When I'm coming home? Maybe tonight
Leave my food by the microwave, kiss the baby goodnight
It's my time to shine, it's playtime tonight
I'ma try to stand my ground, know when I fall
I left your ass home alone, hopin' I call
Who's got the illest pussy on the planet?
Sugar walls comin' down, niggaz can't stand it, the Ill Na Na
True Absolut Vodka, straight shots
For the has-beens and have-nots, dolla dolla
Real and it don't stop, we movin' up
First the mansion then the yacht, sound proper
Straight cash get got, bloodhounds
Tryin' to hunt down the Brown Fox, the Ill Na Na
No more sexin' me all night, thinkin' it's alright
While I'm lookin over your shoulder, watchin' the hall light
You hate when it's a ball, right? Ladies, this ain't handball
Nigga hit these walls right before I call Mike
In the morning when it's all bright, eggs over easy
Hope you have my shit tight when I open my eyes
While I'm eatin', gettin' dressed up, this ain't yo' pad
I left some money on the dresser, find you a cab
No more, sharin' I pain, sharin' I made
It's time to outslick niggaz, ladies sharin' our game
Put it in high gear, flip the eye wear
Nas ruled the world but now it's my year
And from, here on I solemnly swear
To hold my own like Pee Wee in a movie theater
Yeah, I don't need a man's wealth
But I can do bad by my damn self
And uhh
Who's got the illest pussy on the planet?
Sugar walls comin' down, niggaz can't stand it, the Ill Na Na
True Absolut Vodka, straight shots
For the has-beens and have-nots, dolla dolla
Real and it don't stop, we movin' up
First the mansion then the yacht, sound proper
Straight cash get got, bloodhounds
Tryin' to hunt down the Brown Fox, the Ill Na Na
Uhh, vodka
Not, not
Dolla dolla, stop stop
C'mon c'mon, yah, it's the Ill Na Na
No more waitin' to exhale, we takin' deep breaths
Ladies take this over, I be Fox so peep this
Love thyself with no one above thee
'Cuz ain't nobody gon' love me like me
If he, don't do the right thing like Spike Lee
Bye bye Wifey, make him lose his Nike's
Hit the road
Mami told me in order to find a prince
You gotta kiss some toads
Who's got the illest pussy on the planet?
Sugar walls comin' down, niggaz can't stand it, the Ill Na Na
True Absolut Vodka, straight shots
For the has-beens and have-nots, dolla dolla
Real and it don't stop, we movin' up
First the mansion then the yacht, sound proper
Straight cash get got, bloodhounds
Tryin' to hunt down the Brown Fox, the Ill Na Na
