Mister landlord step off my yard
Mister landlord step off my yard
Mister landlord step off my yard
Mister landlord step off my yard
Mister landlord I understand
You have a right to check out your land 'cuz it's your land
My family told me you've been peekin' in windows
Forcing them to be a little scared, keeping curtains closed
I protect my house but on tour
I try to find a home where my people are secure
Your racist views are the views of your own
So please don't let it enter my family zone
Just lettin' you know, I'm not a little old colored boy
That steps off the curb when you walk your walk
So please don't mistake my kindness for blindness
I've known your game since Columbus came
And if I woulda known how your neck was burnin' red
In your complex I wouldn't of been caught dead
So here's my message from me to you
My space is off limits until we move
You understand that
Mister landlord step off my yard
Mister landlord step off my yard
Mister landlord step off my yard
Mister landlord step off my yard
Mister landlord I have to question
Do you expect me to chill while you're bumrushin'?
You thought we were the passive kind, well, you're mistakin'
You outta give nuff respect like I'm Jamaican
The point is I feel you endanger my pride
Your racist comments, your racist approach I ain't with
It's bad enough there's kids in there that are strugglin'
Finding themselves with out you bringin' racism
Just to bring peace do I have to get a piece?
And in the break of dawn I guess I'll pray to the east
'Cuz I'm not the one to get slapped on the cheek
Without my fist curling up to hit you back in your teeth, yo
Free yourself
Free yourself
Freedom
Is what we want not a fight
Waving confederate flags and gun toting is your type
You ever heard of Ogune, well, soon his spell
Will clear my brain while he clears where I dwell
I call on the natural forces that be
To help to free me, to free me
