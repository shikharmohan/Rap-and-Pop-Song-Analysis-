If I ruled the world, was king on the throne
I'd make peace in every culture, build the homeless a home
I'm not runnin', for Congress or the President
I'm just here, to tell the world, how my story went
You see first it was a dream, I was livin' in Rome
And then I moved to London, bought a brand new home
And everywhere I went, I drew lots of attention
Like a stretch Limousine, one of those new inventions
It took a few years 'fore the day had come
But I was ruler of the world ranked number one
So I headed towards Washington to claim the crown
Let the whole world know that, the King was in town
As I, arrived, the crowd started to cheer
And then someone yelled out, "The King is here"
So I headed toward stage, to make a speech
About the new style of livin' I was gonna teach
If I ruled the world
I'd love all the girls, I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
If I ruled the world
People started flowin' as they reached for my hand
I said, "Thank you for bringin' me to the promised land
But now I must go, say goodbye to everybody
Tonight I'll see you all at my super dinner party"
And late that night, at my super dinner party
I was dancin' to the beat and entertainin' La-Di-Da-Di
The music started endin', it was time for a speech
The crowd started sittin' as I rose from my feet
And this was once a dream, I explained to the crowd
Now, I rule the world and I feel so very proud
Excuse me please, for stoppin' this show
I just had to thank you all, huh, and me so
My first day in office, the King on the throne
I spent my first three hours on the telephone
You know with newsmen, reporter, and voter too
I had so many calls, I didn't know what to do
You know out of that office I continued to work
I signed so many papers, my fingers started to hurt
Then I shook off the pain, say this ain't no thing
'Cause there's nothin' in the world like bein' number one King
If I ruled the world
I'd love all the girls, I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
If I ruled the world
Now, I rule the world and now I'm on top
And I'm rollin' with folks that could never be stopped
And I'm here to let you know this is where I belong
And to you sucker MC's that sing my song
And it's a song that's strong about right and wrong
And I'm rock it to you, baby, baby, all night long
And it's a song about love, happiness
In a world of peace, and you know that's fresh
Now I'm the king and I want you to know
That I'm the master blaster rapper who's runnin' the show
And to all of you rappers in every country
You better stop what you're doin' and listen to me
'Cause we gotta stop war and use unity
To fight crime and hunger and poverty
'Cause the African baby is dyin' overseas
While you sucker mission politicians bustin' out Z's
Twenty million people all unemployed
While the rich man try to play Pretty Boy Floyd
While the working class just struggles hard
Try to make ends meet against all odds
While the poor man can't even deal with life
You know he tried to escape and smoked coke on the pipe
Well it's time for a change, to a better way
'Cause the sun has gotta shine through the cloudy day
So listen up world, while I teach this class
And take heed to the message or ain't gonna last
'Cause I know, the solution, is the contribution
Of woman and man to join the revolution
That'll take your brain to a higher plane
An' help you deal in a world gone insane
With the problems that I know we can stop
From the ruler of the world and the man on top
But the years went by and time was up
And thn ruler of the world had ran out of luck
And all the people at the time who said they were my friends
They didn't know, when my job come to an end
They came up to my face, as happy as can be
He was running his mouth like, Muhammad Ali
So I shook his hand calmly as I headed to the door
On my way to the ghetto to treat once more
You rule the world
I'd love all the girls, I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
If I ruled the world
I ruled the world, if I ruled the world
I'd love all the girls, I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
If I ruled the world
I ruled the world
I'd love all the girls, you know, I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
If I ruled the world, baby
I ruled the world
I'd love all the girls, yes, you, you, you
Black diamonds and pearls, black diamonds, black diamonds
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
I'd love all the girls, I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
