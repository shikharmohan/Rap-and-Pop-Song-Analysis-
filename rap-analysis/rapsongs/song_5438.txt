When I walk up in the club, they be pushin'
Misdemeanor got that ice that keep 'em lookin'
Crop top, drop tops on my Phantom, man
They be trippin' and them haters just pussies
Feelin' on me, feelin' on me like a porn star
I drive a fast car, still shave my chocha
Get the cash, get the cheddar, get the beans mean
Ching-a-ling, bling bling, my money real green
Who dat? Who dat? Player better fall back
St-step back, player better fall back
Click clack, cock back, semi-automatic track
Drink a lot of Similac, shorty better fall back
I fall down, get up then I gotta dust it off
Say you dust it off? Yeah, I quickly dust it off
I'm off the wall, I do brawl, don't stall, yes it's on
Said it's on, I can't be cloned, you can call me Mike Jones
305-212-804, my cell
Y'all must be dumb as hell if y'all think that is my cell
Hotel, motel, holiday, don't play 'round the way, OJ
Yeah, I'm so icey
What them haters say? Misdemeanor okay
Call me foreplay, position more than forty ways
Like a chocolate glaze, I'm hotter than a summer day
Stingray, Sugar Ray, knuckles all up in your face
Who dat? Who dat? Player better fall back
St-step back, player better fall back
Click clack, cock back, semi-automatic track
Drink a lot of Similac, shorty better fall back
I block-a, block-a, straight jocker
Matter fact, a face snapper
Money stacker, no slacker
Hit rapper, gun strapper
I click, click hear my click, click
Two snaps, you hit, then I click, click
I make cash, pay them bills
I pay them bills that buy new wheels
I wear high heels, I touch and feel
Catch me in your man grill
My record deal, my movie deal is super sick, sick
I click, click and if you doubt me then I click, click
Smack them boys, I will destroy
Hit, hit, straight down and split, split ya boy
I kick, kick like Karate flick, flicks
You get your ass bit, don't make me have to click, click
Who dat? Who dat? Player better fall back
St-step back, player better fall back
Click clack, cock back, semi-automatic track
Drink a lot of Similac, shorty better fall back
