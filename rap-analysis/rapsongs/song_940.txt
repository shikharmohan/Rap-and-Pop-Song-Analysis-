Uugh, yeah, yeah here we go y'all
Here we here we here we go y'all
Busta Rhymes Flip mode y'all
Yeah, yeah y'all extinction level event shit
Bomb threat to the whole world
What what what is going on
What the fuck going on here?
Check it out yo
Holy amazing grace about face
Total erase you niggaz off the face of the place
Such a shame I had to go grab the Calico
Pass the dough before you find out what I had to blast you for
Extreme laws for ones who did try to go against this
Wet your shit up like a sloppy tongue kiss
But don't know what you talkin' about
Without a doubt where my live niggaz give me a shout
On the strength shit niggaz check for
Connect the four shots and guess who blew it from next door
Time after time we gonna shine again
Feel it like a broad getting fucked from behind again
Ay yo, I be the closest thing to the next
Like the pain and suffering of about a million deaths
I'm only here to present
And bring the impact of the extinction level event
Sing the song of salvation
La la la la laa la la
  (What y'all gonna do where the fuck you gonna go)
La la la la laa la la
  (Where the fuck y'all niggaz gonna run
  (Where y'all niggaz think y'all running to son)
La la la la laa la la
  (Bomb threat to the world
  (What the fuck going on with y'all niggaz out here)
La la la la laa la la
  (We are now a soldier at dawn
  (Of glory emergency motherfuckas)
Yo, disregard your whole assignment
Crooked ass nigga need some realignment, now all refinement
Crazy shit that do make me wanna know where my mind went
Blacking out building hostillity getting violent
Straight giving niggaz an ass whipping on consignment
Then I bust your shit 'til the day of my whole retirement
Shakin' and rattle like we ready to battle
Fight seeing at every angle like a motherfuckin' satellite
Quickly bust up your crotches and fuck up your process
Bouncing in like even saying, 'Adios', or even, 'Buenos Notches'
Have y'all niggaz wildin' havin' a fit
Flame throwing lyrics like a bunch of blowtorch in this shit
Grand spectacular, chainsaw massacre
Thug fanatics street shit that be on the creep coming after you
Then we hit you with the most significant time bomb
Ready to designate at the slightest wave of a white arm
Best form of advice I could give is remain calm
The repercussion is something
You could never imagine would be going on
Never believe in your eyes
When my squad some through at an astronomically large size
Moving the mountains
Keeping all of my niggaz bouncing
Big up my bitches in the place who be screaming and shouting
And I'm only here to present
And bring the impact of the extinction level event
Sing the song of salvation
La la la la laa la la
  (Once again as we welcome all motherfuckers in the world)
La la la la laa la la
  (To experience the extinction level event)
La la la la laa la la
  (The dawn of global emergency)
La la la la laa la la
  (The moment where we all come together as one unison)
La la la la laa la la
  (And completely dominate all global events)
La la la la laa la la
  (We about to completely destroy all the whack bullshit)
La la la la laa la la
  (That we got going on in our every and any reach)
La la la la laa la la
  (All my live niggaz all my live bitches its motherfuckin' on)
La la la la laa la la
  (As we enter the new millennium with this rap shit)
