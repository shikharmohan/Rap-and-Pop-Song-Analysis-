This could be something big..
Don't change the station Ive been impatiently waiting
Pacing welcome to the danger zone
There's a war going on outside and my people got to paint their faces on
Do what I gotta do and what I gotta do is work a flip a dollar
They got no trophies but I got shelf of empty liquor bottles
Not a alcoholic but alcohol it can ease tha pain
Drinkin all my problems away but still playn in Jesus name
Try to turn our voices up and the gov't tones us down
Now tha gas is goin up and the hood is goin down
So the hood is comn for ya and the streets is hungry goons
Comn to a neighborhood near u today or someday soon
Better watch ur back watch ur front and watch ur side to side
Better grab ur gat lik dat blunt tha streets goin 2 ride 2nite
Nd I jus goin 2 ride it out 2 my expiration date 
Cause I go hard in tha paint they softer than paper plates
Make way for revolution and yes u should be scurred 
Cause 1 way or 1 another my people will be heard
