Uhh, yeah, mmm, c'mon
You know how long I've been waitin' for this
Mmm, you know how bad I want this
(Mmm, mmm, mmm)
Kiss me from head to toe
(I will)
Ooh baby I love you so
(C'mon)
My sweet love ain't gon' stop
I'm gon' be your lollipop
(Lollipop)
Kiss me from, head to toe
Ooh baby I love you so
(I know)
My sweet love ain't gon' stop
I'm gon' be your lollipop
Lolli lolli pop pop, boppin' down the block block
I've been lovin' you since junior high, ma you got
Everything I need, everything I want
You're the type of dime a real playa wanna flaunt
Lovin' them lips and the shape of them hips
When I see you in that whack brother's whip, I flip
I hate your boyfriend, that cat is corny
I kick it to you and I dare that clown to run up on me
When nights are stormy
I be thinkin' about your pretty smile, gritty style
But Duke got you locked down like Riker's Isle
I wanna break your man off, I can't control it, I'm a hater
Especially, when your perfume lingers inside the elevator
You're the one, the only one
That I would beg, to give me some
Playerism's for life, eternal flossin', proceed with caution
Baby toss him, divorce him, let the boss in
Kiss me from head to toe
Ooh baby I love you so
My sweet love ain't gon' stop
I'm gon' be your lollipop
(Lolli lolli pop pop)
Kiss me from head to toe
  (Toe, toe)
Ooh baby I love you so
(I know)
My sweet love ain't gon' stop
   (Yeah)
I'm gon' be your lollipop
So ballalistic, mystic, twisted
In my dreams I kissed it, never missed it, I frisked it
Searched it, worked it, lollipopped it and jerked it
You followed, swallowed, scratch my back, baby burped it
Red passion, high fashion
Nobody got to know I'm smashin', I'm sayin' it shorty
Rock, Miss Thang, playin' a childish games
Standin' on the corner knowin damn well I wanna blaze
Sweet get to it anywhere you like
On the rooftop at midnight
The project stairs, I'll be there
Runnin' my fingers through your hair
Anyway, the untouchable, magnetic
Kissable loveable huggable energetic, call a medic
Your man'll regret it, when I hit it I'm athletic
Energize your thighs you'll recognize the size, it's epidemic
Kiss me from head to toe
Ooh baby I love you so
  (Uh, yeah yeah)
My sweet love ain't gon' stop
I'm gon' be your lollipop
Kiss me from head to toe
(Yeah, ha ha)
Ooh baby I love you so
My sweet love ain't gon' stop
  (She's crazy)
I'm gon' be your lollipop
When y'all alone in the Brooklyn Brownstone
Starin' at the high ceilin', what a feelin'
Clothes peelin', finally you're double dealin'
I'm walkin', he's wheelin', it's unreal when
You got the dime of your fantasies
My lollipop ecstasy's on top of me
Just like I thought, it's a small world after all
I don't care if your neighbors hear us down the hall
Make 'em jealous, what they gon' tell us?
If you don't tell your girls baby, I won't tell the fellas
Unless you complain, I orchestrated icebergisms
Visions of my lollipop's thick risen, for my wisdom
Plop plop fizz fizzdom, what I give them
Make yea baby, right there my new anthem
I love you baby, take it deep, deep, deep
Deep, deep, deep, now go to sleep
Kiss me from head to toe
Ooh baby I love you so
(I know)
My sweet love ain't gon' stop
  (How would it?)
I'm gon' be your lollipop
(Lollipop)
Kiss me from, head to toe
Ooh baby I love you so
(Yeah)
My sweet love, ain't gon' stop
(Here we go)
I'm gon' be your lollipop
Kiss me from head to toe
Ooh baby I love you so
My sweet love ain't gon' stop
I'm gon' be your lollipop
Kiss me from head to toe
Ooh baby I love you so
My sweet love ain't gon' stop
I'm gon' be your lollipop
