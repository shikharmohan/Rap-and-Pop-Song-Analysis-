Now you thought I was just 7-7-0, and 4-0-4?
I'm worldwide, bitch act like y'all know, it's the abominabol-hoe man
Globe-trot international post man, neighbor-dick dope man
7-1-8's, 2-0-2's, I send small cities and states I-O-U's
9-0-1, matter fact 3-0-5, I'll jump off the G4, we can meet outside
So control your hormones and keep your drawers on
'Til I close the door and I'm jumping your bones
3-1-2's, 3-1-3's, 2-1-5's, 8-0-tree's
Read your horoscope and eat some horderves
Ten on pump one, these hoes is self serve
7-5-7, 4-1-0's, my cell phone just overloads

Now everyday is a hoe-ly day, so stop the violence
And put the 4-4 away, skeet shoot a hoe today
5-0-4, 9-7-2's, 7-1-tree, whatcha gon' do?
You checkin' out the scene, I'm checkin' a hoe tonight
With perpendicular, vehicular homicide
3-1-4, 2-0-1, too much green, too much fun
I bang cock in Bangkok, can't stop, I turn and hit the same spot
Think not, I'm the thriller in Manilla
Schlong in Hong Kong, pimp 'em like Bishop, Magic, Don Juan
Man after Henny with a coke and a smile
I just pick up the motherfuckin' phone and dial
I got my condoms in a big ass sack
I'm slangin' this dick like a New Jack
(Biatch)
Is it 'cuz they like my gangsta walk?
(Gangsta walk)

Whatever it is, they love it, and they just won't let me be
I handles my biz, don't rush me, just relax and let me be free
Whenever I call, come runnin' 2-1-2 or 2-1-3
You know that I ball, stop frontin' or I'll call my substitute freak
