I had thought I heard u laughin', talkin' trash
Bitch, whats happenin'? Start shit but don't take it
Pull it out, put it on your ass
Some of y'all niggaz still got the game fucked up this year
But I ain't gonna have it
Tryna talk about another mother fucker on a record
And the bitch ain't got no cabbage
Hopin' somebody can tell me whats wrong with this picture
Don't think you can put out what ever you want
And I ain't gonna come back in the bitch and come getcha
I'mma find out where ya hang at
Where ya old lady live and what time you be there
Go scope out ya ride
Follow ya to work and bring that heat
Duck and woo from this fuckin' fool
Monkey see, monkey do
Nigga so you can't be the man right chea too
There's none after this not another livin' M.C. as hazardous
And as talented and handsome, ghetto fabulous
Keep em off my back whenever they comin' I bring that double
In a minute y'all niggaz don't show no love its gonna be trouble
These niggaz here get ya name bent
Washed up anybody y'all sent
Gotta watch these niggaz, they get outta line
Gotta put 'em in they place every time they nut up
Gotta stop 'em from spreadin' them lies
Bust 'em in they mouth and make em shut up
Get up, come here never seen me cut up, you must not be from here
Im four and none here
Don't have me to bring up the shit I've done here
Reach blazin' temperatures
So please come with ya sun gear
Whoop the sleeves off of mutherfuckers that try to run in here
Serious look on my face and a boot in my mouth and balled up fists
These niggaz don't want my trouble
But its too late for 'em, gotta accept this shit
Tryna like me
You would, if you could nigga
You would, if you could nigga
Tryna be like me
You would, if you could nigga
You would, if you could nigga
You wanna do what I do?
You would, if you could nigga
You would, if you could nigga
You wanna take my style?
You would, if you could nigga
You would, but you can't, so u ain't
From the moment that I slid in the door
They know I'm back 'cause you can hear it in the floor
But after I rap bitches ain't feelin' it no more
Wanna talk that shit, better know what to come with
If you jump in the water
Then ya ass better throw up before I start ballin'
And if you ever fuck with what I be recording
I'm ma flush you down the toilet
And if you ever come at me wrong with a mike
I'mma throw you in the gutter
I cant be scared these niggaz
And they disrespect me 'cause I'm from New Orleans
We don't play that shit
When these niggaz and they really want me to get started
Make it painful I don't think so
I be bustin' till I can't
Thats what I where that tank for
Hittin' with the speed of Roy Jones Jr.
And the strength of iron Mike Tyson
Triflin, exciting, well precise
And I gotta let 'em know that I still been right
You talk on me strong
Just 'cause I'm rich don't mean that it don t sound hungry
Count if you wanna
Hope you think 'cause you little I won't jump on ya
You better remember that
When you be droppin' that bullshit
You lucky I'm in a good mood right now
But I'm lettin' you know how it could get
If I was the preacher
Y'all niggaz would run when I step off the pulpit
If I was you I'd leave me alone
'Cause bitch I ain't nothin' to fool with
But if it is on ya mind
You got somethin' to prove, then go head and do it
I get so vivid, I wouldn't be able to make a better picture if I could
You understand my platinum then fuck up my raps, semi tracks
No matter whether kickin' a verse or smokin' a sack
I'll fuck over you, yea
I'm makin' a habit of hurtin' they head and busting' they ass
Fuckin' they woman and takin' they spotlight, makin' 'em mad
Tryna like me
You would, if you could nigga
You would, if you could nigga
Tryna be like me
You would, if you could nigga
You would, if you could nigga
You wanna do what I do?
You would, if you could nigga
You would, if you could nigga
You wanna take my style?
You would, if you could nigga
You would, but you can't, so u ain't
Tryna sound like me
You would, if you could nigga
You would, if you could nigga
Tryna be like me
You would, if you could nigga
You would, if you could nigga
You wanna do what I do?
You would, if you could nigga
You would, if you could nigga
You wanna take my style?
You would, if you could nigga
You would, but you can't, so u ain't
You would, if you could
