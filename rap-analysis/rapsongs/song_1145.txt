Searchin' for love, throughout the ghetto
Young girls thick, righteousness's narrow
I got my third eye on the sparrow
Want my peoples straight and rock sweet apparel
The mother of my child, we not together
Baby it's the back, I got forever
The weather talks to us, him rock
The holy spirit walks through us
Blunted eyes of the youth search for a guide
A thug is a lost man in disguise
To rise and fall of a nation
Even when the buildings tumble, I still stand tall
I walk through the valley wit a life preserver
Feelin' at times, that I might just murder
Yo that ain't what I was sent for
I want folks to say his life it meant more
Than any car, any rock, or any broad
He found geto heaven in himself and God
He found geto heaven in himself and God
He found geto heaven in himself and God
Geto heaven
Need a little geto heaven
Geto heaven
Time we get some geto heaven

Love, your happiness don't begin wit a man
Strong woman, why should you depend on a man?
I understand you want a man that's resourceful
If he pay your bills, he feel like he bought you
Talkin' to a friend, about what love is
Her man didn't love her, 'cuz he didn't love his
Hugged her from afar, said what I felt
Never find a man, till you find yourself
Time helps mistakes, you can learn from
One man F'd up men you shouldn't turn from
You want a certain type of guy, gotta reach a certain point too
At the destination, a king will annoint you
Goin' through the storm, many bodies stay warm
That relationship died, for you to be born, you're worth more
Than anything you could cop in a store
For you to grow he had to go so what you stoppin' him for
Not even I could ignore bein alone it's hard
Find heaven in yourself and God
Find heaven in yourself and God, girl
Find heaven in yourself and God
Geto heaven
Need a little geto heaven
Geto heaven
Time we get some geto heaven

This music is so much bigger than me
As far as happy, it's like a trigger to me
Dealin' with crab rappers, groupie broads
Record execs at times it do be hard
To choose words, be heard across waters
Doin' something you like to support daughters
Keepin' your guys who collectin' court orders
Conveyin' messages the ancestor brought us
Thought of things to say to become the end thing for the day
Somehow, that didn't seem the way for me to make it
Music is a gift that is sacred
I hope you didn't use it hopin' you could grow to it
Whether servin' or a surgeon, you gon go through it
Can't imagine goin' through it, without soul music
It's like Donnie half helped me see Lonnie's fath
On my behalf, let's take whole steps to a ho tep?
And show depth, as we make people nod
Find heaven in this music and God, yeah
Find heaven in this music and God, y'all
Find heaven in this music and God
Geto heaven
Need a little geto heaven
Geto heaven
Time we get some geto heaven
Geto heaven
Time we get some geto heaven
Geto heaven
Need a little geto heaven
Geto heaven
Time we get some geto heaven
