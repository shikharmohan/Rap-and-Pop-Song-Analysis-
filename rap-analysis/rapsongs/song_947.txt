Yeah, come fuck with us yeah
Y'all know what to do to this shit
Yeah, streets
We 'bout to do it again, we 'bout to do it again
We 'bout to do it again niggas, I hope y'all ready
Check it, check it, c'mon
Check out the technique
C'mon, spit flow and bag up the next freaks
Soldier with a quicker hoe that live on the next street
Over playa then do this shit again next week
Gettin' this paper, phat chicks up in the next Jeep
Probably listen closer if you let the check speak
I keep fire 'cause niggas respect heat
Look, I spit fire then come up the best beats
I said I pull the spot from here way down on South Beach major
Globalize, then blow down a South Beach ager
Check it, banana yellow G wagon for the whole saggin'
Feel the fox mink draggin' on the floor watch it
You really need to stop
Just copped the rob blueberry Lamborghini drop
C'mon, stay struntin' with the mini bop
Niggas know when we step in the place, the whole city stop
Better tell 'em if they ain't know, I'm put 'em on Shorty
(We know how you be doin' it baby)
How we be doin' it baby?
(We know how you be takin' it off)
How we take it from 'em?
(We know how you be killin' 'em baby)
How we killin' 'em? C'mon
(We know how you be ready to ball)
You know we ready to do it
(We know how you be drivin' 'em crazy)
Make 'em crazy now, c'mon
(We know how you be breakin' 'em off)
You know we breakin' 'em off, let's go
(So come and get it down for me baby)
Put it down now
(And make it hotter till they take it off)
This is a shake down weakin' your whole shit
Until it break down, speak to the whole clique
Until we take down dudes, put the heat to 'em and make them
Put they cake down dude, scrape down food
Niggas stay hungry 'til the shit is over
Spit and make the tape sound rude
Niggas get screwed, see they ain't really worth not a thing
But only gettin' on the stage to get booed
Kennedy loft hoe's mackin' at the top of the Trump Towers
Rockin' fly Versace, terry cloth robes
Like Ghost Face the most ready just for the glow
Showcase the most, them niggas sure to blow
No waste of time, you know we sure to grow
I'm sayin' no place a mine, is for them corny hoe's
C'mon, with all this paper and this shit we copin'
We keepin' it gully and know we always keep it poppin'
Better tell 'em if they ain't know, I'm put 'em on Shorty
(We know how you be doin' it baby)
How we be doin' it baby?
(We know how you be takin' it off)
How we take it from 'em?
(We know how you be killin' 'em baby)
How we killin' 'em? C'mon
(We know how you be ready to ball)
You know we ready to do it
(We know how you be drivin' 'em crazy)
Make 'em crazy now, c'mon
(We know how you be breakin' 'em off)
You know we breakin' 'em off, let's go
(So come and get it down for me baby)
Put it down now
(And make it hotter till they take it off)
Ha, get that money come fuck with us
Hands in the sky keep on livin' do your own thing
All my people holla and let me hear you reply
Say take it off
(Take it off)
Say take it off
(You better take it off)
Say take it off
(Take it off)
Say take it off
(Better take it off)
C'mon baby c'mon, ha, we hold a rock boy
The way we on fire call a nigga hot boy
Hot, we raise the level till we blow the spot boy
And watch the water boil and spill over the pot boy
Listen, I hope you know you need to stop boy
Frontin' and tryin' be somethin' you not boy
Listen again we keep on bangin' and pissin' 'em off
Spazzin' on niggas until we silence or finish 'em off
Better tell 'em if they ain't know, I'm put 'em on Shorty
(We know how you be doin' it baby)
How we be doin' it baby?
(We know how you be takin' it off)
How we take it from 'em?
(We know how you be killin' 'em baby)
How we killin' 'em? C'mon
(We know how you be ready to ball)
You know we ready to do it
(We know how you be drivin' 'em crazy)

{Yeah, wait, wait, wait hold on come on let me put it right here

Hold on, hold on, wait, wait, wait, got a rubber?

{Wait the fuck you ain't go no pimples or nothin'
Na, na, you ain't runnin' up in here without no Jimmy

Aight so, aight so, hold on, hold on, don't yo}
{Just stay, just like that, don't even, just stay
I'm not leavin', aight cool, hold on, hold on
I knew I had a condom what the fuck man
Where the fuck is a condom when you need one?}
{It is I, Trojan Man
Oh shit, oh thank God it's you, you got a condom man?
No, I only have one trick cover left and my hormones are risin'
And I want your bitch to taste it, Trojan Man}
{This has been a paid advertisement by Flipmode and Company
And I don't give a fuck what you say 'cause I still believe
You could catch AIDS from tongue kissing a bitch
So remember always strap your shit up, Trojan Man}
