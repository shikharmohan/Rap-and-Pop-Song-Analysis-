Take it for what it's worth, my birth was a blessing
Sent to live and die on earth as a lesson
We each have a star all we have to do is find it
Once you do, everyone who sees it will be blinded
They'll tell you that you're bright, and say you have a future
When you turn your back same cats will try to shoot ya
Niggaz ain't shit, I can live on both sides of the fence
Forget what you do when you talk, see what you really meant
That's what I thought them niggaz was bluffin'
They talk all day but say, nothin'
It gets so dark, haze so intense
Since this first rain it's like it's rained ever since
Never got paid for a rhyme but I flow
Never got a plate on time but I grow
Live your life, stay on the line but I go
Went from doin' crime to bein' kind 'cause I know
I'm gonna live forever, I'm never gonna die
Only thing I fear is that I'm never gonna fly
Carry my weight but I'm never gonna cry
Shit I tell you all niggaz straight 'cause I'm never gonna lie
I'm gonna live forever, I'm never gonna die
Only thing I fear is that I'm never gonna fly
Carry my weight but I'm never gonna cry
Shit I tell you all niggaz straight 'cause I'm never gonna lie
What is about who I am that makes me unforgettable
What it is about what I've done that makes it so incredible
More money, more problems  well the fame was worse
I reached out for love and what came back was thirst
Blessed with the curse  niggaz don't hear me
Niggaz don't hear me, you all niggaz, don't hear me
What'd I just say? you see that?
You got to feel me to catch what I'm sayin', believe that
But leave that, alone
We gonna make a nigga wanna be at, your home
Oh you kinda quiet with the heat at, your dome
If the dog got he's gonna bring back a bone
'Cause we got the chrome
This is what I live for, or die for
I'm the nigga with the high score, you try for
What you niggaz wanna lie for it changes nothin'
I'm true for cats, yet some strangers bluffin'
I'm gonna live forever, I'm never gonna die
Only thing I fear is that I'm never gonna fly
Carry my weight but I'm never gonna cry
Shit I tell you all niggaz straight 'cause I'm never gonna lie
I'm gonna live forever, I'm never gonna die
Only thing I fear is that I'm never gonna fly
Carry my weight but I'm never gonna cry
Shit I tell you all niggaz straight 'cause I'm never gonna lie
Now if I take what he gave me and I, use it right
In other words if I listen and use the light
Then what I say will remain here after I'm gone
Still here, on the strength of a song, I live on
No second guessin' on what I stood for, I was good for
Stoppin' niggaz from killin' each other in the hood war
Comin' through showin' love throwin' up
The cats not throwin' love, you know whats up
Dark Man Baby, that's my name
And I got to be the realistic nigga  up in this game
'Cause ain't no shame, they don't make them like, this no more
Real to the core, big heart but built for war
I stand for what I believe in
Even if what I believe in stops me from breathin'
Relatives grievin', but I ain't went nowhere
Listen to the song I'm right there
I'm gonna live forever, I'm never gonna die
Only thing I fear is that I'm never gonna fly
Carry my weight but I'm never gonna cry
Shit I tell you all niggaz straight 'cause I'm never gonna lie
I'm gonna live forever, I'm never gonna die
Only thing I fear is that I'm never gonna fly
Carry my weight but I'm never gonna cry
Shit I tell you all niggaz straight 'cause I'm never gonna lie
