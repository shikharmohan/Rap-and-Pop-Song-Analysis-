Zim zima, who got the key to my bee ma?
Jack moves thats how we act when we team up yo yo yo yo
Yo yo yo yo yo sim sima who got the key to my beamer?
Jack mode that's how we act when we team up
Throw your triple beam up this is fish gill
I bailed out of county with counterfeit bills
My slang be high range brick city
Watch how you sniff son I'm highly octane
All you hear is bang bang bang bang
Yo remember you bitch it I forget my last name
It's all about game nothing else for delf
Walk through the woods then stomp on your foot
With high I take out any cop in the hood
Gorilla intact in this rap habitat get your step in your air max
Bounce you cocking it back but where it at
Bounce I got a six pack of Heineken
And big caps on your wheels and two laps
I gave Stella her groove back
My middle name must be fuck you

Yo yo I heard the party going on in there yeah
Well let me shake my stinking ass in there yeah
Soon as I walk in, dogs are barking
Haters play them back, I stay in front lay handicap parking
Start in arsons from jerse to arkin
Saw me coughing out that dread apartment
Roll up to the jam with the front end been up
Watch them chickens floating them getting samanila
A ghetto like D in D, fucking with D
You be on ban from TV part gree in a heart beat
Tiger straight out the cup
You light in the ass son you wave by the buck
But I'm one ninety physic
Two hundred and thirty four pound total when I'm carrying the heat
Now platinum more wax
But platinum in the streets
Any nigga that disagree smack him in the teeth
Then I bag his little piece rocking the ice
Get it to the project going to rob in the night
Why you acting like that the weed made me do it
The devils advocate ha could take days to do it
My crew do drugs Duane Reade could'nt breed
Drive me in the sun I'll amount to ten keys
Rambon I'm bonin', MC's be clonin'
That's before doc stretch up and mowning

'Cause every time I'm in my car bitches be like he ain't shit
I'll bee dat, I'll bee dat, I'll bee dat, I'll bee dat
Yo yo if you got to be a monkey be a gorilla
It's 4 a.m. I'm off a tab and steal her world rap biller
Push a big benz with the chicken head
Draws hanging from my antenna
I'll be god damned if a nigga take mine
On foot shit put roller blades on
Mind your business the nine was swiftness
I pull it stretch, it like fond of fitness
I'm a every day nigga like a Toyota
You're A and our hope you don't drope the same quarter
Rap the poop down in a hefty two
Yo he ain't from Chi, so haul ass back to Utah
