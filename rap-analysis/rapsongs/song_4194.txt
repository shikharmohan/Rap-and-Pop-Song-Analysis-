[Hook]
And this is just a mixtape, Damn
(Well it's a little more than that, It's more like a message. More like a change for the better) 
And this is just a mixtape, Damn 
(It's more of a dedication, D 3!)
And this is just a mixtape, Damn
(This what ya'll was waitin' for? DJ Drama!) 
[Chorus]
And Ima Keep Fuckin' this word til ya muthafuckas come fo' me (ya)
Don't worry if me gotta gun, you should have a gun for me (ya)
And all these niggaz is killaz and all these killaz wit me (ya)

[Mack Mane Verse]
Young veteran, soon to be OG
Plus I spit like a crack head wit no teeth
I hear you lil niggaz barkin', want more beef
You like a nigga wit no guns, you gets no piece
And when it comes to money my shit is obese
Like della reece, I need celery
Mo' money wat the f**k these niggaz tellin' me
Im young Lucifer
Take um all to hell wit, Ya
Drop um off in a fire storm 
YM riot squad get our riot on
If he testify like common see the fire bomb
If you know whats best muthaf**ka get yo quite on 
These niggaz starving out here getting they diet on
While im eatin nigga grippin on my styrofoam
One man game nigga ima die alone 
For now im wit ya girl getttin my ridey ride pipa on
[Willie The Kid Verse]
Willie the kid pull guns like a hamstring
No bull I push pro v's like Pantene
Blow like a trombone
Funny niggaz tambourine 
Playaz get jumped like a trampoline, tangerine 
Gators day, nay-sayers, mascara wearas
And my niggaz on paper getting paper like ball playaz
No blood no foul, ya my heart cold as moscow 
We NAPA killin like a hot towel 
All my hoes hostile 
Not me, never tell me not now
Rap niggaz forty cal to ya brow 
roof remover
We leave your brain with more air
Manouvre, I leave your bitch wit a moist chair
Seduce her, ya
You rappers should be tired of lyin'  
But I know its hard like a tire iron
But yet it complex like its Mayan science
Or Aztec math
Crazy as a mess tab
I feed niggaz like a mess hall
And yes y'all
Its Willie I address y'all 
Or like a stylist
Nobodies fly is this
You crazy, im getting brain like a psychiatrist 
[Chorus]
And Ima Keep f**kin this word til ya muthaf**kaz come fo' me (ya)
Don't worry if I gotta gun, you should have a gun for me
And all these niggaz is killaz and all these killaz wit me
But you should be afraid of me
[Hook 2]
Cuz Ima kill um
Ima kill um
Ya ima kill um
Yes Ima kill um
And ima kill um
Ima kill um
Ima kill ummummu
[Gudda Gudda Verse]
They say powder makes you hyper
Reefer makes you calm
Cigarettes give u cancer
well wounds make you dull
While I sip the purple harlot
Thick as my sudden drawl
Put me on the ocean floor wit a mermaid wit no draws
They got bats up in the cave
Upside down blood rushin' to they head
They reactin off a sound as I stand on the mound 
Pitchin for the crown 
Uptown bound face painted like a clown
reciting scriptures from the chapters
Proverbs leviticus 
Old ass rappers complainin what the business is 
Bout the state of hip
Soundin like some bitches hop yo ass up off a rich nigga dick
Its ridiculous the new school nigga
What you need to do is become a resident
under the condition
get yo ass up off your ass
and get your ass up on a mission
become some competition
like Federo Nadal
young money nigga we ball
like kobe or chris paul
for giving a whack cracker
still sippin cristal
wavin the lifeline
since lifes a bitch y'all
raisin up the skirts of jezzebels
for no cash like
"bitch give me that ass'
or pulling up to the lot like
"give me that jag"
no pulling up to the lot like
"give me that lam"
they study me, yeah
they cram like im a final exam
if i hit you in your back
you'll need a spinal exam
im something like a rhino or ram
animal,beast
irritating you pussies like chlamydia,yeast
YM militia you niggaz better retreat
or be like this beat
R.I.P. deceased
[Hook 2]
Cuz Ima kill um
Ima kill um
Ya ima kill um
Yes Ima kill um
And ima kill um
Ima kill um
Ima kill ummummu
[Lil Wayne Verse]
Ya already, ya better call every paul barry in ya area the ball carrier gon get popped
If I'm comin 'round the block the in swing drive gets stopped
He gon drop like a flop
On the court I love sports
That's why I play my b*tches cuz I got game
That's why you pay my b*tches (Yaay)
Same hustle no mannie
Im just hip hop they like two bunnies
who run it, b*tch nigga moi
That was French, nigga not
A kiss, nigga nah
No homo, rappers get ate like 4 on 4
They say I f**k so and so
And I be like so, so and so
Nike's on they neck, they like let me breathe
Im sorry but I cant this is how we feed
This is why we hot
This is how we freeze
To fast to follow
This is why we lead
And the money in the pocket isn't why we Gs, see
This is how we shoot and this is how we leave
ya know we tote steal, this is how we ease
You can get the steel if you try these thieves now
Glass needa Swisha let me climb these trees
And im haters say we couldn't this is why we bees
This shit like puddin', puttin' it down like gravitys pullin'
puttin' it down like gravitys pullin'
puttin' it down like gravitys pullin' me to the ground
