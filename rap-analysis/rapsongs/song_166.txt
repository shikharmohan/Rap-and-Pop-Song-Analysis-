Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Now if I give you all of me
What you gon' give me back?
Your body is callin' me
Got me feelin' like a fiend on crack
Why you gonna make me fall in love?
Now why you wanna go and do that?
Now if I give you all of me
Tell me what you gon' give me back?
Let's start with the moon and the stars, whatever you into
The money I acquire, mama, make it all simple
Flashback '03, paparazzi flashin' flicks
I moved away, hustle hard, now I got a six stash
Tell me you miss me, baby, come here and kiss me
It just happened so quickly
Feels like I hopped off a bus and got in a Bentley
It's gangsta my music, even when it's the smooth shit
You can hate me 'cause I hurt you but I ain't even do it
They predicted it all, I don't know how he knew it
He said women from Hollywood they're liar, liar, liars
You fuck 'em, they get ya heated then deny it like Mariah
Fast forward to '06, I'm still on fire
The world is still turning, my records are still earnin'
Dough come quicker and quicker, flow get sicker and sicker
Straight up and down, baby, I'ma special kinda, nigga
Now if I give you all of me
What you gon' give me back?
Your body is callin' me
Got me feelin' like a fiend on crack
Why you gonna make me fall in love?
Now why you wanna go and do that?
Now if I give you all of me, yeah
Tell me what you gon' give me back?
Oh, give it, give it, baby, baby
Give it, give it, oh baby
Give it, give it, baby, baby
Give it, give it, baby, oh baby
Life is short baby, be apart of my dreams
I ain't Ferarri horses, my Lamborghini leans
So mean, I have niggas hatin' on me
God gave me a gift, I'm supposed to be rich
I'm supposed to ride through the hood and make niggas sick
When my homies put in work, they supposed to be a hit
With a piece of chain thick, go and buy 'em some bricks
I ain't make that up, this is how it's suppose to be kid
You should feel like a life, but it gave back bad time
When I smile your smile should be as big as mine
Girl, to know me is to love me, I'm one of a kind
Even when you hate me you love me, forever your mine
Now if I give you all of me, yeah, yeah, yeah
What you gon' give me back?
Your body is callin' me, boy, yeah
Got me feelin' like a fiend on crack
Why you gonna make me fall in love?
Now why you wanna go and do that?
Now if I give you all of me
Tell me what you gon' give me back?
Hey, give it, give it, baby, baby
Give it, give it, oh baby
Give it, give it, baby, baby
Baby, baby, oh baby
What you gon' give me back?
You gonna make me fall in love
You gonna make me fall in love
What you gon' give me?
What you gon' give me?
What you gon' give me?
