3 piece wit a mink
Gotta think my shit's staying stacy Adams
Wit a Jay Crockett pad on dey cuff
On brinks
So wut da ladies wink'in
You da one in the mercedes
Shotgun wit dem things
Couch chillin watchin da lion king
Crying and thangs
'cause im wit snoop and nate
Singing rhyming and things
I'm out late 'cause im rhyming for change
I aint wit dimes for thangs
Hop back and im trying ta aim
At everythang, dat be hating my fame
Just regulatin been lacing da game
Aint no mistake in da game
2 one mother f'er dwizzle sippin on da sizzle
And dat's fo' sizzle
Fo times for da riddles 
You we is bar
Everywhere we go u noe who us are
You could tell by da car
Champagne caviar
Bubble bath 
I say i love you
And i laugh
