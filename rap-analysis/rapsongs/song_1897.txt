Auw grr, uh, you know
Ain't about being a motherfucking pimp
Ain't about being a hustler
Player thief
It's about being a motherfucking king, aight
Ya mean?
Baby it's a king thing, yeah from Kayto to David
Two kings in the streets neither one made it, uh
Think about shed a tear ? Niggah save it, what
Dirty motherfucking games, both niggas played it, come on
David went on some foul shit, went full throttle, throttle
Smack shorty in the face with a glass bottle
Killing bitches with battery acid, yeah
That's the type of shit this nigga mastered, yeah
David was a bastard
Step out the stunts with the slow walkin'
Glide by leave you straight no talkin'
It's about were ever I'm at, knowing I got them aight
By the time a nigga thought about beating I shot 'em
See it takes a snake to spot a snake
And by the time they spot the snake, god shot the snake
I got to get what ever I can get my hands on
Fuck you niggas, what is what I'ma stand on
It's a king thing, what goes around comes back around
It's a king thing, every part of town knows why your down
It's a king thing, got these new cats comin' up in the game
It's a king thing and I'ma make sure niggas remember my name for real
It ain't about talkin' the talk, just walkin' the walk
How many cats you don't cross from L.A. to New York
Hit regardless for what when ever you hit town, aight
You got real niggas respecting on how you get down
Ain't no motherfucking thing changed whoo
I'm still the grimiest nigga up in this game
What's my name, what
King D A V I D, I'm like a bloodhound
'Cuz it ain't nothin' but money hide it from me
And ain't nobody ridin' for free fuck that, what
Excuse my back nigga, what black, yeah
I go at niggas hard for a little bit of pay
A couple of hundred dollars will get your ass dead
I'm not petty I stay hungry
And as long as shit is the way it is, then shit go stay ugly
Bitch, so bring home the drama, yeah
Shit how petty niggas cross, I gotta sleep with the armor
It's a king thing, what goes around comes back around
It's a king thing, every part of town knows why your down
It's a king thing, got these new cats comin' up in the game
It's a king thing and I'ma make sure niggas remember my name for real
But I'ma make sure niggas remember my name for real
It's a king thing, yeah, what goes around comes back around
It's a king thing, every part of town knows why your down
It's a king thing, got these new cats comin' up in the game
It's a king thing and I'ma make sure niggas remember my name for real
