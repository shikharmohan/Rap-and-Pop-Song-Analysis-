Hush baby, wanna let ya know
This is how it's gonna go
Hush baby, wanna let ya know this is how it's gonna go
If you wanna come and play gotta do it my way, my way, my way
Hush baby, don't talk so much, just wanna feel ya touch
Everything will be okay, if you do it my way, my way, my way, hush
You feel so good, rest of my life I wish I could
Hold you tight and take a flight out the hood
Was I foul or just misunderstood?
Mild-mannered or up to no-good
It really doesn't matter, either way I should
Maximize the moment and hold you close
Jump in the drop spider and cruise down the coast
Who loved you the most? I was never ghost
When lives was on the line confusion in ya mind
Runnin' outta time drama of all kind
But there's faith in our mind we spiritually inclined
Sometimes I flip, sometimes you flip
Sometimes we wild out and act like lunatics
We movin' too fast, the whole world's in a rush
Everybody just hush
Hush baby, wanna let ya know this is how it's gonna go
If you wanna come and play gotta do it my way, my way, my way
Hush baby, don't talk so much, just wanna feel ya touch
Everything will be okay, if you do it my way, my way, my way, hush
It's all a test, the pain, the drama the villa in the Bahamas
The highs, the lows, the hoop-d, the Rolls
The money flowin' certain doors that we go in
The people we meet, the hands that we shake
Whether it's Mortans or sizzla steak
But everything will be okay
If we do it my way, my way, my way
'Cuz I believe in romance kissin' while ya slow dance
Me bouncin' baby, no chance no matter the circumstance
Whatever it takes girl, I'll swim to France
'Cuz ya beauty's unmatched such a great catch
Unconditional love, forever we are attached
Deal with the drama, we can find our way back
With or without the Maybach
Hush baby, wanna let ya know this is how it's gonna go
If you wanna come and play gotta do it my way, my way, my way
Hush baby, don't talk so much, just wanna feel ya touch
Everything will be okay, if you do it my way, my way, my way, hush
I can feel ya pain
Like we simese twins connected by our brains
Walkin' through the desert in the ice cold rain
Wit you in my life ain't nothing's gonna change
God willin', we still be doin' our thang
When my six-pack's faded and rap is outdated
But thats many years from now so don't rush
Little mama just hush
Hush baby, wanna let ya know this is how it's gonna go
If you wanna come and play gotta do it my way, my way, my way
Hush baby, don't talk so much, just wanna feel ya touch
Everything will be okay, if you do it my way, my way, my way
Hush baby hush hush darling
Hush baby hush hush, don't talk so much
Don't talk so much, wanna feel ya touch
Hush baby hush
Hush baby hush
Hush baby wanna let ya know
