Now me i'm the life of the party
A little bit of juice little bit of the gin
A little bit of Mo et play bottles of the Rose
Feel a little buzz then i'm gettin' it in..
Now me I get it in, I get it in..
Me i get it in, I get it in..
Now me I get it in, I get it in..
Me i get it in, I get it in..
Verse
Look as soon as i step in the club i swear my nigga you can feel the attention shift
Started around twelve ended up around two i better leave with more hoes than i came here with
I can't be responsible for what i say or i do when i talk intoxicated
Shorty say i told her i love her i put her out the next mornin' sayin' bitch i must have been faded
I don't know what you heard about me but the word about me that i'm no trick i'm no sucker i'm no chump
I be in the VIP with my niggaz 'round me sayin' y'all can have whatever you want..
Chorus
Me i get it in
Sunday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
That's Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday we get it in..
I need a drink, give me a drink
I need a drink, shawty give me a drink
I need a drink, give me a drink
I need a drink, shawty give me a drink
Verse
I hate to say i told you so, but i told you so, i go hard when it's time to play
Shorty get to droppin' it low, like the dancers do, in the Go-Go in front of me
She know i like to see her dance she get to breakin' it down we get the bouncin' outta control
Because i got a hell of a flow we got paper to blow my whole clique pop bottles galore
It's no secret the hood done peeped it when we come through son we look like bread
My '89 grind make my old nine shine like we been movin' bricks 'round this bitch for years
I say i get it in it's because i get it in, now shorty there a eight but her friend near a ten
I finna spend my G she fuck with me i'm into win, i'm cooler than her ma then we do this shit again
Chorus
Me i get it in
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
That's Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday we get it in
I need a drink, give me a drink
I need a drink, shawty give me a drink
I need a drink, give me a drink
I need a drink, shawty give me a drink
