[intro: jay-z]
Whut the fuck? 
Niggaz, y'all ready for this
Bitches, y'all ready for this
Ha, alright. let's bounce
[verse 1: jah rule]
I'm startin' to flow
You know,
That's what niggaz wit do do, yo
Red means stop, green means go
Right now I see green
You wanna stop
Oh no
What are you anyway nigga, friend or foe
Don't fuck wit me, or i-n-c
Nigga, what the fuck, are you crazy
Can't believe dat shit, tryin' act swayze
You'd be better off lazy
So shut the fuck up right now, and maybe
Murder i-n-c will show mercy
'cause first b
We don't fuck wit' dem, uninterested niggaz
You know who I'm talkin about
Those niggaz that started to bust out
Soon as our first joint came out
Holla holla, if I could have a dolla
For every nigga that hated me soon as i-n-c was on blaze
But I don't give a fuck
I said not a flying fuck
Ja rule, murder i-n-c, make ya say whut whut
[hook: jay-z, ja rule, and dmx]
The murder i-n-c
Yeah nigga
Just you and me
Fuck around
Catch bullet from me
Cause there ain't no fuckin' around
Whenever the i-n-c is in town [3x]
[verse 2: dmx]
(dog growling, then barking)
D-m-x, my dogs gonna bite you
Gonna fuck you up, just cause they like to
How the fuck you gonna fuck around wit' organized crime
God damn, we live what we speak in every fuckin' rhyme
Yo, ja (what the deal, x? )
Here's a twenty, go get me a fuckin' dime
Now, back to this murder shit
Light my fuse, my teeth begin to grit
Party wit' my crew, fuck you
You ain't playin' wit no screw, or a smack
Cause when I attack, I never take back
Anything bad I do or say, cause yo that shit is wack
And I just luv when you niggaz bring your whole crew
It's just sme more beef to stick you to
And fuck you, now it's plain to see,
It ain't to smart fuckin' wit' murder i-n-c
[hook:]
[verse 3: jay-z]
Dem niggaz ain't prepared
For dis shit we prepared
Got every nigga scared
Cause of all the fuckin' shit that we shared
And don't none of them niggaz
Wanna fuck around
We're never gonna find a common ground
Many niggaz wanna know, does murder sound like this
We're three hip-hop philanthrapists
But, we don't give no muney, we don't give a fuck so...
When the light is green
It's time to go
I don't care who you know
You still payin' full price, to our show
Fuck no, I won't give 'em to you free or with a discount yo
'cause
You ain't gettin' nada from us
Cause niggaz always get a lotta money from us
That ain't the thug way
Nigga, don't try and play
Hold the fuck up, are you gay
No
Well anyway
It's time to say
Final goodbyes
And one more thing, this shit I just rapped about
And none of it are lies
Next step is to come in, fuck your boo
When I'm through
All she'll be able to say is jigga whut jigga who
And ask her who her man is
She'll tell you
She'll put her finga on the trigga
Pull and yell jigga my nigga
