[Chorus]:
When I was young we only had fun hit the club it was fun
(We used to love to be the life of the party, but then we always got to fightin' and arguin', and had to get it poppin' right at the party) I used to say "G" can't you niggas stay "G" then I had to see the reala'
(Well He just wanna be the life of the party, he probably bustin' out the sprite n' bacardi, and he don't wanna lose his life at the party)
[Verse 1]:T.I.
I used to love to get clean roll fresh to the scene pocket full of green, neck full of bling bling make the bitches loud scream, pannies all clean, now here come the wild niggas talkin' loud on the bean, Listen buddy you way to close to me where I'm from that means you wanna do somethin' to me so don't be loud talkin to me like you some bully it's a rocket in my pocket and you through if I pull it, but honestly I'd rather save my bullet this could be somethin' we could both avoid now could it, I'll listen to you tell me what's ya name and what ya hood is but I got my girl with' me, get in the club with me? Naw ya see dog I know we all somebody but what make you think that you could ask to call somebody? Nigga I don't know you, you see the shit I go through n' this a party dog I don't even wanna go to
