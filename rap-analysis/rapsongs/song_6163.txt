Red's Gone Wild
Gilla, Gilla, Gilla, Gilla niggaz
Gilla, Gilla niggaz
Yo, I'm hot, global warmin' ridin' on 26
I ain't thug nigga I don't, bullet proof shit
Gilla nigga and we abide by the blueprint
We ain't all loud, holla and whoopin'
Blah, blah, blah, a whole lotta nuttin'
You know the loud ones, they do a whole lot of duckin'
I stay on the grind, my hustle real heavy
And even for that cake, I'll fuck Lil' Debbie
Soldier boy, murder land's like Baltimore
Roll on stage, more deeper than a Commodore
Get shut down, yeah, knock your mans off
Wouldn't trade places if you [Incomprehensible] or Randolph
Shorty, shorty, give me that body
Start a riot 'til security on the walkie
Reggie Noble '07, keep all sort of hoes yellin'
Nine, four, three, eleven, get it or forget it
You could hold this blaow
(Real street, real street niggaz ain't havin' that shit)
You could hold this blaow
(Real street, real street niggaz ain't havin' that shit)
You could hold this blaow
(Real street, real street niggaz ain't havin' that shit)
You could hold this blaow
(And niggaz is, nig' and niggaz is gettin' smoked G)
You could hold this blaow
  (Believe me)

Yo, Gilla nigga era, fuck you, pay me
Boogie down like Bronx, high at the skate key
It's like Janet, 'What Have You Done For Me, Lately'?
Nuttin', I blew up, you try to inflate me
Dawg, in my dutch, a whole lotta bud
End up in Jersey now, a whole lotta blood
So when you get here, show a whole lotta love
Or leave shot up, robbed and thrown out a shrub
I don't condone, I got kids to relate to
'Redman Gone Wild', hear the new debut
Fox fired a nigga, boy that's great news
Now I'm back in the hood like Grey Goose
Who's gona stop me? I'm razor sharp
With Gilla niggaz frontline and Jay the boss
Y'all chicken ass niggaz blood made of broth
But I'm barbershop talk, L.A. and New York
So all you West Coast niggaz, get that money
'Cause these Brick City dudes get that money
It's gonna be one pussy that'll act funny
Yo, I'm gonna get this nigga, leave the Cadillac runnin'
Yo, Uptown got haze, Miami got crippy
I'm fucked up, I slipped my own self a Mickie
Doin' dirty, I'm 'XXX' like Vin Dies'
Who you know can pump weed out of Wendy's
Shorty, shorty, give me that body
Start a riot 'til security on the walkie
Reggie Noble '07, keep all sort of hoes yellin'
Nine, four, three, eleven, get it or forget it
You could hold this blaow
(Real street, real street niggaz ain't havin' that shit)
You could hold this blaow
(Real street, real street niggaz ain't havin' that shit)
You could hold this blaow
(Real street, real street niggaz ain't havin' that shit)
You could hold this blaow
(And niggaz is, nig' and niggaz is gettin' smoked G)
You could hold this blaow
  (Believe me)
Gilla, Gilla, Gilla, Gilla
Yeah, Gilla niggaz
Gilla, Gilla, Gilla, Gilla
Thorough niggaz, monkey niggaz
