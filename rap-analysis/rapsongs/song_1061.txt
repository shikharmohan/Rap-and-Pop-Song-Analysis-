What do you see when look at me and I'm just standing there?
Shit, that make the world all work, that's what in my blood
And I won't stop until I drop 'cause my life's just burning out
So walk, keep climbing, won't look down until I reach the top
What a world, what a world
What a world, what a world
What a world, what a world
What a world, what a world
A little boy from Chicago had dreams to be a star
And make a way and get some pay and drive a fancy car
Though his mama used to say to him, "Hey boy, just go school"
But whether it was old or new in school he broke the rules
What do you see when look at me and I'm just standing there?
Shit, that make the world all work, that's what in my blood
And I won't stop until I drop 'cause my life's just burning out
So walk, keep climbing, won't look down until I reach the top
What a world, what a world
What a world, what a world
What a world, what a world
What a world, what a world
Now his whole life he told his boys, "Hey y'all, I'm going to rap"
So when he got a rap contract, it wasn't no turning back
Now his mama she would say to him
"You need to get, get back in school"
And all the trash that the peoples say he was using it for fuel
What do you see when look at me and I'm just standing there?
Shit, that make the world all work, that's what in my blood
And I won't stop until I drop 'cause my life's just burning out
So walk, keep climbing, won't look down until I reach the top
What a world, what a world
What a world, what a world
What a world, what a world
What a world, what a world
And the story goes on and on, it goes on and on and on
They say, "Hey boy, you rap real good but ain't making no hit songs"
So he'd tell himself, yo, yo, yo self you gotta do it the way you do
And make this music from your soul and make it fresh and new
What do you see when look at me and I'm just standing there?
Shit, that make the world all work, that's what in my blood
And I won't stop until I drop 'cause my life's just burning out
So walk, keep climbing, won't look down until I reach the top
What a world, what a world
What a world, what a world
What a world, what a world
What a world, what a world
Then the game, it started to change
They say music just ain't the same
Though he remained the song he is sang
Just keep your drive, stay in your lane
Inch by inch the people came
They started to know his name and say you do your thang
Now the whole, whole world singing his song
From Chicago a star it born, wow
What do you see when look at me and I'm just standing there?
Shit, that make the world all work, that's what in my blood
And I won't stop until I drop 'cause my life's just burning out
So walk, keep climbing, won't look down until I reach the top
What a world, what a world
What a world, what a world
What a world, what a world
What a world, what a world
