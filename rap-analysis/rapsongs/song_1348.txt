I am quick to pull the trigger, quick to pull your card
Hard late for the boulevard
It's Da B to the R A T with the bump
Sendin' good vibrations from the trunk to the front of your ride
Where I live that's what they like
So that's what I give
Somethin' for them fools when they crawl and creep
And creep and crawl it's fa all y'all, well
Who's that makin' that funky noise?
It's Da Brat-tat-tat-tat bustin' out on that ass
Fa all y'all, fa all y'all, hey hey hey,
You don't hear me, though
Who's that makin that funky noise?
It's like that, it's like that, it's Da Brat
Fa all y'all, fa all y'all, hey hey
Now that Da Brat's in the house yo the house is packed
Guys and girls everywhere with a hump in they back
As I sling my funk like a vodoo moose through the hood
All fa y'all, 'cause everythin' is good now
Lay back listen to the phattest
Listen to the baddest rhymin' apparatus
At a status you ain't got to check
'Cause y'all knows that I definitely gets wrecked, so, uh
Who's that makin' that funky noise?
It's Da Brat-tat-tat-tat bustin' out on that ass
Fa all y'all, fa all y'all, hey hey hey
Who's that makin that funky noise?
It's like that, it's like that, it's Da Brat
Fa all y'all, fa all y'all, hey hey
Gotta give thanks to the funk when it's time to pray
With some fine ass dank now it's time to play
That shit from that ghetto ass bitch me be
B to the R A to the T
Just niggas and bitches on every side
Waitin' for the chance to get funkdafied
And all they gotta do is learn the words of this anthem
I'll grant them if you can chant them like everybody else
Who's that makin' that funky noise?
It's Da Brat-tat-tat-tat bustin' out on that ass
Fa all y'all, fa all y'all, hey hey hey
You don't hear me, though
Who's that makin that funky noise?
It's like that, it's like that, it's Da Brat
Fa all y'all, fa all y'all, hey hey
I promise to funk the whole funk
Nothin' but the funk
I promise to funk the whole funk
Nothin' but the funk
