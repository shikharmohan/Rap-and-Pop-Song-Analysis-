Things just ain't the same for gangsters
Times is changing, young niggas is aging
Becoming old Gs in the game and changing
To make way for these new names and faces but
The strangest things can happen from rappin when
Niggas get wrapped up in image and actin'
Niggas get capped up and wrapped in plastic
Zipped up in bags when it happens, that's it
I've seen them come, I've watched them go
Watched them rise, witnessed it and watched them blow
Watched them all pass and then watched them grow
Watched the lawsuits when they lost the dough
Best friends and money, I lost them both
Went, visited niggas in the hospital
It's all the same shit all across the globe
I just sit back and watch the show
(The watcher)
Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as before
  (The watcher)
People I used to know
Just don't know me no more
  (The watcher)
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know
  (The watcher)
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low
(I watch)
I moved out of the hood for good, you blame me?
Niggas ain't made me if niggas they can't be
But niggas can't hit niggas they can't see
I'm out of sight, now I'm out of their dang reach
How would you feel if niggas wanted you killed?
You'd probably move to a new house on a new hill
And choose a new spot if niggas wanted you shot
I ain't a thug, how much Tupac in you, you got
I ain't no bitch neither, it's either my life or your life
And I ain't leaving, I like breathing
'Cause nigga we can go round for round
Clip for clip, shit, for pound for pound
Nigga if you really want to take it there we can
Just remember that you fuckin' with a family man
I got a lot more to lose than you, remember that
When you wanna come and fill these shoes
(The watcher)
Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as before
  (The watcher)
People I used to know
Just don't know me no more
  (The watcher)
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know
  (The watcher)
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low
(I watch)
Things just ain't the same for gangsters
Cops is anxious to put niggas in handcuffs
They wanna hang us, see us dead and enslave us
Keep us trapped in the same place we're raised in
Then they wonder why we act so outrageous
Run around stressed out and pull out gauges
'Cause every time you let the animal out cages
It's dangerous to people who look like strangers
But now we got a new era of gangsters
Hustlers and youngsters livin' amongst us
Lookin at us, now callin' us busters
Can't help but reminisce back when it was us
Nigga we started this gangsta shit
And this the motherfuckin' thanks I get?
It's funny how time flies
I'm just havin fun, just watchin it fly by
(The watcher)
Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as before
  (The watcher)
People I used to know
Just don't know me no more
  (The watcher)
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know
  (The watcher)
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low
(I watch)
The watcher
I watch
