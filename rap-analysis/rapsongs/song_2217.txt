I pledge allegiance to the ghetto
I pledge allegiance to the game
I pledge allegiance to the money and the cars
And the pussy and the bitches and the fame
I pledge allegiance to the ghetto
I pledge allegiance to the game
I pledge allegiance to the money and the cars
And the pussy and the bitches and the fame, beeyatch
To all my, to all my hoodlums & my thugz with their mugs on
Up in the ghetto and the hood with the platex rubber gloves on
In the kitchen cookin' chicken, diamonds, hop and gab
Droppin' off packages and grindin' outta taxicabs
Throw it up, throw it up, throw it up, ugh
Throw it up, nigga, throw it up, throw it up
Throw it up, throw it up, throw it up
Throw it up, nigga, throw it up, throw it up
Fuck talkin', I'm chalkin' niggas, best ta get ta walkin'
It's the shadiest, Charlie Hustle and my nigga the chicken hawk in on
That throw it up ,throw it up, dip as I dips, skip with the Euro clip
Hangin' for chips on 100-spoke whips
All I know is pussy, money and color bandannas
And tryin' to get my kids some more chickens than colonel sanders
Play us by the trigger so I'ma live by the trigger
And rivals, seven bitches for all my hoodlum and thug niggas
[Incomp.] regulations in the game, never snitch
Never sang soprano, wild gravy, bustin' kilograms, goin' platinum
Door and panel, never dustin' up, never crackin' under pressure
Seems to me I do my time and I get out whenever
Early people say I smell like glocks, what kind of car you got?
I tell 'em "Brooklyn cotch", Johnnie walker, snapple lemon-squeezed
And scotch is what I drink a nigga up under the table
While all you powder puff niggas take all my votes
To all my, to all my hoodlums & my thugz with their mugs on
Up in the ghetto and the hood with the platex rubber gloves on
In the kitchen cookin' chicken, diamonds, hop and gab
Droppin' off packages and grindin' outta taxicabs
Throw it up, throw it up, throw it up, ugh
Throw it up, nigga, throw it up, throw it up
Throw it up, throw it up, throw it up, nigga
Throw it up, nigga, throw it up, throw it up
Well, it's that old Inglewood gang bang, hustlin' ass nigga
That dope game, flossin' ho, bustin' ass nigga
Still grindin' while rhymin' now up to seven figures
Low-down, duct tapin', 2-11 lick hitter
Bangin' sendin' birds outta town on the bus
If ya in to sellin' crack, nigga fuck with us
I got cars and a mansion with wine in the cellar
And a bitch on my team that'll kill when I tell her
Back with ninjas so ya know
I do this for folsom and Susanville, fo' sho'
My niggas in Quentin and Vacaville, before I
From Chino to Tracey to hatched by to Rikers Island
Pelican Bay solid, dat long park and terminal island
Keep on smilin', dialin' and callin' connect
'Cos you're my focus, you know, I'm accept
A za, a zap board, deuce amps
Shoot dice with, to all my stamps beeyatch
To all my, to all my hoodlums & my thugz with their mugs on
Up in the ghetto and the hood with the platex rubber gloves on
In the kitchen cookin' chicken, diamonds, hop and gab
Droppin' off packages and grindin' outta taxicabs
Throw it up, throw it up, throw it up, ugh
Throw it up, nigga, throw it up, throw it up
Throw it up, throw it up, throw it up
Throw it up, nigga, throw it up, throw it up
Could it be me or was it this chronic or bombay?
That got me puttin' it down for all my hoodlums around the way
Lex spares, money dippin', bullet-proof vests and sack warriors
All my street niggas, east to the west to the souths, I can't hearin' ya
If it ain't Charlie Hustle, it's that nigga mack Manson
While the g homies boogie, we keep they hoes dancin'
And we stay lexed up wit the parlay features
Sportin' beamed-up chucks wit the flamed-up creases
I represent the flat lands, the alley ways, the moms and pops
The Chinese, the AK, the fiend, the rocks
The liquor store on every corner, the laundromat
The quick to run up on the nigga to peel my cap
To all my, to all my hoodlums & my thugz with their mugs on
Up in the ghetto and the hood with the platex rubber gloves on
In the kitchen cookin' chicken, diamonds, hop and gab
Droppin' off packages and grindin' outta taxicabs
Throw it up, throw it up, throw it up, ugh
Throw it up, nigga, throw it up, throw it up
Throw it up, throw it up, throw it up
Throw it up, nigga, throw it up, throw it up
A dollar bill y'all, a dollar bill y'all
A getcha, a getcha, a getcha scrill y'all
A dollar bill y'all, a dollar bill y'all
A getcha, a getcha, a getcha scrill y'all
A getcha scrill y'all, a dollar bill y'all
A dollar, a dollar, a dollar bill y'all
A dollar bill y'all, a dollar bill y'all
A dollar, a dollar, a getcha scrill y'all
