The-Dream (Chorus)
There's no mercy on me
No crying myself to sleep
No mercy on me
Nightmares have become my dreams
No mercy for me
Good morning reality
Will I wake we'll never know
I'm late for my date with destiny
Let me go
Let me go
You've got to let me go
Right or wrong
Let me go
I'm on my path
Let me go
T.I (Verse 1)
My mama loved me more than i do
She said you pap was jus like you
Trapped in a vicious circle
Jesus youngest disciple
Tell the judge if he throwed the book at me
Make it the bible
Start calling myself the king
For lack of a better title
Loyal beyond belief to my detriment
It's so vital I change or blow opportunities
Like a choir recital
Now while I do not care who telling
Meanwhile selling powder puts food in the bellies
Well it's unfortunate
The orphanage couldn't keep up the mortgages
Kid go to school stupid they teachers ignoring it
Sorta just doomed, forced into being a goon, selling kush in a jar
Mixing up (guitar?) in a balloon
Consumed with the same way of life i left
Everything I know now learned by myself
All you see are the whips
The Maseratis Ferraris
So they don't sympathise 
Don't nobody feel sorry
No mercy
[Chorus]
There's no mercy on me
No crying myself to sleep
No mercy on me
Nightmares have become my dreams
No mercy for me
Good morning reality
Will I wake we'll never know
I'm late for my date with destiny
Let me go
Let me go
You've got to let me go
Right or wrong
Let me go
I'm on my path
Let me go
[Verse] T.I
Everybody's standing and waiting an they're hating
Gospels say they should forgive me
They'd rather hand me to satan
Blatant displays the day of hypocrisy
Boy you got to be kidding
Could it be possibly the second coming of Pac is me?
Remember That
When he was here
And when he died you realised you need him here
God with me partner
Ain't no one for me to fear
Hindsight 20/20
Future not as clear
But I'm a rider till i die
Put bullets 'tween my eye
I just ask that I can make my peace with god and say goodbye
Forgot the world like lady Di
Hone the day he died
His wife and sons and daughters know that every day he tried
To be a person nah they wanted better verses 
They could market to the merchants
But when they closed curtains
You could be for certain ain't nobody perfect
But when you're rich nobody gives a shit
No Mercy
[Chorus]
There's no mercy on me
No crying myself to sleep
No mercy on me
Nightmares have become my dreams
No mercy for me
Good morning reality
Will I wake we'll never know
I'm late for my date with destiny
Let me go
You've got to let me go
Let me go
Let me go
Let me go
