I was chillin' right around my way
21st Eastside at a beach
This lil' fool ran up on me
Poppin' off wit his homies like he was a straight G
Askin' where I'm from while he runnin' up
Bang my sound, nag one of them
Some things, son, they just don't change
Fools don't respect nothin' but to *** bang
What's seen is what's saw, Dogg is the law
I have you suckers runnin' like a marathon
Lil G's tryna creep on the East wit it
Talkin' 'bout they gon' get my chain
And they gon' leave with it
But they don't know, once they get close
That's tic tac toe, 3 lil' G's laid on the floor
Yeah, this happened yesterday
On the West, they spray, I heard an ese say, he said
Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw these pack o' guys and they act real hard
And what they do?
They twisted fingers, say, "You know who we are"
He said, "I don't give a ***, I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg"
They keep talkin' and it went too far
So Snoopy, he went straight to the trunk of his car
And what he get?
He got his *** and they start runnin' hard
He started firin' and then he just charged
Plaow, run, run, plaow, duck, duck
Plaow, run, run, plaow, run, run
Plaow, run, run, plaow, duck, duck
Plaow, run, run, plaow, run, run
I didn't mean to hit what I hit
Now that's 3 wannabes dead and I ain't seen s***
And these suckers'll scream for plea
But for like a G like me, it's just a case
Whether you could see
I crack the mac back and pop off rollin'
And snap your neck back, you chop off fallin'
I haven't seen my mama in a week
And she ain't even ran her mouth about me
Bump that, I ain't give a f*** about the law
Say they wanna brawl
You would think that they wore bra's
Believe in all the things that you never saw
In it, y'all, been a Dogg, smoke you like a Menathol
You think you know? But this can't go
You think you'll blow all my dough?
What the f***? No
See these suckers proceed to speed
So feel the need to bleed
All you hear my enemies goin'
Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw these pack o' guys and they act real hard
And what they do?
They twisted fingers, say, "You know who we are"
He said, "I don't give a ***, I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg"
They keep talkin' and it went too far
So Snoopy, he went straight to the trunk of his car
And what he get?
He got his *** and they start runnin' hard
He started firin' and then he just charged
Plaow, run, run, plaow, duck, duck
Plaow, run, run, plaow, run, run
Plaow, run, run, plaow, duck, duck
Plaow, run, run, plaow, run, run
I wouldn't be the G that I am
If I didn't pop suckers in their mouth
I'll be damned
If Snoop'll keep one foot on the streets
And leave them cover in sheets
Run wit the homies wit the heat
You never seen a thug like this
You never seen a dub like me
And I ain't weak for wantin' peace
In fact, I could be beast of the East, you lil' buster
I never hesitate to blaze
Look, I'm really tryna change my ways
I gotta move my team 'cuz my people's are screamin'
That, "We need more for fun or is it legal?"
[Incomprehensible]
On this song, make it feel like a drive-by
It's a shame but somebody gotta die
They say it happens state to state
But when I'm mobbin' L.A.
All I hear the eses say, they go
Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw these pack o' guys and they act real hard
And what they do?
They twisted fingers, say, "You know who we are"
He said, "I don't give a ***, I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg"
They keep talkin' and it went too far
So Snoopy, he went straight to the trunk of his car
And what he get?
He got his *** and they start runnin' hard
He started firin' and then he just charged
Plaow, run, run, plaow, duck, duck
Plaow, run, run, plaow, run, run
Plaow, run, run, plaow, duck, duck
Plaow, run, run, plaow, run, run
Snoop Dogg, him bust
Skateboard P, they say him bust
DPG, them bust
BBC, you know them bust
Come again now
Snoop Dogg, him bust
Skateboard P, you know him bust
Come again now, BBC, them bust
DPGC, you know them bust
Come again now
