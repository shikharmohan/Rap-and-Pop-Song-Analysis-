Yeah, come on, come on, come on
This is my family, this is my family, my family
Mo Thug music, Mo Thug music
Sing, sing, sing, sing along, sing along
It's all about, Mo Thug, Mo Thug, Mo Thug
(Sing along, sing along)
Mo Thug, Mo Thug, Mo Thug, Mo Thug, Mo Thug
(Sing, sing, sing, sing along, sing along)
Mo Thug, Mo Thug, Mo Thug, Mo Thug
My family, oh, it means so much to me, everywhere we go
Playa haters gonna hate and that's for sure
My family tree recruited on this Thugsta groove
Whatcha gonna do when they come for you?
I love my family, this Mo Thug family, you mean the world to me
Heaven's where we gonna be together, together we stand
Together we fall, ya'll, I never turn my back on y'all
I got my halo, cocked [unverifed] drop [unverifed] fall, ya'll
Come and look at this world, that's ever so cruel,
But the good Lord blessed us, gave me true family
I can depend on, 500 Benz with the [unverifed] chrome rims on
Now I can get off when the wind blow
But I'd like to thank You, Jesus Christ, for givin' for
Givin' up your life for us now, I can think twice, 'fore roll the dice
Advice from a thug, tell mommy, I love her, everyday think of her
Take a look at your thugs to the front of the line
Hear the thunder grind off in my mind, we done partied overtime
Destruction, terror, oh what an era, let's get it together 'fore it's over
Be a soldiers like my Mo Thug family
They never ever turned their backs on me
(Backs on me)
When I was down, My Mo Thugs is always around
And if there comes a time to pick or choose
(Pick or choose)
My Mo Thugs won't never lose
(Don't ya know yo?)
