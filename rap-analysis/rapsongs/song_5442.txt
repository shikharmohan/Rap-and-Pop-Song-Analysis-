I'm the best
And that's B
And that's capital
I hang low like testicles
MCs wanna copy these ....... flows
Hoes, better back up b'fore
they get slapped up
Pack up and go tell mommy
That I racked up you
You you you and your whole crew
wacha wacha wacha wacha go'n do (ugh)
wacha wacha go'n do
To me   The M I double S Y E
Wanna bat to me
It's gonna be some tragedies
Ummm, what's your name
Coz you got game you wanna know
What it be like, where the deal is,
Where my man at, can you get with me,
You say you got the things that I need.  (I need)
What's your name
Coz you got game you wanna know
Who I roll with, who I be with,
Who I'm down with,
Do I like to do, the nasty things that you do
Chorus:
Relieve some tension
Break for
Break for in a mission
When me and you
You start da kissing
You'll see, what you been missing
Relieve some, some of your tension
Break for
Break for in a mission
When me and you
You start da kissing
You'll see, what you been missing
Ummm, you're so fine
I wanna make you mine
I wanna know
Can I be wid you, can you be with me,
One the count of three, me and you,
We go'n get romantically
You're so fine

I wanna know
Do you got a girl, is she good to you
I bet she won't do the things, that I'll do to you
Chorus
I be creepin and creepin
With my peoples my peoples
Wid my homies my homies
We be smoking that reefa
Tryna get  (release some tension)   high
Tryna get  (release some tension)   high
So I hit um
Wid da boogie bang  pop pop
Turn me up a notch
The neighbours wanna call the cops
They can't stand to see me rock
Every houses on the block
Nigga knock, don't stop
Chorus till fade
