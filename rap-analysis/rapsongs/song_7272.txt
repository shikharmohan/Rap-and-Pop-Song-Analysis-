Our Father who are in Heaven, Hollowed be Thy name
Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven
Give us this day, our daily bread and forgive us for our trespasses
As we forgive those who trespass against us
Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil
For Thine is the Kingdom, the power and the glory for ever and ever
Amen
Man, I'm praying for help while I'm lookin' at the life I left
It's kinda hard not to hate myself but quiet is kept
Right or wrong it's just the way I felt, I might be better
Of praying for death on my knees I knelt, still trying
To find a way to accept it ain't a way
I can help nobody till I save myself
Technically I'm still a slave myself
I gotta climb out the grave myself, man I played myself
But when I look at all the fans I touched
I ask how can a man that's done so much be treated so unjust
'Cause I'm tryin' to inspire the folks wanna condemn
'Cause they sell dope, well man show 'em the ropes
Be a father, a football coach, a role model or a symbol of hope
Take another approach instead of testifying against 'em in court
Handcuffin' 'em and closin' the door, so they can be worse than before
Can't you see they only do what they know?
Then you wonder why they don't care no more
Life ain't fair I know but why I'm hated everywhere I go
Next time you wanna compare my flow just know
(I'm praying for help)
Askin' somebody else to give me a hand
I'm tryin' hard but I'm only a man, man
(I'm praying for help)
Hopin' somebody else can see what I see
It's like the hood only matter to me they got me
(Praying for help)
Hopin' somebody else can carry the torch
I'm all alone with no kinda support
(While I was praying for help)
Realized I don't need nobody else
If God with me I can do it myself
(Tired of just praying for help)
I know it's only one King, one thing, one being
Only something I believe without seein' and with all my faith
I pray somehow, someway regardless of what anyone say
I believe one day that I'ma change my life, get right
Start livin' like Christ
Till the end of my fight, I'ma be defending my strife
Till somebody come and shut off my lights
I ain't never gone quit, no matter how difficult is gone get
And you can bet whatever on this, I'm forever gone spit
Harder than niggaz hatin' on TIP
You can take the weight and place it on TIP
I'll double my load carry it as the trouble unfolds
Hold yours and I bet I don't fold, put that on my soul
If it takes till I'm 100 years old
Bet I'm reachin' every one of my goals
(You know I'm praying for help)
Askin' somebody else to give me a hand
I'm tryin' hard but I'm only a man, man
(I'm praying for help)
Hopin' somebody else can see what I see
It's like the hood only matter to me they got me
(Praying for help)
Hopin' somebody else can carry the torch
I'm all alone with no kinda support
(While I was praying for help)
Realized I don't need nobody else
If God with me I can do it myself
(Tired of just praying for help)
So many times I done wish that I could change my mind
Change my life and leave the game behind
And it's been so many days, I done prayed I could find a way
Find the heart and the time to say only so many are blessed with
So many chances, so many checks, so many fans with
Ao many arrests and it's been so many deaths
So many prisons with niggaz in there
And the system keep playin' them to the left
Man it's so many test so many haters love seein' you stress
But tribulations come with being the best
Still there's so many reflects, singin' bout Tecs
Winnin', green and the trickz?
Sellin' dreams that never seen in the jex?
That's why I'm seen as a threat
So many stripes off the streets in my vest
So many rappers get so little respect
Man niggaz faith on the shelf
'Cause of the cards that a nigga was dealt
Or the hard that a nigga done dealt
So many niggaz that left out of the hood
Made a way for they self
Instead of givin' back they stay for they self
So many playin' they self
Instead of reading educating they selves
The ones who won't pray for they self, they got me
(Praying for help)
Askin' somebody else to give me a hand
I'm tryin' hard but I'm only a man, man
(I'm praying for help)
Hopin' somebody else can see what I see
It's like the hood only matter to me the got me
(Prayin' for help)
Hopin' somebody else can carry the torch
I'm all alone with no kinda support
(While I was praying for help)
Realized I don't need nobody else
If God with me I can do it myself
(Tired of just praying for help)
