[sticman]
YeahÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦for all my peoples that's hungry
[chorus]
A nigga need food, ya got to have food for ya health
And clothes, gear to keep a steam for yaself
Son, shelter, a place to lay for rest when ya stressed
Over life, 'cause it's trife and aint no god gon help ya
[sticman]
I feel the winter heart creepinÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦vicious as the wind, which is life, 
when it's deep without a meaninÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦a trife scene it screams 
Niggas fiendinÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦the pipe dream and some be seemin 
like the only way to keep breathin in the slumsÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦but nothing comes
And keeping funds is like dreaminÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
my situation no solutionÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦even the young become demons
Where I'm from shit is unyieldingÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦Something like three-hundred million 
gun wielding black rats trapped in one building
With low ceilingsÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦and no feelingsÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
cutthroat villainsÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ Dope dealingsÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦and glossy eyed pavilions
Sunken facesÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦and powder tracesÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
My people slave for the basicsÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦the powerless devoured in the matrix
Of politics, pimps and glass pipesÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
From gun blast and flickin off blunt ashÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦the cash heist
The fast lifeÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦ where the have-nots rule
Stick and grab plotsÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦toting tools, victim last by some jewels
Round the world, we stay stuck in capsulesÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦shackled
And crackas got homes like castles
I figure the only way this nigga got to go is wild
 Plottin licks for liberationÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦stockin cap style
[chorus x2]
[m-1]
I was born in the storm hearin gun clap from thunder
See my childhood peersÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦catchin years by the number
I wake up from hungerÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦try to lift my stress that I'm under
How I made it this far makes me wonder
You in a fight for ya life, for basic human rights
Can't afford the boomin pricesÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦it's economic crisis
Life is a sacrifice, I'm down to my last bag of rice
They forcin us to live like laboratory mice
Like fuckin laboratory mice that's right
You wear the camaflougeÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦but do u choose to live the soldiers life
I told u before this is a war not a play fight
Taught to be a slave from the womb to the gravesite
Some of us even share the views of the Kaina Knights
Tryna be whiteÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦but they gon lose in this game of life
So dead that! I tie my dread back and schemeÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
Put a star on my red black and greenÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦
[chorus x2]
[bridge]
What do power mean, our team 
seem to think it means sour cream
'cause our dreams got us fiendin for the power son
And huey p said political power come from the barrel of the gun
What do power mean, I believe in thieving
And smoking weed, 'cause everything happens for a reason
I hope my seed grow up and get even, it's open season
And if you poor and black, you know the reasonÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦yeah
