Journey with me into the mind of a maniac
Doomed to be a killer since I came out the nutsac
I'm in a murderous mind state with a heart full of terror
I see the devil in the mirror, buck, buck, lights out
'Cause when I grab my sawed off, niggaz get hauled off
Barrel one touches your motherfuckin' flesh
Barrel two shoots your fuckin' heart out your chest
You see I'm quick to let the hammer go, click
On my Tec-nine, so if you try to wreck mine, fool, it's your bad time
Feel the blast of the chocolate bomber
Infra-red aimed at your head like your name was Sarah Conner
Decapitation, I ain't hesitatin'
To put you in the funderal home with a bullet in your dome
I'm hot like lava, you got a problem?
I got a problem solver and his name is revolver
It's like a deadly game of freeze tag
I touch you with a forty-four Mag
And you're frozen inside a body bag
Nobody iller than this graveyard filler, cap peeler
'Cause Im a natural born killa
Terror illustrates my era
Now I can't hang around my Momma 'cause I scare her
I wanna blast, motherfucker
It feels like Im bustin' a nut when I open you up
'Cause your body is exposed to the midnight mist
All weak motherfuckers give my ring a kiss
'Cause I'm givin' dirt naps
Comin' with them, bomb ass raps
To make your lungs collapse, perhaps
You never sleep 'cause everytime you doze
You catch blows to the motherfuckin' nose
Ain't seen the sun in sixty-six days
Let me count the ways in a fucked up maze
I never ever, ever made a ho stay
But I'm down with Dre like AC is down with OJ
So fuck how you're livin'
I'm the unforgivin', psycho drivin' murderer
It's authentic, don't panic
I can't stand it, goddamn it, schizophrenic
So fuck Charlie Manson
I'll snatch him out of his truck
Hit 'em with a brick and I'm dancin'
Mass murderer, natural born killla
And I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna
I don't wanna die
I don't understand the logic in my dreams
But I understand, I like the sounds of sirens
Terrified screams from the streams of Strychnine
Dumpin' on any motherfucker tryin' to trick mine
'Cause punk motherfuckers wanna violate
Now they stiff and cold and they pupils won't dialate
It's so much pain, migraine, headache
I can hear his bones break
He steps in the single door
Got his ass whipped with twenty lashes
Like that dude up in Singapore
So I'ma pull a fuckin' Jeffrey Dahmer
Now I'm suicidal, just like Nirvana
Tic, toc, toc ,tic, toc, tic
Dr. Dre and Ice Cube on some murderous shit
Keepin' niggaz in order, makin' their life shorter
Ready to slaughter
'Cause to me a life ain't worth a quarter or a dime
Mushroom's got my mind
Hallucinatin' ain't no debatin', I'm creatin'
An escape route to be out without a doubt
Scot free, so don't even
Think about tryin' to stop me 'cause I cant wait
I'm out the gate, on for the realla
A thrilla for a natural born killa
Gi gi gi gi, ga,ga, they call me Dada
Six million ways to murder, choose one
Lose one soul, bodies turn cold
Natural fright from niggaz goin' bump in the night
Should I peely?
Should I kill her in my iller?
Then a natural born killa
Should I peely?
Should I kill her in my iller?
Then a natural born killa
Should I peely?
Should I kill her in my iller?
Then a natural born killa
Should I peely?
Should I kill her in my iller?
Then a natural born killa
