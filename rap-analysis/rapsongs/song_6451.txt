[Verse: Scarface]
Young Face slangin, Ya Ya Ya
Heavyweight, Got a bad bitch in every state
On the grind, nonstop till I touch this cake
Mark ass niggas, stay the fuck up out my way
I be true O.G., you can quote what I say
I'm a H-town nigga from around the way
Southside, ridin' dirty like I'm UGK
Asshole by nature like my name was Tre
And I don't gangbang, I control the Game
What I'm representin' here's puttin' holes in brains
Oh, I say the same thing till I'm old and grey
For I falloff and rap about my clothes and chains
Grippin' grain and poppin' trunks, Dawg that ain't me
These elbows hit the scene back in '83
I stay street with it, dun asked that
You can find me in your hood pumpin' monster crack
I rollover rodents with rims on em
Sniffing out a rat, I expose them and then bend on em
I lotta bitches but they claiming they O.G.s
A straight up pussy, he claims he knows me
See I puttin out these VVdees
Let my shit hit the streets, he got to squat to pee
Got them eggs on these beams, so they watchin' me
Might trap for a rat, pussy watch and see
[Hook:]
I been straight for a long time
Gettin' checks for a long time
Gettin' Jake for a long time
E&J; for a long time
Nigga, try to get like me
Been a G, for a long time
Been in the streets, for a long time
Toting heat, for a long time
Nigga, try to get like me
I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status
I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status
I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status
I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status
i came here to exercise my game
swear love to the hood
that's how i do my thang
smoke weed with my hommies
bar-b-q them wangs
sip hennisy and coke
see i don't fuck with drank
hold out bill ski
because that shit aint cool
we just drunk a mad dog before we went to school	
way up back then i was smashing boys
jump wrong you saw a nigga get his ass destroyed
same shit right now
i demand respect
and if i slap one hoe than a man was next
I'm kick door robber
a hot shot driver
a crack rock slanging mother fucker for a dollar
if there's shit there to be made
then I'm finna make it
but if ther aint no way
than I'm believe take it
cause a nigga with no hustle is his worth is (gay?)
and a bitch like this is even worse then that
I'm a fool bullshiting what this game can cost
and if a nigga cant maintain than man he's lost
being heard and they fuck nerds in jail i heard
and as a nigga i come in here with my balls word 
[Hook:]
I been straight for a long time

Toting heat, for a long time
Nigga, try to get like me
I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status

man on second thought the story is about boys
running round talking bout how they ride these cars
i was sitting in these Benz at the age of 19
when i was 21 i had a yellow ferrari
22 i was portioned with a top at back
23 in a rose with the pipe to match
24 i wasn't tripping what i came up in
i was focussing on how to be like james back then
wonder how respected was the life i chose
being famous wasnt nothing i just liked my dough
i was living in the fast lane
man for sho
short temper quick to up let this thing unload
so if i had a problem with ya
use a blanket no
shaw the message then you see the nigga's brain exploads 
so if you see a nigga chunk da doose as you see me ride by
