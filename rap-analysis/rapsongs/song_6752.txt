Yeah
This is another story about dogs
For the dog that don't pee on trees, is a bitch
So says Snoop Dogg, so get your pooper scooper
'Cuz the nigga's talkin' shit
I'm sippin' on Tanqueray
With my my mind on my money and my mouth fulla gan-jay
R A G to the motherfuckin' E
Back with my nigga, S N double O P
Yeah, and ya don't stop
Rage in effect, I just begun to rock
I said, "Yeah", and you don't quit
Hey yo, Rage would you please drop some gangsta shit?
I rock ruff and stuff with my Afro Puffs
Handcuffed as I bust, 'bout to tear shit up
Oh, what did ya think? I didn't ever think
I would be the one to make you blink eye, I'm catchy like pink-eye
Never will there ever be another like me
Um, you can play the left 'cuz it ain't no right in me
Out the picture, out of the frame, out the box, I knock 'em all
Smack 'em out the park, like 'A friendly game of baseball'
Grand, slam, yes, I am
Kickin' up dust and I don't give a goddamn
'Cuz I'm that lyrical murderer
Pleadin' guilty, you know from my skills I'm about to be
Filthy large, Rage in charge
You know what's happenin', don't try to play large
This ain't no rerun, see hon, don't ya wanna be one
However, Rage'll wreck ya, 'cuz I'm def
I kick my vocals, I loc' yo, coast to coast or local
Uhh! I'll make 'em go coo-coo for my Cocoa
Puffin' stuff, aiyyo Snoop, you're up
Let these niggaz know that niggaz don't give a fuck
This is just a small introduction to the G Funk Era
Everyday of my life I take a glimpse in the mirror
And I see motherfuckers tryin' to be like me
Every since I put it down with the D R E
Foamin' at the mouth and waggin' his tail
Searchin' through the yards with a keen sense of smell
Lookin' for the business in heat
And when he find it he'll be sniffin' her seat
We travel in packs and we do it from the back
How else can you get to the booty?
We do it Doggystyle, all the while we do it Doggystyle
Yo, motherfuckin' hoes
He fucked the fleas off the bitch
He shaked the ticks off his dick
And in the booty, he buries his motherfuckin' bone
And if there's any left over
He'll roll over and take a doggy bag home
(That's me)
Damn, that Tanqueray is talkin' to a nigga
(I ain't bullshittin, one of y'all niggaz gotta get it)
Man, I got ta piss
(Breath test?)
