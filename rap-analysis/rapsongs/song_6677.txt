That's real talk right there baby, Stacey Adams
I'm in a 3 piece suit, lookin' too cute
Mashin' flashin', lookin' for a prostitute
Boo boo, you got that loot
I'm watchin' you, you watchin' me
It's all to the gravy 'cuz it's V.I.P
And everythang in here movin' belong to me
That component set was given to me
By a pimp buddy of mine Disco D.
He told me, Frisco E., this here gone be
The baddest pimp nigga that you ever gone see

Not only that but uhh, make it spectacular
Put on my black cape and look like Blackula
Smack ya up with the shit that I drop
911, call the cops, there's a bitch, snitch
Ain't that a bitch, I can't trust nobody in this son of a bitch
I get rich on the fakers who hate
Bakin' my cake and catch the Lakers at 8
On Channel 9, pop a bottle of wine
Then at 10 hit the club with my nephew Dub
11:30, talkin' dirty to this little birdy
I'm tryin' to get mine early
I can't be seen with your girly
Continue to mash these hoes
I keep it crackin' like pistachios
I get the money first with no rehearsal
Snoop D-O double G, still controversial, and ahh
