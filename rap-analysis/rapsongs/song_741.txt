Peace to the Gods, peace to the Earths
Peace to the positive people of the universe
Brand Nubian came to work it like this
Ya see, each and every day
Each and every way
We're gonna show and prove
Teach you the righteous way
Peace to Allah and justice and justice, justice
Peace to Allah and justice
The knowledge, is the foundation
The wisdom is the way
The understanding shows you
That you are on your way
The culture is our God
The power is the truth
Equally only shows you
That you have planted your roots
God came to teach us
Of the righteous way
How to build and be born
On this glorious day
The knowledge of the cipher
Is to enlighten you
True that true that true that you know
That God is right beside you
