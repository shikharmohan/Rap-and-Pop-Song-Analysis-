I Misplaced The Key 
To Da Lock N Chain

Like A Bleach Stain Or Cranberry
Its Murder She Wrote Like Angela Lanceberry
I Remember Being Small Mayne
New Toyz When My Momma Won A Card Game
Got My Gifts Before Christmas
Didnt Have To Wait For Them 
I Had A 10 Speeder Scooter And A Skateboard (Hahaa)
N We Moved To The Suburbs 
Me N Lil Toya Johnson Was Love Birds Aww Man
N I Swear I Feel Born Again
Im In Da Building Like Da Audience
||Chorus||
Just lightnin up mah LA[x22]
