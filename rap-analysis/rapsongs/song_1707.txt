Mammy, zammy, damn, there's nothin' to me
But when they rock us in the streets, we say, "Ooo-we"
You see the freak in the beat, she do me
I hit that mitty-bitty wit the sticky, ooo-we gooy
I got more funk in my left in my left pinky toe
I got more soul in my style than they will ever know
I got more rhythm than I'll ever need to show
We got them groceries bro, yo, Luniz, let go
I got the flow, so let the Luni man take over
Get deep into my hold if ya lost, then picture gold
I heard styles that others stole but it's no original flow
Like the Luniz an' the man wit the nose
Notice my flows kick like a loaded Mac-11
Ghetto heavy, could climb wit mo "Good Times" than James Devin
Glock wars, meanin' you criticize Tupac for
Homies in the hood, we strap Rugers an' 'We Got More'
Didn't ya know our brothas got more?
So, check the new flow 'cuz here we go-e-o-we-oh
Look how we throw, a lil' sumpthin' to roll to
Hold you, from the o-we-o-we-o
I got that Voodoo runnin' through my veins
Quit, suppressed, yes, crazy, no, not insane
I smoothie through the menu, then I make my order
I got that dominate gene, so, if ya know it, hide yo daughter
The love ya givin' is based on what I do for you
For the right amount of money
You probably let me [Incomprehensible] you
I like to glide up in it but I got my pride, ain't no whore
Don't second guess yo' man 'cuz he got more
Didn't ya know our brothas got more?
So, check the new flow 'cuz here we go-e-o-we-oh
Look how we throw, a lil' sumpthin' to roll to
Hold you, from the o-we-o-we-o
Studio gangstas wanna battle, well, let's battle
I blasted, they plastic ass get put under ground wit the fragments
Snaggle tooth rhymers wit no flavor, save a gang a neighbors
Then move away, so they won't be called haters
Captain Save-A-Hoe, up-up an away ya go
The 'O' is too unfadeable
But don't trip, get a grip, make ya own skit, be sure
Before you slide through the door 'cuz 'We Got More'
Didn't ya know our brothas got more?
So, check the new flow 'cuz here we go-e-o-we-oh
Look how we throw, a lil' sumpthin' to roll to
To bump hoes to from the o-we-o-we-o
Didn't ya know our brothas got more?
So, check the new flow 'cuz here we go-e-o-we-oh
Look how we throw, a lil' sumpthin' to roll to
To bump hoes to from the o-we-o-we-o
