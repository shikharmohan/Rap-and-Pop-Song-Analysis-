Straight up, c'mon Bub, I need you man
Yo, Straight up y'all
Yo Ghost I love you man
You know how we do this right here
We do this for our family
See you soon kid
(Verse One)
The greatest thing a kid could have
To chill with his family, sit back layin on his Dad
Props go out, next thing you know Pops roll out
Moms cussed him out, get the fuck out
Couldn't understand it, feelings turnin to hard granite
Now she a one single parent
Growin up on welfare, she might need healthcare
That made me feel no one else cares
Moms is a part of my life forever
Gettin drunk that's her business guess that's stormy weather
Fish and grits, twelve o' clock midnight pissed
Stop cryin Ma take a kiss
Take care of ya brother and sis
Something happen to me I miss ya better be offic (official)
She meant that shit, every mouthful accurate
Took me to school be emaculate
Taught by the best, remember stress
A ghetto agenda that's how we rest
Don't let'em play with your emotions
Lotioning me, little money in my vest
Damn, Mom going through it
Still holding me through it
Sneaker money fucked up
Yo, Yeah when Granddaddy died
I know you didn't see me cry
Held it in, it hurted Ma alot
Remember, Bucs had me in a tux
Went to beef stake Charlie's had my first pay cut
Yeah, lovin you always screamin on janitors in hallways
It's my son always
Caught me in the crib yo, smokin
Sat me down heart broken, hopin the phase had me open yo
You like, hey yo, for real you like lovin you for life it's only right
Strong yourself we make it
Weak minded you naked
The pain and hurt i can't take it
Plus my Uncle in jail
That's your brother go see him, he look forward to it like mail
You my ace, you the lady in the place
You ain't a waste, we just trapped inside a low-life place
Trust me I'm gonna work hard
Tatto my body, throw it on top where i got scars
See it son, start cryin
(Singing)
