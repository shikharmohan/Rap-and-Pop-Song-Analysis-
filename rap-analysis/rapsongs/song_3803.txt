I gotta find peace of mind, "I know you are never goin' to"
I gotta find peace of mind
See, this is what that voice in your head says
When you try to get peace of mind
I gotta find peace of mind, I gotta find peace of mind
He says it's impossible
But I know it's possible
He says it's impossible
But I know it's possible
He says there's no me without him, please help me forget about him
He takes all my energy, trapped in my memory
Constantly holdin' me, constantly holdin' me
I need to tell you all, all the pain he's caused
I need to tell you I'm, I'm undone because
He says it's impossible
But I know it's possible
He says it's impossible without him
But I know it's possible
To finally be in love and know the real meaning of
A lasting relationship, not based on ownership
I trust every part of you 'cause all that I
All that you say you do, you love me despite myself
Sometimes I, I fight myself
I just can't believe that you
Would have anything to do
With someone so insecure
Someone so immature
Oh, you inspire me to be the higher me
You make my desire pure, you make my desire pure
Just tell me what to say, I can't find the words to say
Please don't be mad with me, I have no identity
All that I've known is gone, all I was buildin' on
I wanna walk with you, how do I talk to you?
Touch my mouth with your hands, touch my mouth with your hands
Oh, I wanna understand the meaning of your embrace
I know now I have to face the temptations of my past
Please don't let me disgrace, will my devotion last?
Now that I know the truth, now that it's no excuse
Keeping me from your love, what was I thinkin' of
Holdin' me from ya love, what was I thinkin' of
You are my peace of mind
That old me is left behind
You are my peace of mind
That old me is left behind there
He says it's impossible
But I know it's possible
He says it's improbable
But I know it's tangible
He says it's not grabable
But I know it's havable
'Coz anything's possible
Oh, anything is possible
Please come free my mind
Please come free my mind
Can you see my mind, oh
Won't you come free my mind?
Oh, I know it's possible
Anything, anything, anything, anything, anything, yeah
Anything, anything, anything, anything, yeah
Anything, anything, anything, anything, anything, yeah
Oh, free, free, free, free your mind
Free, free your mind
Free, free your mind
Free, free, free, free your mind
Oh, it's so possible
Oh, it's so possible
I'm telling you it's possible
I'm telling you it's possible
Free, free, free, free
Free, free, get free now
Free, free, free, free
Free, free, free, free
You are my peace of mind
That old me is left behind
You are my peace of mind
You are my peace of mind
He's my peace of mind
He's my peace of mind
He's my peace of mind
What a joy it is to be alive
To get another chance, yeah
Every day's another chance
They get it right this time
Every day's another chance
Oh, what a merciful, merciful, merciful God
What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful God
What a merciful, merciful, merciful, merciful, merciful
What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, merciful
Merciful, merciful, wonderful, merciful, wonderful, yeah
