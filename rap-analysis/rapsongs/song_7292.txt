What's happenin' man? This TIP, you know?
I'd like to dedicate this song to
Anybody who done ever lost somebody
To the grave, to the streets, to the jail cell
I done been in situations where I had
To cope with all three, you know what I'm sayin'?
I feel like the only thing I ain't done yet is died, you know?
But it ain't how I live while I'm here
It's how I live when I leave, ya dig?
Life's ups and downs they come and go
But when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folks who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die, that I live in the sky
It's true what goes around, comes back you know
So when I die I hope I live in the sky
All my folks who ain't survive, may they live in the sky
Tell God, I wanna fly, let me live in the sky
My cousin Toot ain't have to die, right in front of his son and his wife
He lost his life struggling over a gun
Give a damn what he done, that's my motherfuckin' folk
And I love that nigga to death, no motherfuckin' joke
I can feel my eyes fillin', the Lord is my witness
If I catch 'em, I'ma kill 'em, I made it my business
Back in the day, you stayed in my business
Taught me I ain't have to incorporate yay in my business
Coincidentally, that's why today you not wit me
My cousin died over some yay, and I miss him
Plus he had his family out, let's say she the eye witness
But her boyfriend did the shootin', judge gave her life sentence
I heard that, now I'm dressed up in all black
Shot up the whole apartment's, he still ain't brought back
The best friend I had in Jamel, I lost that
Guess ya death was a lesson in life, it taught me that
Life's ups and downs they come and go
But when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folks who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die, that I live in the sky
It's true what goes around, comes back you know
So when I die I hope I live in the sky
All my folks who ain't survive, may they live in the sky
Tell God, I wanna fly, and let me live in the sky
Never seen a nigga go to jail and sleep til day two
Well that's how sick I was when Jayrue
Found out the hard way that was powder they were tootin'
Over-dosed on heroin, died at 22
If you ain't heard about your daughter, she smile just like you
So cute, even resorts to violence like you
You know your baby momma loose, but ha, what can you do
And I got for myself, yuh, it's been a few
Now everything I do is for King, Messiah, Dazasha, Demonte
Tell the Lord they all I've got, so please don't take them from me
From me standin' in the trap wit qerin and sir kap
Laughin' at the niggaz who serve with no strap
Tell them niggaz, man, y'all trippin' with no maps
Get robbed, and that's the part of my pistol ain't no help
Me, you and the crew just fell out over dough and a lil' crack
Never could apologize 'cause you died, that's why they say that
Life's ups and downs they come and go
But when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folks who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die, that I live in the sky
It's true what goes around, comes back you know
So when I die I hope I live in the sky
All my folks who ain't survive, may they live in the sky
Tell God, I wanna fly, and let me live in the sky
I bet you niggaz think I'm livin' it up
'Til you see polices laughin' as they pickin' me up
Went from seeing how many bitches I can fit in the truck
To three hots and a cot, is you kiddin' or what?
Fuck how many millions I got, nigga, so what if I'm hot
When I got prices on my head, Feds rushin' my spot
A million haters want me dead, forced to carry a gat
But you's a seven-time felon, what you doin' wit that?
It's a Catch-22, either you lose or you lose
That's the way the game structured, for real, niggaz to suffer
And I ain't neva been a buster, always stood on my feet
Like a man prepared to take whatever coming for me
A pussy nigga or polices with a warrant for me
I'm a G, prepared to die for what's important to me
Look anybody in the eye who say he want it wit me
Put up the house and bet the odds if it's comin' from me
OG's say I need to learn to be patient
You telling me with these seven years of probation
Pistol charges and a host of other open cases
If niggaz only knew the kind of time I was facin'
I tried to keep it to myself, but sometimes I couldn't take it
Got four kids, the smiles on they faces
Mean more to me than my crown and my bracelet
Take that away from me, and my life is butt naked
Life's ups and downs they come and go
But when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folks who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die, that I live in the sky
It's true what goes around, comes back you know
So when I die I hope I live in the sky
All my folks who ain't survive, may they live in the sky
Tell God, I wanna fly, and let me live in the sky
Aye man, I'd like to dedicate this song to my cousin Toot
Alahondro Jamera Morgan man, I miss the shit out of you my nigga
Also I'd like to dedicate this to my homeboy Jayrue
Jamar Hendrix what's happenin'?
Also my partna Bankhead, [Incomprehensible]
What it is nigga, PSC for life and death
And my lil' homeboy Poncho, and my lil' homeboy Rico
I shed tears writin' this song homeboy, that's real talk man
Ayee I wanna live in the sky, sky, sky
Hey let me live in the sky, sky
Pray to God that I live in the sky, sky, sky
I want to live in the sky

I want to live in the sky
Why can't we live in the sky, the sky?
