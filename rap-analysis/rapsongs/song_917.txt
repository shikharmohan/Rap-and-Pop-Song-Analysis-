Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man
Yo, yo, yo, I can't understand
Why the parents and the teachers
And everybody trying to o the kids
The young generation yo,
What's the deal brah, charlie brown, man
[charlie brown]
I don't know what the deal is
You hafta ask my partna dinco d
Yo yo tell us d tell us d
Mass confusion g, I don't know what's up
Hey yo man
(it's just another case of that old pta)
Huh man
[dinco d]
In school I wrote notes and took quotes from shakespeare
And other types of rhymes to show you that I (care)
But things like together forever to you my only one (only one)
It was special I can say it was another one
You would say someone's knocking at my window
(knock knock)
Someone's ringing my bell
(ding dong)
It's about two in the morning
(hey yo g, what the hell's going on? )
(it's just another case of that old pta)
But never the less here goes to show my potential
And even though our love was three-dimensional
One (me) two (you) three (your pops) now what am I to do
I had to transform into educated lad
Going around doing chores for your dad
Playing a duck, wearing sweaters and shoes
Chilling with pop just listen to the blues
And talking to your mom about a love for her daughter
Suggesting to me that I just oughta
Watch myself
(inch by inch)
Watch myself
(and use some sense)
So I did
(hey)
It didn't do a damn thing
But a case to complain, so now I sing
(it's just another case of that old pta)
[busta]
Roaarrr busta rhymes the mighty infamous
Always misbehaving and mischeivous
Causing aggravation I'll never pause
Pushing out spit balls through plastic straws
(in class)
In gym I got caught at last
For ligthing up the courtyard grass
(hey)
Teacher, teacher, go to the flesh
(busta rhymes liked to killed the complex)
Hey yo
In class, kicked it to this girl cheryl
(what? )
The teacher try to tell me I was pharoah
(no no no)
I'm not with detention no no with suspension
A child's wickeddy wild the calbridge hill styles
Teach us just a knowledge to go talk to my mommy
Now when she gets home, she's gonna wear out the body
I hate this relationship, the mom and teacher
When she reaches home hey yo she knows that I reached ya
Ok, of today I am the new school, pray
Between my momma, teacher, and my dad hey yo
(it's just another case of that old pta)
[charlie brown]
Aahhh
Yo teachers hate me the girls don't take me
Because I'm c brown
(class clown)
Gettin still aah sometimes I chill yo
Depending on the day and (how I feel)
Sometimes I leave an apple that's rotten and (brown)
No where to be found
Poll tax on sheets, five days a week
Arrive in the lunchroom, I gotta get some sleep
But I didn't do it
(you did it)
I'm suspended
(you was wit' it)
And now it's time to pay for the crime
That I never got caught like judge wapner
(bam! take on the court)
A room of teachers, parents, and preachers
A principal and one kid dress in sneakers
Case of brown versus the board
(order order)
Yo twelve, verse one is a slaughter
I pleaded my case
Aah
Face to face
Aah
It was a waste
And everyone was in place yo
He announced me guilty you have
(three hundred sixty four days)
Of detention to serve
(some nerve)
I felt this could be from (pissed)
The head of the board said "case dismissed"
As I walk out the room I hear them say
Aahyaaheeyaaheeyaaheeyaaheeyaaheeyaaheeyaahee
(it's just another case of that old pta)
