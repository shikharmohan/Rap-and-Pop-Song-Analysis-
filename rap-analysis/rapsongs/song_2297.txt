Woke up quick at about noon
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon
I gotta get drunk before the day began
Before my mother starts bitchin' about my friends
About to go and damn near went blind
Young niggaz throwin' up pads, throwin' up gang signs
I ran in the house to get the clip
With my Mac-10 on the side of my hip
I bailed outside and I pointed my weapon
Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin'
I jumped in the floor, hit the juice on my ride
I got front and back, side to side
Then I let the Alpine play
I was bumpin' new shit by NWA
It was 'Gangsta Gangsta' at the top of the list
Then I played my own shit, it went somethin' like this
Cruisin' down the street in my six-fo'
Jockin' the bitches, slappin' the hoes
I went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin' some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rollin', Kilo G
He rolls down the window and he starts to say
It's all about makin' that GTA
'Cuz the boyz in the hood are always hard
Come talkin' that trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, I ain't said shit
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I go to a place where my homeboys chill
The fellows out there tryna make that dollar
I pulled up in my 64 Impala
Greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin'
And from the 8-ball my breath start stinkin'
I gotta get my girl to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to the house to get her out of the pad
Dumb hoe said something to make me mad
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
Started talkin' shit, wouldn't she know?
I reached back like a pimp and I slapped the hoe
Father stood up and he started to shout
So I threw a right-cross and I dissolved out
'Cuz the boyz in the hood are always hard
Come talkin' that trash and we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, I ain't said shit
[Incomprehensible] trippin , it's alright
Homie's scored a key, he's gonna fly
Punk fly
