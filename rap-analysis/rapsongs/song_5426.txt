I know your not my man
That you belong to someone else
Now come on in, an shut the door
I make sure you enjoy yourself
If you give me a try, before you deny
I'm still in love wit you
Or maybe obsessed wit you
We don't make love no more
We don't kiss and we hug like we used to, used to
But I'm still in love with you
Wait, wait a minute
Now if I drive by your house
And see some bitch in your bed, under the spreads
Giving you head, then I'm gonna turn it out
I'm the only one who keep you satisfied
And though were not together I remember what you like
So tell them chicks to step off 'cause I fill your appetite
I'm the only women who gonna do it like you like
What part don't you get?
Even though I'm not your girl anymore
And you don't want me no more
I deserve to know who you sleepin' with
Is she better then me?
Do she cook, do she clean?
Do she sew, do she sting?
Can she do these things?
'Cause I
I'm the only one who keep you satisfied
And though were not together I remember what you like
So tell them chicks to step off 'cause I fill your appetite
I'm the only women who gonna do it like you like
I still love ya baby
Makes no difference to me
And I still wantcha baby
Want to be the one you need
The one you call on
'Cause I'm the only one that makes you feel good
Sing it to me
I'm the only one who keep you satisfied
And though were not together I remember what you like
So tell them chicks to step off 'cause I fill your appetite
I'm the only women who gonna do it like you like
I'm the only one who keep you satisfied
And though were not together I remember what you like
So tell them chicks to step off 'cause I fill your appetite
I'm the only women who gonna do it like you like
