Whatta you know?
Whatta you know?
Whatta you know?
Whatta you know? The nigga stole my dough
So I reached in the closet for the 4-4
(Whatta you know?)
Jus' hold on, just wait a minute it's gone
Along with my big bad nickel-plated
Whatta you know? The fucker took my phone
I still can't believe that he robbed my home
Whatta you know? I think he got to the herb
And the ferria, and the jewelery, and the Mossberg
Whatta you know? I can't find my keys to the 6-5
All the way live on D's
Whatta you know? I can't find my Rolex
With the 21 diamonds, shinin' on flecks
Whatta you know? When I find that mark-ass nigga
I'ma cut out his fuckin' heart
Whatta you know? I came up on this baller
For the dollar and the weed sack, and his impala
Whatta you think? When you can't trust your so-called homie
Like me, and you thought that you know me?
Whatta you feel? When you're lookin' in the closet
And the gat's gone, and so is your cellular phone?
Whatta you know? I took your loot and the jewels
With the Buddha and the laptop in the nickel-plated tool
Whatta you know? Now I run the show
With the phat pockets and the nigga's fly gold
Whatta you think? When you ass gets jacked
By a homie who was supposed to have your back?
Whatta you know? I'm rollin' in my zone
And I think I see the Puto who rigged my home
(Whatta you know?)
I got the glock in the glove, should I dump on the man
Leave him lying in the mud?
Whatta you know? he pulled out my 4-4
Now I got no choice, so I let it all flow
(Whatta you know?)
The motherfucker's all blastin' 4-5 equal
In time for some tractions
(Whatta you know?)
Slide action, no question forty-five
Slug is bad for your complexion
(Whatta you know?)
The Puto's cryin' like a bitch
Now the Puto's lyin' in a fuckin' ditch
(Whatta you know?)
You can't even trust your fuckin' best homeboy these days, homes
(Whatta you know?)
You got to sleep with one nine fuckin' open
(Whatta you know?)
Paybacks a motherfuckin' bitch'
(Whatta you know?)
That Puto should've watched his fuckin' back
Whatta you know?
Whatta you know?
Whatta you know?
Whatta you know?
