Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man, whatta mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man, whatta mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man, whatta mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man, whatta mighty good man
I wanna take a minute or two and give much respect to
To the man that's made a difference in my world
And although most men are hoes, he goes on the down low
'Cuz I never heard about him with another girl
But I don't sweat it because it's just pathetic to let it
"Get me involved in that", he said, she said, "Crowd"
I know that ain't nobody perfect
I give props to those who deserve it
And believe me ya'll he's worth it
So here's to the future 'cuz we got through the past
I finally found somebody who can make me laugh
You so crazy, I think I wanna have yo baby
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man, whatta mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man, whatta mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man, whatta mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man, whatta mighty good man
My man is smooth like Barry and his voice got bass
A body like Arnold with a Denzel face, he's smart like a doctor
With a real good rep and when he comes home, he's relaxed with pep
He always got a gift for me, everytime I see him
A lot of snot nose, ex-flames couldn't be him
He never ran a corny line once to me yet, so I give him stuff
That he'll never forget, he keeps me on cloud 9 just like intended
He's not a fake wannabe, tryin' to be a pimp
He dresses like a Dapper Don, but even in jeans
He's a God sent original, the man of my dreams
Yes, my man says he loves me, never says he loves me not
Not to rush me good and touch me in the right spot
See other guys that I've had, they've tried to play all the mac
But everytime they tried, I've said, "That's not it"
But not this man, he's got the right potion
Baby rub it down and make it smooth like lotion
He's the original highway to heaven
From seven to seven he's got me open like seven eleven
And yes, it's me that he's always choosin', with him I'm never loosin'
And he knows that my name is not Susan
He always has heavy conversation for the mind
Which means a lot to me 'cuz good men are hard to find
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man, whatta might good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man, whatta might good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man, whatta might good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man, whatta might good man
I said, "Whatta mighty good man
Know what I'm saying?
He's a mighty mighty good man
Ya'll don't hear me, now check him out"
My man gives real lovin', that's why I call him killa
He's not a wham bam, thank you mam, he's a thrilla
He takes his time and does everything right
Knocks me out with one shot for the rest of the night
He's a real smooth brotha, never in a rush
And he gives me goose pimples with every single touch
Spends quality time with his kids when he can
Secure in his manhood 'cuz he's a real man
A lover and a fighter and he'll knock another out
Don't take him for a sucka 'cuz it's not what he's about
Everytime I need him, he always got my back
Never disrespectful for 'cuz his momma taught him that
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man, whatta mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man, whatta mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man, whatta mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man, whatta mighty good man
He's a mighty mighty good man, yo
What a mighty mighty good man, yo, yeah
What a mighty good man, yeah
Now break it down, I break it down one time
Whatta man, whatta man
Whatta man, whatta man
Whatta man, whatta man
Whatta man, whatta man
