You have the emergence in human society
Of this thing that's called the State
What is the State? The State is this organized bureaucracy
It is the police department, it is the Army, the Navy
It is the prison system, the courts and what have you
This is the State it is a repressive organization
But the State and gee, well, you know you've got to have
The police because if there were no police
Look at what you'd be doing to yourselves
You'd be killing each other if there were no police
But the reality is the police become necessary in human society
Only at that junction in human society where it is split
Between those who have and those who ain't got
I throw a Molotov cocktail at the precinct, you know how we think
Organize the hood under I Ching banners
Red, black and green instead of gang bandannas
FBI spying on us through the radio antennas
And them hidden cameras in the streetlight watching society
With no respect for the people's right to privacy
I'll take a slug for the cause like Huey P.
While all you fake niggas try to copy Master P I want to be free to live
Hey but, they have what I need to live
Bring the power back to the street where the people live
I'm sick of working for crumbs and filling up the prisons
Dying over money and relying on religion for help
We do for self like ants in a colony
Organize the wealth into a socialist economy
A way of life based off the common need
And all my comrades are ready, we just spreading the seed
The average black male live a third of his life in a jail cell
'Cause the world is controlled by the white male
And the people don' never get justice
And the women don' never get respected
And the problems don' never get solved
And the jobs don' never pay enough
So the rent always be late
Can you relate? We living in a Police State
No more bondage, no more political monsters
No more secret space launchers
Government departments started it in the projects
Material objects, thousands up in the closets
Could've been invested in a future for my comrades
Battle contacts, primitive weapons out in combat
Many never come back, pretty niggas be running with gats
Rather get shot in they back than fire back, we tired of that
Corporations hiring blacks, denying the facts
Exploiting us all over the map
That's why I write the shit, I write in my raps
It's documented, I'm in it
Everyday of the week I live in it, breathing it
It's more than just fucking believing it
I'm holding in ones, rolling up my sleeves an' shit
It's Cee-lo for push-ups, now
Many headed for one conclusion
Niggas ain't ready for revolution
The average black male live a third of his life in a jail cell
'Cause the world is controlled by the white male
And the people don' never get justice
And the women don' never get respected
And the problems don' never get solved
And the jobs don' never pay enough
So the rent always be late
Can you relate? We living in a Police State
That's right that developed me
Brought me here and worked me like an animal
Built the political economy off my stolen labor
Made them rich, made me poor
The average black male live a third of his life in a jail cell
'Cause the world is controlled by the white male
And the people don' never get justice
And the women don' never get respected
And the problems don' never get solved
And the jobs don' never pay enough
So the rent always be late
Can you relate? We living in a police state
Why is it that black people and everybody like us
Live in the kind of poverty and misery that we live in?
Everywhere I look around me are nothing but poverty and misery
On the one hand and yet, what I'm seeing is that
Everywhere there's wealth and riches in the world
It's in the white community somewhere
Whether it's in Europe or whether it's right 'cross the
Street from where I was born
