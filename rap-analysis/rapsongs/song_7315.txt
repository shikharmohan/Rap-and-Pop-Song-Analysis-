Dez niggas robbing me, pray to God is nothing but a robbery
I gave them all I had, so they'll pull they lick off flawlessly
They yelling fussing, cussing but all I hear is Heaven calling
Me next thing, I know they busting, they left me seven
And they all in me on fallen knees, help me, please, death is all I see
If I die memory of a fallin' G is all I'll be
Never thought I'll be lying in a poodle of blood trying to breath
I don't want to die but something is telling me
It's time to leave say my apologizes, make my final peace with God
Seen my whole life flash before my eyes
And now it's getting dark, body temp done dropped
Going in shock crying out of fear closed my eyes
Took my last breath and I'm out here
In my life I smoked a lot of weed, drunk a lot beer sold a lot of keys
But that shit don't even matter here
Somebody said walk toward the light but I ain't not ready to go
Am I dead? Is it over? You ain't ready to know
Well, now I moving toward the light and I ain't walking or nothing
I ain't like the shit, well hell, I guess ain't use for me to try to fight
The shit what the business is you God, I been waiting to meet you
And I knew after hearing bout y'all my life that one day I would see you
But why you let dem niggas kill me
You could have done something, why you ain't come down there
And shield me when them niggas started busin'?
Then he said, excuseth me but I controleth no hatin'
And it cometh not from me, well, who it coming from? Satan
Oh, Satan did this, excuse me, Lord but that there niggas on my shit list
I know with all this fly shit you got a A K
Or a pistol grip give me a click of angels and some bullet proof wing
Lufica finna get pistol whipped alive or dead I ain't scared
Who he think he is fucking with Tip
I got a A K two 45's 'bout 50 clip, I'm fixto dip
I ain't borrow shit, I'm fixto trip, put a piston grip and loose thy lip
And then he say two wrong doing maketh it not a right one a last
Well, forgiveth me 'cause I'm 'bout to ride out on Luficas ass
And all I need You to do is give me
The strength and Lord, You know I'ma need You
With the shit, I'm fixto attempt
I'm fix to bust Hell wide open, fear don't control me
And I'm O.G. Hell, can't hold me
Now, 'Pac and Biggie want ride too
I guess that's cool sense that muthafucker
The reason y'all niggas had to die too
My nigga Bankhead would be alive too, shawty let ride
It's 4serious up here dough 'cause we don't ride we glade
Now, I'm strapped and ready folks but I can't steam to do a thing
With these wings, how I'm supposed to keep them steady, folks?
With a chopper on back of two 44's shawty no, A the pain we fixto bring
I don't think he even ready, for when it's on, you already know
Farewell bruh, mamma always told me
I was bad enough to tear hell up
I'm doing this for what you made of
From that time you made the bitch eat the apple
To the time you sent your folks
To put us on the boat and enslave us
Worked us and never paid us
Killed Malcolm X, Martin Luther King
And everybody else tried to come down here and save us
Kept our fathers from raising us, kidnapped us from our country
Took our tradition and our religion away from us
Well, now it's time for the K to bust
We want our spirits and our minds back now
I'm getting mines right now, pussy nigga, lay it down, I'm walkin'
Thought Hell, kicking the Devil's doors down
Spraying rounds waving the K round, Well, I woke up
I was lying down, shawty, what happened?
