My twinkies looks stanky on the Benz
And don't I gotta look shweet for my mens
I make 'em think I got a whole bunch of paper
And even date a ball player from the Lakers
Now faker taker maker holla at cha later
Shake and wake up tell 'em what to get my ass from Jacobs
That's the way a real diva like to floss it
Buy a car no matter what it costess
Of course, its my Rolls Royce's made dem nosses
Tell you who the muthafuckin' boss is
I'm a drive and you walkin' that's why you talkin'
See the chrome spinnin' on the wheel stop jockin'
I'ma let you know real nice and slow I'll be broke as a joke
If I had to be your ho so po'
Missy on the rise like the sun if you think
That I'm done I ain't even begun
Slide, slide, dip, shake
Move it all around, move it all around
Slide, slide, dip, shake
Move it all around, move it all around
Feel the boom bass to get you bad kit
Fifteen's putting holes in you back kit
Bo bo boom, bo bo boom, bo bo boom, bo bo boom
Don't it sound so fantastic
My Lamborghini disappear like Houdini
Two tewnty can't see me in a bottle like a Genie
Teenie, Weenie
Now hate me like you hate to eat your wheaties
Now here's a freebie
I'ma let you see my on TV
Acceptin' my Emmy or da Grammy in Miami
I hit you with the one two whammie
Your no tooth granny with a hole in her panties
And I don't give a shit if you can't stan' me 'cause
I is what I is and what I am is like my Mamey
And I don't mean to sound to Peti
But they used to call me fatty
Till I got with Puff Daddy
Slide, slide, dip, shake
Move it all around, move it all around
Slide, slide, dip, shake
Move it all around move it all around
My rims keep turnin' and turnin'
Tires burnin' through Queens and Mt. Vernon
And yes, it's my concern that
You chain platinum or is it really sterlin'?
I'm old school, I rock da Sherlin
From New Jers. heard all the way to Berlin
And as for certain behind every curtain
Is a snake bitch lerkin' and she about to catch a hurtin'
Mr. Moles on da beats
And Missy be the beats behind the beats
My record sales gonna jump and do leaps and
While you sleep I'm on the grind as a creep
Sho creep
I got Puma's on my feet
Fresh gear, e'ryday all week
You know I keep a high from a peeps never cheap
Underground like the streets
Slide, slide, dip, shake
Move it all around, move it all around
Slide, slide, dip, shake
Move it all around move it all around
