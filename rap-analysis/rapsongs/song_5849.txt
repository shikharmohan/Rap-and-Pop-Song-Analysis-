Shit, shit, Mystikal
That's that, that's that
That's that, that's that
That's that, that's that
That's that shit
That's the reason the bitches be trying to get the worm out the zipper
That's the reason niggas gon' have to learn that I'm the ripper
Scrape up crumbs and turn 'em into nickels
Then bounce 'em into dimes then I turn 'em into flippers
I can't do my rhymes like you do yo rhymes 'cause it isn't
You can't make your shit try to sound like mine 'cause it isn't
I run right at the top of the line, get your mind right nigga
Murder was the case 'cause I shine at night nigga
The man with the braids in his hair, two tounged live nigga
Let him fire nigga, I ride with five niggas
Live from the west and I bring it back home
Ducked off in the bonneville, blowing up the zone
Roamin', cutting up on my cell phone
Hundred miles per hour in the wind and I'm gone
Watch them jails find the twenty inch wheels twirls
Hoes hatin' in the back, fuck 'em girl
I stand up like a pit, swingin' my big dick
Take a picture, feet stickin' like scotch tape bitch
I swear to God I'll fuck over yay yay
Have you sitting on your porch, gettin' pushed in your rocking chair
That's that, that's that
That's that, that's that
That's that, that's that
That's that shit
That's that, that's that
That's that, that's that
That's that, that's that
That's that shit
I come in to put my two cents on a two inch
Tearing down the fuckin' building and the blue prints
Any sign of intrudence, come your ass down here
And ask them who the fool is
Raise your hand and talk to the teacher, no, students, students
I like to sing a about the boota and the tooters
Smoke the purple bubble gum, merge crazy blue vooda
Y'all past tense, I'm the black prince ruler
Sharp shooter, chopatula to talula
Point blank bitch, gone, gone
Full blast turning up the water all the way on
Hi, my name is, Mystikal
I handle my business, deliver my lyrics ever since I hit the door
When I come around in this muthafucka your arms fall off
You can't touch me, your jaw break, you don't say nothing
Fuck around and let my second wind kick in
I better be makin' you feel like the booty that the dick went in bitch
That's that, that's that
That's that, that's that
That's that, that's that
That's that shit
That's that, that's that
That's that, that's that
That's that, that's that
That's that shit
That's that, that's that shit
That's that, that's that shit bitch
That's that, thats that
Thats that shit
That's that, that's that
That's that, that's that
That's that, that's that
That's that shit
