Yo Redman is the COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLEST shit I done fuckin heard!
(Yeah, hahaha... this is Dr. Trevis, comin to y'all motherfuckers live)
[Redman]
Yo, I'm spittin my rhymes, we gonna get you
To bump the music to break your neck to
(Yo yo yo yo, ay ay ay) Yeah
(Y'all muh'fuckers ain't ready)
Yo, when I spit my rhymes, we gonna get you
To bump the music to break your neck to
You want the hard shit, nigga let me connect you
It's 1-800-YO-GILLA; feel me flow
I open doors for the newcomers
I show you how to rock the mic, pull yo' pants up and do somethin
I lay my hats where my boots stompin
Whether Jersey or Australia with kangaroo jumpin
Yeah, I feel that hip-hop's gone
My pen catch attitudes, it cry in a song
I laugh cause I'm a vet, and still get the guap as strong
as any nigga, I ain't alarmed
Yes y'all, it's the Doc, I'm back on my business
With jizz for, real niggaz and my bitches
I got my hands on my steerin wheel and stick shift
Drivin by nigga, pissin on yo' picnic
[Chorus 2X: Redman]
One time for your motherfuckin mind {"Comin straight from the.."}
One time for your motherfuckin mind {"Comin straight from the.."}
One time for your motherfuckin mind
Gilla House, is back in the buildin
[Redman]
Yo, yo I'm back on my grizzly, set the bear trap
We don't work for Nike but sure can (Air) a mac
My pen game tight in the hood like hair wraps
You a (40 Year Old Virgin), gettin hair waxed
Now, Reggie Noble '07 internation-al
My girl got guns in her speghetti-strap gown
If you love hip-hop, where my people at now?
Relax now, got it mapped down, Gilla House
I jump in the crowd (ohhhhhhhhhh!)
Whenever I do it I do it loud, grown man style
Since I was a child butt-naked
I knew I would grow to be the one {?} on record
[Chorus w/ ad libs]
Ride nigga!
