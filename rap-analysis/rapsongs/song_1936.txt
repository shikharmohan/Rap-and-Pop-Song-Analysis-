In the name of Jesus
No weapon formed against me shall prosper (preach)
And every tongue that rises against me in judgment thou shall Condemn (preach)
For this is the heritage of the servant of the Lord (preach)
And that righteousness is of me says the lord (preach)
Amen 
Lord give me a sign 
Verse 1
I really need to talk to you lord 
Since the last time we talked the walk has been hard 
Now I know you haven't left me but I feel like I'm alone 
I'm a big boy now but I'm still not grown 
And Im still goin thru it the pain and the hurt 
Soaking up trouble like rain and the dirt 
And I know only I could stop the rain 
With just the mention of my saviors name 
In the name of Jesus 
Devil I rebuke you for what I go through 
And trying to make me do what I used to 
But all that stops right here 
As long as the lord's in my life I will have no fear
I will know no pain from the light to the dark 
Imma show no shame spit it right from the heart 
This is right from the start, you held me down 
And ain't nothing they can tell me know 
Lord give me a sign

Let me know what's on your mind let me know what I'm gonna find 
It's all in time show me how to teach the mind show me how to reach The blind 
Lord give me a sign, show me what I gots to do to bring me closer to You cause Imma go do whatever you want me to just let me know what to do Lord give me a sign 
Verse 2 
Please show me something 
I'm tired of talking to him knowing he frontin 
Crying 'bout life ain't nothin'
Cause you either be the one mad cause you trapped or the one huntin 
Trapped in your own mind waiting on the Lord 
Or huntin with the word that cuts like a sword
The spoken word is stronger than the strongest man 
Carries the whole world like the strongest hand 
With the trial and tribulations you never let us down 
Jesus
I know you here with us now
Jesus
I know you still with us now 
Keep it real with us now I wanna feel show me how 
Please let me take your hand 
Guide me or walk slow but stay right beside me 
Devil's tryin to find me, hide me 
Hold up I take that back
Protect me and give me the strength to fight back 
Lord give me a sign

Where'd you go?

Seems like it's been forever 
That you've been gone

Seems like it's been forever
