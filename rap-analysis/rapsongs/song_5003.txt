When the fighters are all around, all the lovers are underground
No one will save you anymore, so what's happenin'?
What you rappin' about? It's a boy
Is it cars? Is it girls? Is it my lie, the world?
Or is it somethin' they could never believe?
Or is it somethin' you could never achieve?
Is it beyond your means? Is it inside your dreams?
Can it never come out 'cuz it's scared to, unprepared to
Too worried about the words of the people it's weird too?
You don't want them to hear you
You just wish it was a door that would appear
That you can go disappear through
Well I'm feelin' your pain, I was feelin' the same
But I said, "I'd never feel that again"
When the fighters are all around, all the lovers are underground
No one will save you anymore, so what's happenin'?
What you rappin' about? It's a boy
Is it cars? Is it girls? Is it my lie, the world?
Man, I really miss my pops
Hope that God watches over him and that he's on top
That there is no more disease and that he's alright
That he's one of the generals inside the Army of the Light
And grandma, you know I had to bite somethin' from ya
So after every show it's 'Peace, and much love to ya'
Auntie Tweety's on the way, please look out for that girl
I know we'll meet again, so it's never me against the world
When the fighters are all around, all the lovers are underground
No one will save you anymore, so what's happenin'?
What you rappin' about? It's a boy
Is it cars? Is it girls? Is it my lie, the world?
I hope that God forgive us, all of us sinners
Turn us back into beginners, put us up where the winners go
Holy apartments in the gardens in which the rivers flow
Thank You for all your blessings and all of Your miracles
I thank all my fans, and all my supporters
Shout out to Bishop G, congrats on your new baby daughter
I tip my hat to all my family and friends
Now we just got one more to go, L.U.P. End
When the fighters are all around, all the lovers are underground
No one will save you anymore, so what's happenin'?
What you rappin' about? It's a boy
Is it cars? Is it girls? Is it my lie, the world?
