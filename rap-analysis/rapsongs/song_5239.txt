[Streetlife]
Yo, I know the streets is watchin'
Dirty date niggas caught blockin' or glockin'
Waitin' for my down four street got options
Fuck y'all, y'all can ball, im'a stay rockin'
All emcee's falled when I heard the albums droppin'
Nuttin but the hottest hip-hop rap concoction
Rap's in a state of emergency, it's shockin'
I produce joints that loosen up the socket
Crowd surf through the mosh pit on some rock shit
Bang your head to this, pump your fist if your feelin' it
Ride the fuck out, bust a clip for the fuck of it
This is as good as it get, who you rollin' with? (You)
Who the ultimate? (Wu)
Stay commited, sold my soul to this rap shit
Slow your roll, strike a bowl, you get glapped quick
I roll with, ghetto bastard with biscuits
And grab my dick and flick it, get the picture
[Redman]
Yo, Yo, Yo, I cop a new Benz, crash the front
So hard the airbags use nasal pumps
Jump out, cock the shoti (Rasie em up)
I stomp holes if the ground aint paved enough
Inform the former the first step was a warm-up
The next step'll bomb on where your car alarm was
Chikens that'll run in, burn the barn up
Shots'll tear Sean John and Phat Farm up
I never gotta Soul Train award
Never lost to emcee's as lame as y'all
Never, trick a bitch car payment off
Im a orangatang when the chain is off
Nigga, ecentric and I slowly blast with a axe, and a pump, and a goalie mask
Leavin' stains of blood on your Rolie Glass
When im in your hood nigga throw me bags
[Method Man]
Lets trick the night fantastic
Im flexable, they used to call me plastic
These big butt bitches get they ass kicked
It is what it is, shittin' on y'all kids
Couldn't live where we live
I can't be defeated like nobody used to wizz
Like, when daddy's home can't nobody beat the kids
Right? You know the clan and you know the fuckin' man
Meth rock a mic without a kickstand
Two blunts, and razors in his wristband
Slap you and your bitch man
Lookin' in your lobby, call me stick-man
When it's goin' down, call me quicksand
Zero to sixty in a second, pack a Smith & Weston
And if the price is right, you can be the next contestant
For this aggression, no question, M-E to the F it be flexin'
As hard as my erection, kid learn your lesson
'cause what if I decide to start testin' the joint in the muthafuckin session?
[Saukrates]
Let a nigga get into it
Lubricate y'all veins with your "Do-It" fluid
I Einstein these rymes, spit these thangs to prove it
Cross with the mac, in fact my games are truest
Now im on the highway, doing it my way
With Street the legal, Meth, Roc, and Doc friday
Performin' like the weather was warm
And drop heat on the streets through zero degree storms
And keep the ghetto, pop your metal
Smoke it like a cigarette till ya optic yellow
The addiction, aint no friction
I got them rap heads fillin' out a prescription
With diciton, they in thick, when I put fire to the stakes
And burn the arch, like a iron to your face
These long hard years spent Oxy-Cleanin' - make it clear
Look out! Big 'Sauks is here, hit the button
