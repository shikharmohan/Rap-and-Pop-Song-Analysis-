It is now 6:30 in the a.m
This is Baba Oje speaking directly to you
Right down to earth in a language
One can easily understand
We got a list of hits coming at this hour
This is WMFW FM
This hour we got Bob Marley
The sounds of Miriam Makeba, Muta Baruka
We got the live music group Gumbo coming at you this hour
We got Public Enemy's brand new sounds
We got Curtis Mayfield, we also got something coming at you
An old one from Isaac Hayes, a brand new one form Tracy Chapman
My man Paris with a brand new album
Yossour N Dour, Black Uhuru, Living Color, Vinx, Foley
Chaka Kahn, Follow 4 Now, KRS One
Queen Latifah, Stevie Wonder, Gil Scott Heron, The Last Poets
And last but not least and featuring brand-new sounds
By Arrested Development, stay tuned and good morning
