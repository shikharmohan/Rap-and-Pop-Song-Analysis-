I made a decision despite all the things that we go through
I'm gonna take more time with you and be a friend indeed
I made a decision that everything's gonna be alright
We're gonna stay strong and keep it tight, I'll be there indeed
Yes, let me talk to you
See when it feels like the sun ain't shinin' bright enough
It's like the devil's tryin' to work to give the night alone
And though I'm blessed, I still gotta handle the things I go through
It's good to have a friend with another perspective to show you
Someone you know that knows you and gives you motivation
Someone that you can go to and vent your frustrations
We always talk about our peeps, how we be everywhere
When you need 'em the most, are they really ever there?
See, everything be all good when we be havin' fun
The difference is really needin' a friend and havin' one
It's good when your peoples is there to help your problems
And help you smile about it while findin' a way to solve 'em
Look at here, let me keep it at 100 and let me tell ya
How you hold me down is somethin' I genuinely value
I got a clearer view
And bein' that you're always here for me I'm here for you
I made a decision despite all the things that we go through
I'm gonna take my time with you and be a friend indeed
I made a decision that everything's gonna be alright
Gonna stay strong and keep it tight, I'll be there indeed
Well, how you been baby? But I'm sayin'
Even though we probably link up every now and then
With minimal convo, look it's really good to see you, friend
Somethin' I realize that I don't even have to mention
Is whether or not you got me, that's somethin' that I never question
Sometimes I feel the people I love don't appreciate me
And some I hate to see the shit I've been goin' through lately
See you was here, when the shit started to haywire
You're still here, walkin' with me goin' through the fire
And I really love you for it, I know you all relate to
On everything that I believe and I appreciate you
And just for that, it don't matter you can put that on my name
The way you rep me, let me be there just for you the same
Sometimes the pressure and the pain, it be wearin' me out
But I thank you for just bein' there and for hearin' me out
I got a clearer view
I thank God that you've been there for me, I'm here for you
I made a decision despite all the things that we go through
I'm gonna take my time with you and be a friend indeed
I made a decision that everything's gonna be alright
Gonna stay strong and keep it tight, I'll be there indeed
Oh, I made a decision
I look in your eye and I see the pain in it
Life's a game, huh, maybe the game did it
I know I changed, they say that fame did it
Life is changed, huh, maybe the game did it
Two friends, now in two different places
And I'm Mr.Catchin' Planes and you catchin' cases
Friendship, we never based it on position
No matter the game, we both shared the same vision
Decisions to split us in the place that life seemed to hit us
I would come to town and never get up with you
Around then things weren't so simple
I had my own issues that I was tryin' to get through
Outside chatter, messin' with our mental
On the chase for funds to trusts, you can't forget too
It's the real friends that you got to tend to
No matter how far, you'll just know that I'm with you
I made a decision despite all the things that we go through
I'm gonna take my time with you and be a friend indeed
I made a decision that everything's gonna be alright
Gonna stay strong and keep it tight, I'll be there indeed
I made a decision, yeah, yeah
I made a decision
