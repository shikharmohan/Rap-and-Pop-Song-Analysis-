I got a '64 Chevy in my yard
A white drop top, pearl paint job is hard
White plush insides nuthin' rolls as fresh
Triple gold double-A Dayton's is the best, uh
I got them sixteen switches like Dre
Cuz where I'm from nigga that's what everybody play
UGK-1 on my mothafuckin plates
Cuz trill ass niggas don't neva roll fake
I'm bout to hit Gulfway, just past Troy's
I'm dippin by myself, I'm bout to call up my boys
I pass up the carwash see some bitches lookin fine
I hit the corner one more time to see the booty from behind
Got to the corner, hit the switch and made it jump
I got the JVC's and the gigas so it bump, unh
I know you hoe ass niggas wanna ride bitch
I got the, front back, and side to side daddy

[DJ Bird]
Tight white interior candy apple red lex bitch
Solid gold snowflakes with the honey gloss and
Tighter than a sheeps dick
Hittin the switches make the ass jump
Hood tall, solid gold true chrome jacks up the ass, wha
Smoke me the jack town mac
In a caddy six fuckin fif-two
Hittin hard than a nigga daddy
And all you hoe gettin dick, in yo back,
Goin smack from a country ass gold teeth
Chicken eatin' mac
Cuz i'm a playa that get sweet and gooshy
I take your bitch to my crib and throw a party on that pussy
And watch the niggas jock a G
Big cars, big money, big nuts, shit mo dick
Wit the smooth g ride gettin scandolous
Pussy, i dismantle it
These hoes can't handle it
Fine ass big booty bitches in my ride
Cuz the smoke got that front, that back and side to side, nigga
[Hook - x12 repeatedly]

[Bun B]
It's the Gulfway, boulevard niggas, tearin' up
All four mothafuckin corners on your block bitch,
Nothin but that bunny hop happin
High cappin, daily routine, my shit is plush
Interior crush and nigga I'm too clean, hunh
To be like the rest, I must excite the best
in your soul so letta nigga take control
And do what the fuck ya been waitin
Seein' that's me rollin on three Dayton's
We're runnin' them hoes in the air, just hangin up there
Sittin fat than a bitch, and I don't care,
I'm just puffin on red hair
Rolled in a funnel leaf, I got from lil daddy in the N.O.
And even though I wish I had some indo
But I don't give a fat fuck wit a six pack
Twelves in the trunk, chrome dip, 
Nigga don't trip, I ain't nobody's punk
Go swing down sweet rag top and let me ride
Wanna skate, baby don't wait let's glide and slide, right
[Pimp C]
Neva let hoe ass niggas ride
Neva let hoe ass niggas ride
Got front back, and side to side
Neva let hoe ass niggas ride (fading)
