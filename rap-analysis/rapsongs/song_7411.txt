Marvin, oh oh shit
Yo niggas
Wanna be all niggas
C'mon
Yo, summer time holdin' the 9, split the Vega in half
Jeeps rumble and my dogs puff grass
Bank stoppin', high-derox hydrolic
Kid with the most knowledge
Will obtain to touch top dollars
Hold me down, hand me my cake
Dusty, bake, activate, fuck these corny debates
I'm like or maybe like $10,000 rabbits
The kid walked thru, switch up his accent
Now I'm from Paris
Cash the bill, frozen element, Seagal
Signs from the most high causes me to break them all
How the fuck was y'all niggas thinkin'?
You think I fell off the ledge?
The legendary Ghost Deini might be dead?
Never, impossible, pull out black burners
Like tonsils to gallants
Hit 'em if we go to bustin' at y'all niggas daily
Wall-to-wall, Hawkins, suckin' your teeth 'cuz
God chain-talkin, like Ghostface this, Ghostface that
Ghost sold crack, now his revelations spoken thru rap
Valored down like the sheik of Iran
Gasoline cream wrapped in hospital bands
Model vans, Michael Davis it's me against housin'
Extraordinary pro-black sold God creations to control thousands
Catch me at the flicks, Apollo Rap Fredick Douglas
You know what? What Sir? Eh yo, fuck this, fuck this
How can I move the crowd?
First of all ain't no mistakes allowed
Here's the instructions put it together
It's simple ain't it? Well, quite clever
Marvin, Marvin, you were a friend of mine
You stood for somethin'
Oh Tupac, Biggie
Oh how we miss you so
We want y'all both to know
We really love you so
