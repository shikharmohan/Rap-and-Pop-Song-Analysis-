"Forty H two O, I got a few ends,
Can we do some kind of business mate?"
It depends on how much you wanna spend
And how much profit I'm gon' make
What's the crazy? Sellin' half a kezy, right now they go for eight
But you know, we in the middle of a drought playboy
So tomorrow might be too late, prices keep on elevatin'
Escalatin' and fluctuatin' like Oprah Winfrey's weight
Hesitatin', eliminatin' competitor's competition out the gate
Peruvian flake, cotton candy yams and Highway five
About an estimated four and a half hour drive, let me go
Na, na, can't do that, too dangerous, too young
Back off, it's a commotion, might even swallow your tongue
How? I'll tell ya later, hop your ass in this Kezy
Where we headed? Venice Beach little I'll be here
Gotta go pick up our greasy expo, Po, martial arts expert
Money on grip and desperate, nuttin' to be reckoned with
I tell you motherfuckers she's a fool
She sound like a fuckin' nut
Let's bust her pot, na and get the fuck
We smoke trees and slang ki's, off the fuckin' E's
Livin' life as a criminal, doin' a bunch of dirty deeds
(Look here)
We smoke trees and slang ki's, off the fuckin' E's
Livin' life as a criminal, doin' a bunch of dirty deeds
(Whatcha do?)
Doin' a bunch of dirty deeds
It ain't gon' be no cakewalk, so whatever ya do, don't talk
Others been sufficed to triangular markers with numbers on 'em
And bodies outlined in chalk
Bodies outlined in chalk, triangular markers with numbers on 'em
And bodies outlined in chalk
Call them organs, call my lawyer while you're at it
Tell my gal, get that dope up out the attic
We ism, I caught the po, po tryin' ta spoil it
Too much narcotics to be flushin' down the toilet
These bitches talkin' 'bout some shit I never knew about
Some shit I never heard, some shit that I could sue about
Knew I was in Pittsburgh, promotin' a charity concert wit my weep
And luckily a motherfucker like me
Had enough common sense to keep the receipt
Thirty fifth and room service
Buffalo wings and Bleu cheese dressing, Caesar salad
A glass of wine and lots of sexin', don't you doubt it
twenty-five percent bookworm, hundred and fifty percent street smart
Makin' business, accusations only reach a start
We smoke trees and slang ki's, off the fuckin' E's
Livin' life as a criminal, doin' a bunch of dirty deeds
(Whatcha do?)
We smoke trees and slang ki's, off the fuckin' E's
Livin' life as a criminal, doin' a bunch of dirty deeds
(Uuh)
Doin' a bunch of dirty deeds
As soon as I could walk, I'd cooked up 'bout half a meal ticket
At the age of seventeen years old, fuckin' 'em up like that
Ovulatin' in the kettle loft 'cos I kept watchin' the game
I'd fall in the yard, operation, desperation, go get your fetti
Daddy slingin' niggas, who off
In front of the liquor store tryin' to get somebody
To buy me a bottle and a pack of Newports
So that a motherfucker can up chuck on the teacher
When I get to school, restricted
So move up out of the classroom, better yet after school to diss this
Hella quick tip, wit extra manners, tie your ass up wit the phone cord
Duct tape your mouth, talk to your ass in Spanish
Describe me voice, like me, no, speak no English
Take me razorblade and get to choppin' at your fingers
Straight killers new to my squadron
My deuce don't even know that's on my squadron's back
Godzilla ballers, a juvenile with damn, man, respect
Craze up off the set, pistol whippin' negroes wit my Tek
Nina millimeter heater, heavy metal wet
Crushin' heads and snappin' necks, 'causin' nosebleeds
A one fifty percent street, nigga, about dem dirty deeds
We smoke trees and slang ki's, off the fuckin' E's
Livin' life as a criminal, doin' a bunch of dirty deeds
(Whatcha do?)
We smoke trees and slang ki's, off the fuckin' E's
