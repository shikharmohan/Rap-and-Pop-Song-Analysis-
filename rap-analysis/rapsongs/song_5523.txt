Poet: Thats my word I'm muthafucka stressed 
It seems life tryin to put me through a test 
Cause every fuckin day its just gettin worse
What first,Might go out and die hard or end up in a hearse(Pow!)
No time to think about the consequences
The years in jail, Fuck the death sentence
All I know is that I need mad cash in a flash 
Before I have to kill somebody ass 
Sittin in my room wit the lights out thinkin
