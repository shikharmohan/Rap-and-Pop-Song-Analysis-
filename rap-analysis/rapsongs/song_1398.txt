I come through stompin' in my big black boots
I keep 'em jumpin', jumpin', stayin' funky, funky for you
Whether Prada, Gucci, Versacci, my coochie drain in La Pera
Got watches like Liberacci, from my head to my stockings
I promise to rock this and keep it poppin'
Ain't no stoppin me, naw 'cuz I'm on fire like a cigarette
Get higher when the beat, quick, nigga, we hit
Shittin' on niggas to heeze on 'em just to eat quick
Recently, I've been eliminating haters hippocrits
When they see on the street with the screaming whip
It's hard to not hate, so don't even trip 'cuz I'm Chuch
If you see me when I come around, that's Chuch
Breakin' all these hoes down, that's Chuch
Got Cadillacs and Bentlys, ahh, that's Chuch
Got money to the ceiling ya'll, that's Chuch
Everywhere I go they scream, that's Chuch
Everybody say it now, that's Chuch
I'm Chuch, I'm smokin', I'm sharp, I'm hot
I'm sexy, I'm bangin', I'm sickening, I rock
I'm the hottest a hard act to follow
Never bite off more than I can chew up and swallow
If you got a problem, holla at me tomorrow
'Cuz I'm too busy bein' the leader you follow
Nigga, I'm cold blooded in a mustard color Ferrari
Somebody show love me, I hope a nigga won't come out ugly shit
I ain't buyin' 'em, that's Chuch, whatever work for you
I'm so tough that I just lay all my coo
I'm so much that I only give a little to you
And show you how these niggas up in Chi town do
If you see me when I come around, that's Chuch
Breakin' all these hoes down, that's Chuch
Got Cadillacs and Bentlys, ahh, that's Chuch
Got money to the ceiling ya'll, that's Chuch
Everywhere I go they scream, that's Chuch
Everybody say it now, that's Chuch
Like catties and furs, Chuch
House in the suburbs, Chuch
Big ass rings and chains, Chuch
Big trucks sittin' on thangs, Chuch
Daimonds and jewels, Chuch
Shining down on you fools is Chuch
Rhyming the way I do, that's Chuch
Blindin' 'em when I come through, Chuch
Bling, bling, that's right
Everything Da Brat tat tat do
You could identify that as Chuch not church
That don't mean to da flo, that's Chuch
When you got the muthafucking hat to match, nigga, that's Chuch
[Incomprehensible]
If you see me when I come around, that's Chuch
Breakin' all these hoes down, that's Chuch
Got Cadillacs and Bentlys, ahh, that's Chuch
Got money to the ceiling ya'll, that's Chuch
Everywhere I go they scream, that's Chuch
Everybody say it now, that's Chuch
If you see me when I come around, that's Chuch
Breakin' all these hoes down, that's Chuch
Got Cadillacs and Bentlys, ahh, that's Chuch
Got money to the ceiling ya'll, that's Chuch
Everywhere I go they scream, that's Chuch
Everybody say it now, that's Chuch
