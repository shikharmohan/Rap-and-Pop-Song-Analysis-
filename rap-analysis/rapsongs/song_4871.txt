Satisfaction, satisfaction, satisfaction
Satisfaction
Yeah, blow me a shotgun
B-b-blow me a shotgun
B-b-blow me a shotgun
It gives me satisfaction
Can you handle it? 808 bang in the back
With the woofer like boom boom boom boom
With my foot up on the pedal and my hand on my strap
Got the engine like vroom vroom vroom vroom
What's up? You ain't never heard a *** rap like-like this before
I got an addictive flow that'll give you satisfaction
Wanna make you satisfied, even if it kills me
Even if it takes the slower minds, a little bit of time to feel me
Recollect the 15 million I sold or the 30 times I went gold
And if you take 2 puffs of this ***, it'll give you satisfaction
I've sold the most and no one's close, but I'm not meaning to brag
It's different strokes for different folks like Angelina and Brad
Some keep the heat in the stash, put 30 keys in their Jag
And if cops ain't peepin' your tag, you're gonna feel some satisfaction
Pumpin' out albums like Reverend Run is pumpin' out children
Here's another one
So catch me on more 24's than Kiefer Sutherland
I'm bound to be the greatest, I'm determined to win
Until then I can't get no satisfaction
Yeah, blow me a shotgun
B-b-blow me a shotgun
B-b-blow me a shotgun
It gives me satisfaction
I'm the one that went to the gunfight with a knife and won
Left with his *** and left him dead [Incomprehensible] he tried to run
Just because my verse second, don't mean I am not the one
When I'm done, I'm guaranteed to give you satisfaction
I might not be the best in the world but the best the world's ever seen
I'm all been in Georgia's daughter Conde *** king
And when I'm diggin' deep in the spleen
I'ma make her *** and she scream
Baby, get me *** like a Snickers bar, I give her satisfaction
Yes sir, there ain't not other way, so mother*** what you say
Y'all had this spot, we took you off the top like a toupee
Your coast, we kicked and pushed in this Fiasco like Lupe
Back that *** up like Juve 'cause the South
We givin' them satisfaction
Ever since I signed with Luda and them, my chances of losin' are slim
Y'all talk that smack but copycat and do a movie like him
Yes sir, my Mobb got that goodie, as if my group had a gift
We gonna continue to give them a double dose of satisfaction
Yeah, blow me a shotgun
B-b-blow me a shotgun
B-b-blow me a shotgun
It gives me satisfaction
Drop the bomb, when I rhyme, it's TNT
That's why my money long as the line at the DMV
When they askin' who was that that was snappin'
I'm that answer dude, you like Snickers with no nuts no satisfaction
I hustle and flow, I done been by my cheese since I was knee high
*** what you need, hit me, I'ma drop off peaches like I'm T.I.
Earvin Johnson, gimme that rock and magic cap of Shawn Jay
*** sold money for satisfaction
I been the ***, they can't *** with, hot but the flow cold
Flip *** by the boatload, O.G. no see, see me
Get tipped off, getcha no dough
Zip-loc full of *** tow big *** on the hip cocked
Try to play the big shots, get popped with the ***
Don't be the reason they mopped in the floor for
Pay me that satisfaction
Fool for a dollar let me get that pop, man, I need this cream
Where my cake? Give me my candles, I got sweet sixteen
Now the kid with the *** flow got DTP on his necklace
Now Luda, tell them what you think about your invest
Yeah, blow me a shotgun
B-b-blow me a shotgun
B-b-blow me a shotgun
It gives me satisfaction
Yeah, blow me a shotgun
B-b-blow me a shotgun
B-b-blow me a shotgun
It gives me satisfaction
