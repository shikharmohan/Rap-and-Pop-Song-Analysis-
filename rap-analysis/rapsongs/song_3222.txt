Nigga, you need to stop snitchin'
All that yip-yappin' and jaw-jackin'
Nigga, if you scared, go to church
You knew the job was dangerous when you took it
What up? It's the big boss Dogg
Snoop D O double G, East side L.B.C.
And I'm bobbin to the beat of my O.G. homeboy Ice Cube
And I'm C-walkin' on the motherfuckin' concrete
Yo, if you're fucked up, put your cups up

You don't really wanna have a clash with my team

If I got a bitch with me, she got ass in them jeans
Rollin' through yo' neighborhood, my Cadillac so clean
