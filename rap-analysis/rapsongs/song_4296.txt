[Intro] 
Yeah 
Aye blackstar (Weezy,weezy,weezy baby) 
DK 
Yeah 
It's another one 
It's official 
Girl what you trippin for?
[Verse 1] 
He knew from the start 
He had me all sprung 
I had no choice to touch him 
He had that edge 
The way he worked me 
He had me open 
I could tell he was trouble 
My girls told me that he was not the one 
Plus my mama don't trust him 
When he touched me 
All the warnings, they just blew past me 
I know that he is trouble
[Hook] 
Gotta find a way to get through this 
This dude is killing me 
Got me caught trapped up in the game 
No, there's no way to free me 
And I'm playing the fool because I know he's no good
[Chorus] 
That's why it's just a phase 
That that I'm goin through 
A shame 
That he got me breaking all my rules 
Got me tripping 
Don't know what to do 
They say it's just a phase 
That that I'm goin through 
A shame 
That he got me breaking all my rules 
Got me tripping 
Don't know what to do 
They say it's just a phase
[Verse 2] 
Everytime Ii think 
I got strength to leave 
i pack my bags 
(tell my girl) come get me 
he's on his knees 
makin promises that he can't keep 
and then i believe him 
i thought i was stronger than this 
a southern girl 
with southern dreams 
but he could see 
thought he knew me
[Hook]

That's why it's just a phase 
That that I'm goin through

Don't know what to do 
They say it's just a phase 
That that I'm goin through 
A shame 
That he got me breaking all my rules 
Got me tripping 
Don't know what to do

[Verse 3-(Lil Wayne)] 
Uh-uh I'ma lil bit more than that 
Shawty I'm so hot ima make u bring yo oven back 
And I'm fly call me Firebird Pontiac 
Dark, rich, and strong like cognac 
What's yo zodiac, see me I be a libra 
And I do everything twice so I eat her, eat her 
I need her, need her yeah its jacida's son 
With a tongue like a 9 milimeter gun 
And we don't need a gun, because we keep peace 
Tylenol p.m. sex, now she sleep 
Shhhhhhh, see I just put her to bed, to bed, to bed 
Now I'ma rock yo body, turn you ova, smell me like some burnin' rollers 
In the mornin' turn you ova, while you yawning bend you ova 
Feel like heaven, I know baby 
See this just I know baby 
See he could be yo phase, but I know he can't phase me

[Bridge] 
*I have no clue what she is saying*
[Chorus] 
That's why it's just a phase 
That that I'm goin through 
A shame 
That he got me breaking all my rules 
Got me tripping 
Don't know what to do 
They say it's just a phase 
That that I'm goin through 
A shame 
That he got me breaking all my rules 
Got me tripping 
Don't know what to do 
They say it's just a phase
