Yo nigga your moma got two feet growin' out of titties
Bitch fell down and kept runnin'
Off to the studio late night
It's time to cut another track
It's gotta be hype got my rhyme book in hand
A blue loose leaf
Anybody moves on that they get loose teeth
Evil's got the funky beat a stupid dope loop
But the record's kind of old
What we gonna do troop?
We gotta clean it up 'cause it's so dope
Tried the rubbin' alcohol even the ivory soap
But no matter what we do the record keeps clickin'
Fuck it
Yo, you give me some of that damn fried chicken
Oh yea, oh yea, this sound kinda nice man alright
Definitely go for it
I think niggaz gonna give a crack on it which he uses, right
You fucked it yea
Everybody do it out
My heart is going down
