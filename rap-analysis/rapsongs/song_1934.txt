Man, are you for real?
Can't be f*** serious
You not for real, you gotta be playin'
You better walk away, c'mon
I run s*** here, y'all just sit here
Do y'all n*** know what it took for me to get here?
I'm gonna stay here, earn my way here
You can f*** around if you want but we don't play here
We gets through that, run right through that
That's how we do that, y'all *** knew that
Two albums in one year, three albums in two
Didn't I just c'mon tell y'all n*** that's how we do?
You wasn't even *** listenin' when I just said
What I said, you get that, what I just said
I run s*** here, y'all ***
Jail, what I said, I used to duck y'all
Grown and that's all to it
God bless His child on His own and I'm gonna do it
I done did it
You ain't even half way close to bein' with it forget it
I run s***, I run s*** here
I run s***, I run s*** here
I run s*** here, I run s***
I run s*** here, I run s***
I run s***, I run s*** here
I run s***, I run s*** here
I run s*** here, I run s***
I run s*** here, I run s***
I run s*** here, what's my name?
Gettin' down for real, *** my fame
Played too many games and the game's gone catch up with you
Fames'll make stretcha catch up with you quicka
You that c'mon, oh, for real you that aight
Let me show you how we do that
You see, y'all cats are small cats
And *** like us aren't gonna believe that
We takin' all that, fall back
Get down, lay down, sit down
Stay down, head round, hey now
Does a *** wanna get a little off his mind?
I'm a *** that will hit a *** off his time
Go off his spine, brains in the air
Flames to the hair 'cause the game ain't fair
And I'll take it there, with the right one, baby
Got that, we tryin' to light one, baby
I run s***, I run s*** here
I run s***, I run s*** here
I run s*** here, I run s***
I run s*** here, I run s***
I run s***, I run s*** here
I run s***, I run s*** here
I run s*** here, I run s***
I run s*** here, I run s***
I've done s*** here, my guns spit here
Y'all might live here but I run s*** here
Blood, sweats and tears for years just to sit here
Think I'm about to let you *** get here?
Cowards are stupid, if you wanna see me prove it
Try and take my position, watch how quick a *** lose it
Make you get all my s*** and have you fearin' for your life
Every time you see me roll up or ride up on a bike
Dressed in all black with my pistol in your sight
But it will be my man in all white that walks up with a knife
I'm a big boy, baby I don't play with you thin
Gettin' my hands dirty, when there's beef, I send
I run s***, I run s*** here
I run s***, I run s*** here
I run s*** here, I run s***
I run s*** here, I run s***
I run s***, I run s*** here
I run s***, I run s*** here
I run s*** here, I run s***
I run s*** here, I run s***
