Swizz beats
Nigga, ryde or die
DMX what, what, what
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my flow
Ain't no way ya niggaz you just don't know
But niggaz is about to go, oh no, oh no
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my shine
Ain't no way you niggaz wanna stop mine
Ya niggaz must be out yo mind, I don't know why
Now what the fuck is you niggaz pressin' me for?
I saw more ass than a hoe and you stressin' the raw
If I was testin' your jaw, maybe then you would respect me
But you can't respect me 'cuz you don't even know me nigga check me
I'm that motherfucker that'll put you to sleep, while you sleepin'
Then die from a hundred feet, you just knew you was creepin'
Bad decisions lead to last decisions
Fast collision, now yo ass is missin'
Take it over there now you bring it back to the streets
Have you forgotten what it means when a dog shows his teeth?
Let me break it down for you he's about to attack you
Still standin' here faggot? You must want me to smack you
You ain't been there or done that, fuck is y'all niggaz tellin' me
I'm the only nigga, walkin' the streets with four felonies
But peep this, I see shit is hard, niggaz is strugglin'
Leave rap alone for a little while, go back to hustlin'
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my flow
Ain't no way ya niggaz you just don't know
But niggaz is about to go, oh no, oh no
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my shine
Ain't no way you niggaz wanna stop mine
Ya niggaz must be out yo mind, I don't know why
Give it to niggaz just how they give it to, me
Hit 'em in a rhyme because I'm an MC
Been a lot of places most niggaz won't, see
That's why I'm at a level that y'all niggaz won't, be
Let your man hold somethin' now he want, more
You ain't no fuckin' killer what was the front, for
It was a time when the world was at your front, door
Now they change places, niggaz want, raw
Niggaz laughed at me and was mad at me
'Cuz the way life was goin' had to be a, tragedy
But after me, it's over, I'ma take the whole verse
I'm tryin' to keep it real that's why I let y'all niggaz go first
But you looked a gift horse right in the mouth, didn't appreciate
What you got when you got it, so if I see it, I'ma dot it, where to hide it
You gotta car better drive it the fuck up outta here
And hope and pray I don't pull up alongside it, come on
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my flow
Ain't no way ya niggaz you just don't know
But niggaz is about to go, oh no, oh no
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my shine
Ain't no way you niggaz wanna stop mine
Ya niggaz must be out yo mind, I don't know why
Niggaz don't know so I gotta flip
It seem they've forgotten how dark it could get
Barks like a pit, scratch when I hit
We both know you pussy but you stay talkin' shit
What I'ma have to do dog, run up in yo mess
Catch you while you comfortable put one up in yo chest
One up in yo vest, of course they the hollows
You goin' away today, you just lost tomorrow
I'ma go platinum you gots to be kiddin' why
Make it double platinum, no bullshittin'
And I'ma stay flippin' flows, rippin' shows
Strippin' ho's, gettin' dough let me go
And nigaz know, who the best is the dog, DMX is
The rest is or might as well be helpless, I wreck this
'Cuz when I wreck shit, I might snatch a niggaz necklace
Then go from like midnight to breakfast, come on
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my flow
Ain't no way ya niggaz you just don't know
But niggaz is about to go, oh no, oh no
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my shine
Ain't no way you niggaz wanna stop mine
Ya niggaz must be out yo mind, I don't know why
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my flow
Ain't no way ya niggaz you just don't know
But niggaz is about to go, oh no, oh no
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my shine
Ain't no way you niggaz wanna stop mine
Ya niggaz must be out yo mind, I don't know why
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my flow
Ya niggaz you just don't know
But niggaz is about to go, oh no, oh no
Way you're gonna stop my shine
You niggaz wanna stop mine
You must be out of your motherfucking mind
I love it, I love it
