It's one in the mornin'
You know what time it is
It's one in the mornin'
It's one in the mornin'
You gonna have come out your clothes on this one
Yeah I'm still at it, the microphone addict
You get your dome splattered, cause homie will not have it
Your ashes get scattered across the Atlantic
For actin' like you a teenage chick with her bra padded
You might laugh at it, but if you do the knowledge
It's really a tad tragic how they runnin' through they cabbage
You know my track record, L battle like a savage
I think and grow rich, that gives me the advantage
Uncle L L, I got product for sale
So I can bail Al Sharpton out of jail
Somebody gotta do it, somebody in the black community
Gotta get this money while y'all march for unity
So march on, I'ma get my Bentley park on
Then get my dogs a platform to bark on
The realest brother, you Nicole Kidman, one of the others
Children shiverin' under the covers
The man in black, the tilted fedora hat
I'm bringin' it raw, you never want your money back
I'm focused baby, livin' like a quarterback
Playin' in the wishbone, L keep options black
Systematically, burn you like calories
Watch your mouth, go earn your lil' salary
I'm a classic like Nike Airs and wallabies
You could catch it like the flu, homie follow me
It's one in the mornin', flash the dough
It's one in the mornin', crack the mo'
It's one in the mornin', get on the flo'
It's one in the mornin', who wanna go?
That's right sleeping beauty, wake up see the light
That Tylenol P M got you caught for your B M
Everybody can see, I'm the king of rippin' coliseums
C'mon, use a male groupie beggin' for per diem
A fruitcake laid out in the mausoleum
I'm the richest man in Babylon, nobody could see him
Money's my slave, it do what I say
It cry for me, like Denzel in glory
But I broke the cycle, no more poverty
I wonder if you hatin' on the low, probably
But cats know I'm real, I keep 'em on they heels
Damn, look at my body, could have been a navy seal
But you lack the discipline to do what I do
Reinvention, I'm in the eleventh dimension
I'm a value stock pop, get it while it's hot
'Cause once I blow, I'ma split and that's it
It's one in the mornin', flash the dough
It's one in the mornin', crack the mo'
It's one in the mornin', get on the flo'
It's one in the mornin', who wanna go?
It's one in the mornin', flash the dough
Aiyyo E's, it's one o'clock
It's one in the mornin', crack the mo'
Time to get one and bounce baby
It's one in the mornin', get on the flo'
It's time to get one and bounce, you know what time it is?
It's one in the mornin', who wanna go?
Your honor, last week he punched me in my face
I want twenty million, you know he liftin' weights
Last week, me and the President was takin' flicks
Last week, my video dropped and you was sick
Last week, I copped my lil' shorty some kicks
That cost twenty nine hundred, homie you don't want it
My ears stay flooded like your man stay blunted
My American Express is black, I'm at the summit
The Benjamin Grier of Def Jam, y'all know
My portfolio was sicker than polio
For real God is good, he took me out the hood
Got me livin' in a mansion like a big boy should
And I never do cribs, I ain't gonna have y'all fruitcakes
Knowin' how I live, bed extra big
You sit around, run your mouth, potbelly on the couch
Claimin' you hot but honey what you wove out
When she alone, pump l, I make her bounce
You on the corner riskin' your life to sell a ounce
Wish you was Pablo, lay in the carbo
With a chick named Margo who flew from Chicago
But no, in real life cats catch it
It's not what you expected huh? Life kinda hectic huh?
It's one in the mornin', flash the dough
It's one in the mornin', crack the mo'
It's one in the mornin', get on the flo'
It's one in the mornin', who wanna go?
It's one in the mornin', flash the dough
It's one in the mornin', crack the mo'
It's the definition
It's one in the mornin', get on the flo'
Definition
It's one in the mornin', go
Definition potna, eleven in a row
