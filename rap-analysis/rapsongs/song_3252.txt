It's been a long time since I hit you with freestyle
High tech selections from the vaults of the ice files
Kick back relax and watch as I melt wax
Don't ever let a brother like me
Ride a dope track
'Cause once I hit it with the Vocltone It's mine
Have motherfuckers rushn' to rewind
'Cause I'll flow slow
And still twist your tongues up
Rock the house from night
Till the sun's up
'Cause it really ain't how much you say
It's what you say I got no fuckin' time on the mic to play
I write rhymes with addition and algebra
Mental geometry don't even come at me
Talk'n that weak and popin' that bullshit
Get out my face a fool could get his head split
A lot of doubters said it couldn't be done by me
Them same suckers are now lookin' from under me
Wondern' what I did? I didn't play myself kid
I respected my fans and made the high bid
Sometimes I write my rhymes at night and fall asleep
Wake up with new techniques
Grab the pen and place it on some loose leaf
Nothin' soft, always the tough meat
The white paper and blue lines excite my mind
Not allown' me to stop the rhyme
Until the whole motherfuckin' book's complete
Then I write on the back of the sheets
I made promise to my brothers in street crime
We'd get paid with the use of a sweet rhyme
We put our minds together made the tracks clever
Now we're checkin' more bank than ever
Mind over matter
So you gotta have mind Pale
Like your brother say
Mind over matter
I can drop rhymes in two and threes and fours
I'd still have much shit left for encores
'Cause once my mind locks in on a dope idea
Mothercukin' ducks should stand clear
'Cause I'm a hit the topic point blank
It's jail ya better keep your shank
'Cause I got mine and I'm out on a solo creep
Your face hits the concrete
You wanna roll with the niggas that don't play
I think you got false courage get out my damn way
'Cause the car I'm in is rollin' full of men
No kids or boys, E got the mac ten
Islam's got the Zulu nation back up
DJ Aladdin's who hooked the fuckin' track up
Syndicate's maken' the move with the ski mask
And I'm house'n the long cash
So now you realize you underestimated the ice
You thought that I was ok but now you realize I'm nice
But that's alright 'cause I knew I'd make it in the end
Those who like me now might not of liked me then
But I'm a keep impressin' stressin' my lesson
And keep motherfuckers guessin'
Armor plate my mind with walls and shields
As I escape from the killing fields
I can understand
Mind over matter
I know what it mean
Mind over matter
Mind over matter
Mind over matter
Mind over matter
Wise up move the tempo of this hype groove
You know this shit is dope
So what you try'n to prove
Vu's max as Evil E
My niggaa dogs the wax
My brain's a handgrenade catch
I'm a hit you with an over load
Of bottomless thought
Reversin' all the shit you're taught
Then throw words at you
Syllable at a time
Your brain recites the rhyme
No matter what you do the power's over you
When you sleep you'll be say'n these rhymes too
'Cause the brain has the power to control all
Think positive you'll be unable to fall
Brain cells swell thought process becomes a trance
Makes you feel possessed to dance
I'll say I want a million my mind is so deep
I'll be bustin' a check for it next week
Like your brother say
Mind over matter
I know what it mean
Mind over matter
