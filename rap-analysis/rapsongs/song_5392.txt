I know some of y'all sick of songs
Y'all be hearin' on the radio
So me and Timbaland gon' give that shit
You never heard before
It's like drinkin' liquor or weed
Or X, whatever does you the best
My beats are so addictive
C'mon get krunk with me
See if you're ridin' down the street
And you're 'bout to roll that shit up
You don't need drugs or weed
Oh, nah, you ain't smokin' that stank shit up in my car
Get your feet off my dashboard
C'mon get krunk with me
Oh, yeah, you wanna get krunk though?
Well pop this CD in right here and take a hit of me
'Coz my album is so addictive
Man, bump this ballad shit
