Hear my jam with the funky piano
Hear my jam with the funky piano
Hear my jam with the funky piano
Hear my jam with the funky piano
Straight from Brooklyn, from out the projects
It's DJ Scratch, so girls fix your Kotex
The Ruler, not Slick Rick but the ruler on the mix
With ten or more tricks, take flicks
Prick, but please don't miss this
Watch my DJ cut with his dick, yeah
Slick ain't it? See your mom's fainted
Technique 1200 and watch Scratch train it
I'ma step off and let Scratch collect dough
While you hear my jam with the funky piano
Hear my jam with the funky piano
Hear my jam with the funky piano
Hear my jam with the funky piano
Hear my jam with the funky piano
Here with the movement of his hands
Who is the best? Me, stop lying, go ask her mother
Who is the best? Me, stop lying, go ask her mother
Who is the best? Me, stop lying, go ask her mother
Who is the best? Me, stop lying, go ask her mother
A brief description, yeah bust my DJ on the mix
No line switch, two transform cuts with his lips
And feeds up and down is extra weak
He strictly cross fades club mixes every week
Won't break a sweat, the man's sharp on the blade
Real name George Spivey, sports a high-top fade
Brothers starin' shocked while the brother is rockin'
No arrows on the record or marks or needle poppin'
From table to table, sports a Gucci cable
EPMD's the group, Def Jam is the label
Now I'ma step off while Scratch collects his dough
Or rock a funky scratch to the funky piano
Hear my jam with the funky piano
Hear my jam with the funky piano
Hear my jam with the funky piano
Hear my jam with the funky piano
Here with the movement of his hands
Who is the best? Me, stop lying, go ask her mother
Who is the best? Me, stop lying, go ask her mother
Who is the best? Me, stop lying, go ask her mother
Who is the best? Me, stop lying, go ask her mother
Good God, good God, good God, good God
