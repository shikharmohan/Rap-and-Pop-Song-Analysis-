Ay yo Missy, fuck that
I just came out here a hour and twenty five minutes
On one of them Gilligan island shits of New York, Virginia
Word up! Came out here to visit your ass
And you playin' shit like this up in my ears
Fuck you think you doin' thinkin'
I ain't gonna get on this mother fucker before I bounce
Yo check this out, let me hit you with this shit real quick Missy
One shot baby, just let me do my shit
For a minute on your shit
Check it out, I continue to disregard all of ya'lls opinion
Blast your whole ass into oblivion, makin' New York with virgin-akins
This shit be baggin', if you disagree
Before I smoke this and get a little drunk and get a little pissy
When I finish my music, I'ma make all ya'll
[Incomprehensible] motherfuckers miss me
See who is he, you see that girl right there, who is she?
Busta Ryhmes and Missy
Niggaz come around Missy, don't act like a fuckin' sissy
