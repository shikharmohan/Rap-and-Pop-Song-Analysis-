Thanks to jostmatt@bluewin.ch for these lyrics.   Nobody ever said life was gon' be easy But damn.. [ VERSE 1 ] Just a kid, moms died when I was seven Pops died, eleven, what's up with heaven? It's hell when you're an orphan at a early age This impressionable stage, no love breeds rage Parkin Caddies on the sidewalk, gangsta talk In the heart of a child who never knew his roots Looked up to pimps and to hustlers in the eel-skin boots Truckin diamonds and gold Rubberbands around the bankrolls Fly girls to make your head spin Seemed they partied all night long But they said, "Little fellow, run and go play I was like, "Put me on" Take your butt to school or else you'll have to be like us one day" While all the players got the girls cause they'd hustle and rob I didn't understand, but I tried to get a job I was like makin 'bout 1-50 a week And after taxes, you know what that is - lunch meat  And I know I can be better than this I gotta get me a car, man I gotta get a girl  I'm finna go for it, man I know I can do it out there, man I gotta get some money Word  Streets of anger, trouble and crime [ VERSE 2 ] I had it hard, had to sleep in my car sometime But I never let another player see me down Even when checkin minor green I kept my front up, my gear clean Brothers knew my game was true So I hooked up with the real crew That knew excactly what to do Bank jobs and jewels, quick to flex with tools Pimpin hoes on the block Checkin cash non-stop Crack spots, armor with interior bars No lie, I used to own 'bout 15 cars Every piece Fila made Drape my women in suede It was on, crazy out of control Pavet Piaget, Cesar's Palace holidays But the FBI had a-whole-nother idea We made up the word 'ballin', that was how we rolled It's called multiple indictments for hundreds of years  What Daff is dead? Carter got 25 years? Nah.. Spike 35 to life? Nah, don't tell me B.O.'s dead, man I don't wanna hear that, man I was just with him  The game is vicious, no retirement, you die young [ VERSE 3 ] Listen to a fake, he might tell you to grab a gun I get phone calls from condemned row They tell me, "Ice you got much love in the pen Brothers I ran with, brothers I really know You're the one that got away, don't wanna see you in" They tell me, "Tell the little homies the deal I marched two million strong in D.C. Don't let em come up in this hellish habitat of shanks and steel" Damn, my mind was twisted in my hustlin days Lookin eye to eye with brothers that I used to think below me And bein black ain't easy, prejudice is real But God spared me, I got a baby son to raise But health and liberty is all we need for us to build We gotta come together, unseparated Check yourself like I did, blackman, because we're all related
