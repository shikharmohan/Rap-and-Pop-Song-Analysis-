Take it down now
I loved hard one but the love wasnt in return
I found out the man i die for he wasnt even concerned
Time will turn you tried to burn like a perm
But my eyes saw the deception but ma' heart couldnt let me learn
For, some little mug was i
Every time he lied he would cry and then id die
My heart must of died a thousand deaths
Compare my self to Tony Braxton thought id never catch my breate
Nothing left you stole the heart beating from my chest
I tried to call the cops that type of thing they cant arrest
Pay supressed will lead to cardiac arrest
I must deserve it cus' he convinced me i was not blessed
But my people would protest told the line of buisness cus' ma s**t was complex
Mornings just a sex i was blessed but couldnt feel it like when i was caressed 
I spent nights touching my breast overwhelmed by gods zest
I was god bleesed contimplating destistating mess
And no man has ever worked in paradise, no man has ever worked in paradise, And no man has ever worked in paradise
Where were you when i needed you, when i needed you, when i needed you
Where were you when i needed you, when i needed you, when i needed you
oh do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do
