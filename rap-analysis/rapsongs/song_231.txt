                              Verse 1 (50 Cent)
Gangsta with bitches. Niggas can't fuck with my Riches. I beat you if I find you Fuckin with my bitches. I beat you if you with some snitches. Ricky Ross ain't no gangsta. Weezey ain't no gangsta. Kiyeezey ain't no gangsta. Them some wanksta. I'm a gangsta cause you can't jock my shit. Lately I ain't made no hit. I carry my gun with me. I'm like Jhon Cena, Ya'll can't see me. Em found me and trained my style. My gun was full but now whats full is my file. When I made candy shop i was hip. But when I made I get money ya'll flip. Now I'm back and ya'll be pissed. But who's up next Jadakiss.

                          Verse 2 (Jadakiss) 
Be by my side. I'ma let them gangstas ride. Don't fuck with the westside. That's how one of my niggas died. I'm from the hood. The gangsta life is good.
