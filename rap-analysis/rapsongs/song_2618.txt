Uhh
Guess who's back uhh
Yeah, uhh
Aiyyo rhyme or crime, let's get it on
MC's wanna eat me but it's Ramadan
Peep what's on the arm, when it's ice it's ice
When I'm right, I'm right, when you're wrong, you're wrong
I'm the bomb, records is platinum, skin is bronze
Flows all night like vintage dom
Been this nice since the first Prince Bomb
Before the artist was known as wit my grown ass
Haters said it won't last, know how many birds I flown past
Celly on roam, full belly, first class
And I don't play, I watch them pockets
Know y'all niggaz go broke after you cop them watches
See you in the club, no bub' nigga pop it
Then you wanna fuck, give it up nigga, not this
My coat is ostrich, flow is the hottest
You ain't got dough, you can't go with the fox bitch
You can catch me at the hot spot 'cause I fox, I plots
At the bar y'all, all night, I pops
Is it alright, sho' you right, you can't stop it
This is our world, me and my girls
You can catch me at the hot spot, I fox, I plots
At the bar y'all, all night, I pops
Is it alright, sho' you right, you can't stop it
This is our world, me and my girls
Yo cats bustin' out the six, cash flushin' out the niggaz
Platinum heart in half hangin' 'tween the two tit ties
Scheme on your team, lookin' over graph pictures
Pick the finest, then I put it on the minors
Love, after the club, meet me at the diner
So you can bring your boys, we got ten cars behind us
Order a steak, a glass of OJ to breakfast
Hop in the car and head straight up Eighth Ave
The night is young, I'm likin' son
Either he don't have one, or his wife is dumb
His whole hand numb, nigga iced his thumb
Pull up my tights some, enticin' him
You can handle the work, I'll play wit it
Till he curve and swerve nigga, stay wit it
Bitches in the clubs they, hated it
'Cause I put my mack down then I, skated it
You can catch me at the hot spot 'cause I fox, I plots
At the bar y'all, all night, I pops
Is it alright, sho' you right, you can't stop it
This is our world, me and my girls
You can catch me at the hot spot, I fox, I plots
At the bar y'all, all night, I pops
Is it alright, sho' you right, you can't stop it
This is our world, me and my girls
You can catch me at the Expo', Jacob Jav
Knocking jigga out the Navigator, laying' back, I stay in that
Me fallin' off imagine that, it's not the case
I'm sittin' on top of the world like Brandy and Mase
You wanna, buy me a drink, nigga hand me a case
Big ballin' bitch, I want all of this shit
Six AMG's with the spoiler kit
Chromes from the fac', phones front and back
Co Co, flow, niggaz is wantin' that
Out they vehicles, niggaz is bumpin' that
I heard you wanna stop fox, tell me how so
I got that New York, to the Dirty South Flow
Whole album hot, even the outro
This time around I'm tryin' to do about fo'
This is for my niggaz and bitches who count dough
And y'all in the club I make em bounce
You can catch me at the hot spot 'cause I fox, I plots
At the bar y'all, all night, I pops
Is it alright, sho' you right, you can't stop it
This is our world, me and my girls
You can catch me at the hot spot, I fox, I plots
At the bar y'all, all night, I pops
Is it alright, sho' you right, you can't stop it
This is our world, me and my girls
Hot spot
Bar y'all
Alright
Our world
Hot spot
Bar y'all
Alright
Our world
