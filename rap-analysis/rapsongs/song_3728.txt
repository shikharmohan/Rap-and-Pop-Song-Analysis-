Yeah, yeah, let's switch the flow up a little
Word, bring the love back, here we go
You ever lost somebody
A member of your party
Your daddy, maybe mommy?
For them there was no copy
Just know that we all asleep
Pray to the Lord my soul will keep
Life is a dream no need to weep
God's gonna wake us up from sleep
Every night we die, we practice for death
Every time we sleep, we say goodbye
But I still can't get over the fact
That my best friend's awake and not comin' back
So as the tears
  (Tears roll from my eyes, yeah)
Uhh, uhh, I never got a chance to say
(Good-bye)
Trouble MC, Scott Larock
Paul Sea, Doctor Rock
Mastadon, Trouble T-Roy, Aaliyah
Cowboy, Sugar Shaft, Eazy-E
(Got to say good-bye)
Yeah, bring the love back
Bring the love back
When you wake up
Then you'll know, what was up
You won't live, so corrupt
Only love, you'll take up
All the chasin' and rushin'
Impatience and fussin'
The racin' for somethin'
The hatin' and frontin' is makin' you nothin'
So die before you die
So when you die you don't die
You got to die before you die
So when you die you don't die
You got to die to all the world
All the guys and the girls
You got to die to lovin' money
And them diamonds and pearls
So as the tears
  (Tears roll from my eyes, yeah)
I never got a chance to say to y'all
(Good-bye)
Prince Messiah, Bigga B
Freaky Tah, B.I.G
Big Pun, Mercury, June Bug
Buffy, Tupac, Darryl C
(Got to say good-bye)
Bring the love back
Bring the love back, uhh, hip-hop
So remember when they die
They have only woke up
It's our wants and our needs
That be chokin' us up
(And I want and I need
And I want and I need)
Yo, there was a time
When hip-hop was on our mind
It wasn't about no crime
Just reality rhymes
If you battled me fine
But in the end we reclined
With a bottle of wine
MC's the original kind but
(Why did you stray?)
Hip-hop
(Why did you stray?)
Hip-hop
(Why did you stray?)
Hip-hop
(Why did you stray?)
Bring the love back
(Why did you stray?)
Bring the love back
(Why did you stray?
Why did you stray?)
(Why did you stray?)
Rise up y'all
(Why did you stray?)
Remember where you came from
(Why did you stray?)
Bring the love back
(Why did you stray?)
