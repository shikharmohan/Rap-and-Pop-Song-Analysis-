because in a way, God is everything, yaknowhatI'msayin?  He he he workin
through them crackers to save us, in a sense, knowhatI'msayin?  The evil
that they do.  I mean he made the devil, you understand whatI'msayin?
So the evil that they do it it, I mean knowhatI'msayin, it's only
supposed to bring something outta us in a way, ya understand, so is it
bad, understand whatI'msayin?  Is it bad that they are the way they are
because it it it's helping us it's it's opening our eyes to some things,
