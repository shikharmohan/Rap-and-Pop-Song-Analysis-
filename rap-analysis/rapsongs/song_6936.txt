Yeah, this is the best part of the trip
Hold on to something, hold on to something
We about to take the road less traveled
You ain't gotta go home, but you can't stay here
Let's go
I get lonelier each time
You go away I lose my mind
I lay awake 'til you come and make things right
(Yeah, yeah)
I get lonelier each time you go away
(C'mon)
So baby won't you stay with me tonight?
(Yeah)
Check it out
There's this lady I'm in love with
(Yes, there is)
Living inside this woman unknown
But she's scared to let it show
I know it sound like some bug shit
(Yeah, it do)
It's just she come with
Hang ups and insecurities they gotta go
She always nervous around me but see this lady inside
She's ready to be my baby tonight and ever since this lady found me
This woman think I'm dangerous
And ain't ready to put her safety aside
I try to tell her that I got her back
And no matter where we at, in our lives
I'll treat her like she my girl
I asked her "What's wrong with dat?"
(What's wrong with dat?)
She like "It just ain't right
There's so many more women and men in the world"
I have to admit the girl got a point
(True)
Maybe my ambition's made to make me want something
I just can't have, so now it's time for me to blow this joint
I still know I'm in love, I just stay focused
And true to my path, word
I get lonelier each time
You go away I lose my mind
I lay awake 'til you come and make things right
(Yeah, yeah)
I get lonelier each time you go away
(Uh)
So baby won't you stay with me tonight?
(Yeah, yeah)
I got to get away
Ladies you ever felt growing away
By your man, asking "Baby, won't you stay?"
He chilling with his crew, he should be building with you
He got you feeling the blues, 'cause the children to glue
He willing to do whatever it takes, to save 'em
From a fate he can't see when he misbehaving
Brave men don't let they ladies raise they children theyself
You're so busy trying to save 'em, that you you're killing yourself
With the stress and strife and the fights and the advice
From the ladies of the night, who can't run they own life
Up in your air, nothing is fair
Why do you care? Why do you always take it there?
The crying, the tears, you ain't prepared for the jewels
That I'm trying to share, flying there
Dying inside, hot in the fear, the writing is clear on the wall
For you to read the sign, ayo, the fine is the way we design
To be fine but still
I get lonelier each time
(I get so lonely)
You go away I lose my mind
I lay awake 'til you come and make things right
(Mm, make it right, make it right, make it right)
I get lonelier each time you go away
(la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
So baby won't you stay with me tonight?
Gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go
  (Baby don't go)
Gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go
  (Baby don't go)
Gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go
  (Baby don't go)
Gotta, Gotta
Gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go
  (Baby don't go)
Gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go
  (Baby don't go)
Gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go
  (Baby don't go)
Gotta, Gotta
Yo, you can tell when people wanna spend they life together
Despite the weather
They treat each other like a treasure
Can't fight forever, you got to give it up
I ain't got a lot of time, we got to live it up
I make my music like I make my love
People use it like they take they drugs
In the morning when they wakin' up
This music got me out late but
I holla at you when I'm done, don't stay up
Will love play with us? It sting like paper cuts
Doused in alcohol, but if it's real
They ain't no greater rush, I got faith in us
It's only you who really know me
I be surrounded by people and still feel lonely
So baby won't you stay
  (Why won't you stay?)
Baby won't you stay?
  (Why won't you stay?)
Baby won't you stay with me tonight?
  (Oh)
Stay with me tonight
Stay with me tonight
Oh, c'mon
