L.T., Uh, The nerve of this b***h
(Tray Deee)
A b***h made purpose is to service a mac
In a skirt till her feet hurt workin trap
No breaks, ho break mine or she don't sleep
Pussy just a piece of meat another means to eat
b***hes playin like the wayin so I stay in the game
Pimpin hard on these niggaz 'cause they playin is lame
How i'm came at a ho is all a b***h gone know
What I won't, what I don't and where to put my dough
Back-talk get you slapped broad stay in yo place
I might get the hanger then make you lay on yo face
Trick guerilla for my scrilla ho you got to know
Chronic weed smoke the only thing I cop to blow
Gangsta-playa paper-chasin break a b***h like young
No tongue get em sprung from the game I run
One in a million with this pimpin Suga Free no cut
Now come up from promote and tell these hoes what's up
(Suga Free)
Ho must've said Suga Free go wash yo hands I said b***h
I'm Suga Free I wash my hands befo I touch my dick

(Man that b***h is connin you) 
And it she say baby let's go get this paper 
don't playa-hater hater she tryin be all the ho that you can be
Oh no I ain't gone playa hate you 'causez you dressed like you a freak
Goin "Now I lay me down to sleep"
With that pimp stick hangin french-braided right by my feet
Now on a accident pussy sells,

Nigga you lookin foe yo ho main pussy sells
But you gone get plenty mo 'cause pimpin neva fells
Ooohh venom, cross my heart hope to die stick a needle in my eye 
If you didn't have Suga Free you'd have to invent him 
(Got, Someby, Like a Mua f**ka)
(Snoop Dogg)
Me and my niggaz is hard as hell 
Pimp slap a b***h for some clientele

To hit this trick for this lick and go get my mail
If you ever get caught, cracked and thrown in jail
You know a nigga comin throw with that bail
I put you on a track like that for real
And you know and I know that pussy will sell
[Hook (Snoop Dogg)]
Oohh She got the bomb, My b***h got some bomb ass pussy
Oohh She got the bomb, You want the honey nigga I want the money
(Snoop Dogg)
Where ever I go it's all the same
Do the pussy have a name yeah but it might change (da, da)
Dependin on the weather or the mood that that day
If the cat got macked then that fool gone pay
Now lay lay yo head on back
You down with the dogg then work that trap
And don't come back till you get that scratch, and bring it all to me

And b***h think twice befo askin fo deez-nick
And the last time you had some money

b***h that s**t ain't funny (s**t ain't funny)
But a pimp like me got payed (got payed)
And a hoe like you got played (got played)
Now listen to the sound of the bells ring
