(Lil Kim)
*grunting*
huh huh
Catch me in the spot
Lil Cease in the drop
About half an ounce inside the ziploc(uh huh)
Knocking the new one one deuce on the deuce
Me and my old flame and his name is Bruce(yeah)
But....blew my eye when his girl drove by(huh)
Told me bye then he winked his eye(uh oh)
I am too dime for this
To fly to curse(yeah)
Through his jacket out first
Then slammed in reverse
(112)
Oh baby!
You need to know 
Weve been in love
But never no love like this 
I need to know 
Just how you feel 
Let me know if this love is real
Chorus: (2x)
I am tired of waisting time on you 
So tell me what you wanna do 
Is it another man, holding your hand
Why is this a mystery?
Oh baby cant you see
Girl your the only one I'll ever want
The only one I ever need
I think its time 
For us to grow
Weve been friends now for far too long 
The way you kiss
It turns me on 
Let me know if you feel this strong
Chorus 2x
Bridge:
Give me your love
Don't you know that I need your love
I need you in my life
Stay with me 
I'll care for you and me in our lives
(Lil Kim) (grunting in the background)
Just pretend like we friends and do our own thing(c'mon)
With the chinny bang bang
But let the phone ring (I like this)
From the first night I knew you was untrue
Ex-girl came through, she said she missed you
Panties in the bathroom sink, hot pink(hot pink)
What's a girl like me supposed to think?(c'mon)
I'm a bad girl(bad girl)
You shady
I get shady(shady)
Tie up your old lady and jet in the mercedes   floatin
Chorus 4x until fading
