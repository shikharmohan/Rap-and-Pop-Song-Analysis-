Close your eyes
And rest your tired body next to mine
Nobody knows more than you
These hard times that we're living through
But baby, we'll go on and on
Hey, Lord knows we got each other
So kiss me, kiss me hard and long
Hard times, we can get over, yeah
Now the sun, yeah, it must rise
And she coming with a bag of tricks
And treats and dirty lies, nobody smiles, nobody cries
And no one seems to care if they live or die
But baby, we'll go on and on, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord knows
We have got each other, yeah
So come on and kiss me, kiss me hard and long
Ooh, hard times, we can get over
Those ballots and boxes, bullets and guns, yeah
And the outlaw, the outlaw always runs and runs, yeah he does
But baby, just you come, come to me
Come to me, come to me, come to me, baby
When, whenever you need me
So kiss me hard, lay some kisses on me, baby
'Cause I need you and you know that
These hard times, we can get over
