Bucker, I'll beat yo' bad ass
Ain't no other kings in this rap thing they siblings
Nothin' but my children one shot they disappearin'
Ain't no kings in this rap thing they siblings
Nothin' but my children one shot they disappearin'
Bitch niggaz still wanna check my urine
Still can't believe what you see and what you're hearin'
You motherfuckers thought you knew the whole story
Until your mama took a nigga on Maury
Read your test results are you the father?
I looked at his bitch ass told him don't bother
I'm the father of this gangsta shit
Never thought that I have a bunch of bastard kids
Lil' bad ass kids I whoop they ass every night
Send the paramedics bitch and the black and white
I brought you in this world I'll take you out
Do you ugly, so mama can't make you out
You know my style a colt file a report
I'm a dead beat daddy no child support
You get fooled like the last trick get it out your ass bitch
You niggaz know my pyroclastic flow, c'mon
Ain't no other kings in this rap thing they siblings
Nothin' but my children one shot they disappearin'
Ain't no kings in this rap thing they siblings
Nothin' but my children one shot they disappearin'
You want child support
Get it out your ass bitch
You want child support
Get it out your ass bitch
You want child support
Get it out your ass bitch
You want child support
Get it out your ass bitch
Y'all niggaz know y'all bitches know
Where you get it from who's the original
You got your daddy's mouth talk like a criminal
Keep it gangsta son never get pigeon holed
Rap bastards tryin' to make a classic
Keep your dumb ass out of the casket
'Cause intercope'll spend your money they don't give a fuck
About a dead rapper nigga they'll chop it up
Keep it movin' y'all they'll come mop it up
Corrupt L A P D cover up
Everyday nigga we know drama
They ain't lookin' for Osama ask Biggie's mama
Thank God that the gangsta's back
We ain't got to put up with this brainless rap
May your lungs collapse n' MCs are funny
All you can rap about is pussy and money, c'mon
Ain't no other kings in this rap thing they siblings
Nothin' but my children one shot they disappearin'
Ain't no kings in this rap thing they siblings
Nothin' but my children one shot they disappearin'
You want child support
Get it out your ass bitch
You want child support
Get it out your ass bitch
You want child support
Get it out your ass bitch
You want child support
Get it out your ass bitch
All y'all rappers should kiss and make up
Take your bullshit jewelry back to Jacob
Get your mind right nigga and start to wake up
'Cause the whole rap industry needs to shake up
You got million dollar niggaz killin' million dollar niggaz
Bustin' outta Bentleys wearin' chinchillas
There you go again rollin' in your limo
Comin' from the Grammy's shootin' out the window
I know the scripture, but there's something wrong with this picture
What you mad about diamonds all in your mouth
No car, no niggaz house paid off
I never heard of a rapper gettin' laid off
Boy, you a fool or you just act crazy
Or you a grown crack baby born in the 80's
To all you motherfuckers say I went Hollywood
I'm gangsta, I know when I got it good
Ain't no other kings in this rap thing they siblings
Nothin' but my children one shot they disappearin'
Ain't no kings in this rap thing they siblings
Nothin' but my children one shot they disappearin'
You want child support
Get it out your ass bitch
You want child support
Get it out your ass bitch
You want child support
Get it out your ass bitch
You want child support
Get it out your ass bitch
Young rappers lookin' for pocket change
With boo-boo lyrics go get your diaper changed
Young rappers lookin' for pocket change
With boo-boo lyrics go get your diaper changed
Smell like shit
Hey baby change this motherfucker
You smell like shit
