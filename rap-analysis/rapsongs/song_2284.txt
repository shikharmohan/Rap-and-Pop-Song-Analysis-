Can y'all hear that? Yeah
Well, clap ya hands then, come on
Clap ya hands, everybody
Clap ya hands, come on, come on
Put ya hands together and clap 'em
Now can y'all say Eazy?
Come on, say it
Eazy
Everybody come on

Get those hands in the air
Eazy
Come on, come on, say it
Eazy
A little louder come on
Eazy
Come on make some noise
Eazy
Hey yo Ren, let's do this
People from everywhere gather around
Checkin' out the sound that Eazy is throwin' down
With some help from Ren and Dre
Makin' a way with dope styles
Yo Eazy, what ya gotta say?
A miracle of modern creation
Eazy E's on the set hyped up with the bass
And a little bit of what ya love
From a brother who's smooth like a criminal
I mean subliminal otherwise known as a villain
Because I'm ruthless when I spot a sucka, I kill 'em
But most I think know not to deal with me
Yo, it's obvious, tell 'em who you came to see
Eazy
Everybody come on
Eazy
A little louder say it
Eazy
Come on say it, say it, say it
Eazy
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Eazy
Who'd y'all come to see?
Eazy
A little louder come on say it
Eazy
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Eazy
Hey yo yella boy, take me to da bridge
Eazy, hey Eazy
What's up?
Why you wear your pants like that?
I wear my pants like this, fo' easy access baby
Yeah, that's right
Yo homeboy, where we takin' this jam to?
Compton
Where?
Compton
Alright
Now I wanna know who y'all came to see?
Eazy
Everybody in the house
Eazy
Come on say Eazy, come on
Eazy
Say it, say it, say it, say it
Eazy
Come on everybody, come on
Eazy
I can't hear you
Eazy
Everybody come on, say it
Eazy
Who'd y'all come to see?
Eazy
Yo Eazy, kick another verse
Yeah, 'cause this is the way I know you like it
So you won't strike it I took it and I hyped it
And now that it's done, I know ya pleased
At how the E just duz it with ease
Just imagine a crowd screamin', a girl dreamin'
Just to get a picture of me an' my B O Y Z
From the H double O D, N.W.A., down with me
Strong an' I'm ragin' turn the page an'
See I'm not a son of a gun I'm a gauge an'
Nuthin' can avoid this shot 'cause it's hittin'
It's so cool when you touch it, wear a mitten
I'm comin' off raw into ya speaker
Makin' the suckas on the street feel weaker
But most I think know not to deal with me
Yo, it's obvious, tell 'em who you came to see
Eazy
Y'all know what time it is
Eazy
Come on, y'all gotta get mo' hyped up then that
Eazy
Come on say it, say it, say it
Eazy
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Eazy
Get those hands back in the air
Eazy
Come on, come on, come on
Eazy
Who'd y'all come to see?
Eazy
Take me back to the bridge, I like that part
Yo man, you weren't born in no '73
Why you be lyin' bout your age?
Man, why you gotta bring that up?
Yo, get this fool out of here
Yo, Eazy why are you always cursin' on your records?
Man, who are you, Jean Audrey or something
I just do that to get my point across
Now I wanna know who you came to see
Eazy
Everybody come on
Eazy
Hey, y'all this records almost over
Eazy
So that means y'all got to get hyped up
Eazy
Come on, come on, come on
Eazy
I wanna see those hands up in the air
Eazy
Come on say it, say it, say it
Eazy
Who'd y'all come to see?
Eazy
Here's Eazy
Aw, never, I'm just too clever
So, in fact, that no one can sever
A blow from a maniac and yo, I make it clear
So a register is all I hear, money overturned, then I jet
To make another hit, for you to go and get
Record stores sold out because you love it
Another example of how Eazy duz it
Eazy
Who do you all want?
We want Eazy
Eazy
We want Eazy
Who'd y'all come to see?
