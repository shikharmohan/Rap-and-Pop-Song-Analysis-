When you work, sometimes it's wet
And when you sweat you're gonna get wet
You're gonna get wet (OW!)
Work it, oh come on now, work it, ow
Now work, come on work it, ow
(You're gonna get wet)
Work it, once agin come on now, ow
Oh, oh, oh, oh now
[Verse 1]
I was the one to say I'd get the job done, I did it and got with it
I must admit it was well fitted
A piece of the pie would be fly
Instead of a crumb for a bum, uh I gotta get some
But I don't wanna be a second hand, middle man
I wanna take a grand stand and
Makin' the cash flow grow
Pullin' myself outta the dirt
And a job ain't nothin' but work
[Hook 1 with various ad-libs]
WORK!
A job ain't nothin' but work
WORK! WORK!
A job ain't nothin' but work
WORK! WORK!
[Verse 2]
Mo' money, mo' money, mo' money got get me
To get paid in this trade
And I believe that I can acheive
To make ends meet like a hair weave
Survivin' in this economy people in the wold wanna be
Stayin' in the upper class so you're the path
The rich gets the most and the porr gets so little
And only money love can make it in the middle
I can't let life get the best of me
I gotta take, take control of my own destiny
Control what I hold and of course be the boss of myself
No one else will bring my wealth
I gotta hit them streets to make ends meet
So just bust the style of a hustler
Runnin' scam so damn many people will probably get hurt
And a job ain't nothing but work
[Hook 2 with various ad-libs]
Workin' everyday
All the damn week
A job ain't nothin' but work to me
Workin' everyday
On the subway
A job ain't nothin' but work to me
A job ain't nothin' but work
[Verse 3]
No more workin' overtime
You get your's and I'll get mine
I won't stop at any cause
I wont stop till I'm the boss
[Hook 2 with various ad-libs]
[Verse 4]
Straight outta the ghetto
None of the Beverly Hills or Flushing Meadows
I made it this far had to gamble, scramble, ramble
Ain't no shame in my game
And I came through like a double bread
But still there's more here
I'm not the greedy I'm the needy, seekin' that financial status
That where my pockets will be the fattest
I'm not gonna be employed when times are hard
I'm so against workin' I wouldn't even take a blowjob
I'd rather do my own thing
I gotta be the one in charge
To make myself live large
A J-O-B is not for me, I don't want no parts of it
So take this obe and shove it
