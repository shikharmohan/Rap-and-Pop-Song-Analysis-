Wonderin' where you been, baby, baby?
I've been wonderin' where you've been sleepin'
We've been runnin' out of time 'cause you wanna be creepin', pimpin'
I've been sittin' home alone at night, I've been cryin'
We've been runnin' out of time, tired of your lying
Really though how much time you think I got?
The clock is ticking, it's ticking away
You're slippin' away fucking the honeys on the block stop
'Cause if I gotta drop kick a ho, I'll kill her fa'sure
Let's stick around till the murder occurs
How you gonna creep with me and sleep with her?
At the moment of time when I heard the news
My vision must have been blurred
'Cause I ain't think you deserve to lose the nerve for fools
Shit people were saying was absurd to me
But I certainly never thought you would take it to the degree
Of hurtin' me, purposely
We were supposed to be husband and wife
So I dedicated my life to you
Why? So you could keep a chick on the side
'Cause if I sneak a dick on the side you lookin' to die
And booking me a ticket to Chi cause you choose to lie
I need a nigga with an attitude, maturative mind
Give me gratitude when I'm giving him shine
No matter who the bastard was, I was past his love
But he never ran fast enough
I'm a master at the craft 'cause I roll with some master thugs
Laughin' as I pass you up
Should've told me that you wanted to get ass and fuck
I would've set it up so we all had some fun
You assist to get around, I'll be the aid and assist you to get out
Thank them hoes cause you're shit out of luck
And I don't regret what I spit out and bust
I'm sick and tired of you us, I had enough for this sittin' at home
Cryin' 'n' stuff 'n' being alone
Nigga if you want to roam the streets then just let me be
There's a whole gang of niggas that wanna hit my sheets
I've been wonderin' where you've been sleepin'
We've been runnin' out of time 'cause you wanna be creepin', pimpin'
I've been sittin' home alone at night, I've been cryin'
We've been runnin' out of time, tired of your lying
Shit, all I ever did was wait and look out the window
And smoke me some endo
It drove me to drinkin' and getting bent mo'
Gave myself 100% more time to think, was love designed to stink?
Repeatedly you lied to me, told you to confide in me
Ain't nothin' them other hoes could do 'cause I molded you
To fit properly was inside of me
When you're strokin' them, you're thinkin' of riding me
And most of them hopin' to slide with me 'cause I'm a ferocious hoe
When it comes to freaky shit the dopest, you had to blow this
It's all out of proportion and lost your focus
Wasting my time cause I'm just getting older
You're the reason I keep a chip on my shoulder
44 in the holster bulletproof vest under my clothes
I'm supposed to trust you
Every time I leave town I bust you, fuck you, the moanin' and groanin'
Led me to the pillow where you laid your head
Felt like I'd rather be dead instead
Went ahead followed the sound through the hallway
You said you'd always be true
But the neighbors say the bitch was there all day with you
That's why you ain't answered when I was pagin' you
I hit the door, you duck and dove, she tried to find her clothes
Y'all was dodging bullets holes together
You gonna stay with that broke hefer
You know who the So So Defest is
I ain't gotta show a motherfucker breastesses to keep 'em interested in
You better recognize the good investment
From the West Side of Chi nigga
I've been wonderin' where you've been sleepin'
We've been runnin' out of time 'cause you wanna be creepin', pimpin'
I've been sittin' home alone at night, I've been cryin'
We've been runnin' out of time, tired of your lying
I've been wonderin' where you've been sleepin'
We've been runnin' out of time 'cause you wanna be creepin', pimpin'
I've been sittin' home alone at night, I've been cryin'
We've been runnin' out of time, tired of your lying
And I'm running out of breath
