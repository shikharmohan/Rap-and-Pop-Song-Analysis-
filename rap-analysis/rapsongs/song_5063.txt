I just wanted to use computers 
i made it to the finish line first but lose a loser
i wanted to watch so i turned to rocks 
like medusa the block the users
the rock the shootas the shots the helckle of cops
the lugers the glocks the cougers 
should be in my ox making some lock wit my uma
but instead im on the block in this lock wit some cufa's
and im feeling like a doofas i think i understand the meaning of life
and really aint no reason for ice i still want it
still haunted by the demons of christ
but if u give it to me we'll flaunt it
i think niggas is dead broke its funny how
naw it really aint funny sometimes i hate money 
please god take from me
Chorus
And somebody tell me where do i go from now (x4)
All my blessings, i take em as a lesson,
make em into questions and relate em to the present
should i take it as a present? a penalty
but everything is from the man upstairs
cant barely sing cuz the man upstairs 
is bangin on the floor when the music stops will i ever cheer?
will i be seated on the floor 
it really wont matter cat beat me to the score 
i was speaking to these whores
u know i got trouble with women humble beginnings 
mumblin and tremblin now they smugglin and stealing
step ya game up check the dame what?
i nutted on her fangs aint nuthin to hang up
that really happened in fact but i aint manufactur for that
a bumpy ride had to fasten my straps 
i be tryna reach em, other niggas be lyin 
dying to get behind and beat em
i just be tryna teach em
(chorus)
I put it on paper, cuz they'll put u offa paper 
but most of these niggas is paper 
10 1/2 by 8 blue lines 3 holes
hit they ass wit 8's flat lines 3 holes
but they'll gas u up like cold pacer
and leave u in the cold wit a cold without a coat
thats not gangsta them niggas aint ya boys man
then niggas is the poison gotta keep em under the sink
right next to the bleach i say that i'm on top of game
cuz if u under you sink 
i wonder if its just the hunger you think? imagine that till it haunts you
them niggas want you to fall, i fall cuz i want to
yellow leaves and felonies is how i fell on these
god made my head with mind in it 
they made my bread with swine in it
made my bed and now im lyin in it 
i wonder if this is my limit
(Chorus)
