(Yea!)
Yea bitch its me
Weezy F. Baby, your majesty
I'm a heavyweight like a million calories
I'm a star but I dont represent the Dallas team
I Represent New Orleans & its a zoo down there
I'm talkin gorillas, snakes, llions, bears
Im lying here
You think I'm lying? Here (Gun Cocks & Fire)
Take these shots and now you're lying here
Never had fear I'm a muthfuckin Hot Boy
Hit you with the K & make you do the Yung Joc boy
Money bill long, flow strong like Altoids
Keep a lil sugar in the house like Uncle Elroy
Hustle every day day
Payday, checks, I stub em friday, next friday & friday after next!
Juney don't trip I got ya big bro & Mannie on the beat is like money on the flo'!
