Yeah, damn right, nigger
Okay, when girls be out with me
You know how, how long
How long I could go for
I tell 'em like this, nigger
I do it all night, I do it all night
I do it, I do it, do it all night
I make 'em say
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Give, give, give, give me some more)
  (Hey)
Yeah, I do it all night
My whip is all white
And I had a couple drinks
And I got a lil buzz so I'm feelin' alright
But the night's just gettin' started
Haters get disregarded
Roll up them sweets, creep, creep
Let's hit these streets and get retarded
I pop a bunch of bottles
My bitch be poppin' too
Keep talkin' out your face
And she might be poppin' you
She might be pop blockin'
Droppin' down to the floor with it
Meanwhile all my dogs chasin' paper
That's right, we go get it
So get it right
Kill the lights
I'm feelin' like
I might just pop a pill tonight
'Cause the feelin's right
Pass me a Miller Light
Then grab that girl
With the Coke bottle shape, she's my type
I'll take her home
And do the do
I know the Kamasutra
Think what I'll do to you
Stick to you like Superglue
Maybe even like a bubble gum
Don't go to sleep, woman
No matter how many times I come
I do it all night, I do it all night
I do it, I do it, do it all night
I make 'em say
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Give, give, give, give me some more)
(Hey)
I do it all night, I do it all night
I do it, I do it, do it all night
I make 'em say
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Give, give, give, give me some more)
(Hey)
I do it all night
And I ride 'em long pads
Maybe little crib could I'mma ask
Him shortie what that mouth had
Tell me if he's out of sight
Tell me if he's slow and long
Pretty ladies, think above his nose
I said you know you're wrong
But I'm really like show you right
Tell me where you wanna go tonight
Anywhere, anyplace, I can see it in your face
You are the prototype
Took a tellin' I'm so, so high
So, so feelin' like I'm so, so right
Please tell me why the jokes on fire
I can't stop zonin' and I don't know why
Beep Beep, get about my land
Ya'll hoes can't do it like me
If you thinkin' I'm 'bout the game
Take a look at my U-N-I-T
This is why I'm black on deck
But don't get it twisted but strap on deck
The mad on deck, the pack on deck
And there down, they keep a rack on deck
And there's no chairs, there's no we
There's no hoover and there's no me
There's they would them mass MC's
I'm messin' dem caddie and there's on three
No matter what they say, I be gettin' my break
Gettin' my paper, get my cheque
But anybody wanna try to ass up
Then get you some heat
I do it all night, I do it all night
I do it, I do it, do it all night
I make 'em say
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Give, give, give, give me some more)
(Hey)
I do it all night, I do it all night
I do it, I do it, do it all night
I make 'em say
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Give, give, give, give me some more)
(Hey)
How many woman can I
Fill up in my Cadillac?
So how I can't see
Feelin' like I got cataract
Some in the middle
With an ice say I get drunk
And don't know how to act
I don't know how to act
He don't know how to act
And I don't know how to stop
And I don't know how to quit
Blowin' on in the trouble zone
Now we need another field
And I mean up out my man
Now I mean up out my body
So have do this all night
'Cause you're comin' with me, shorty
I do it all night, I do it all night
I do it, I do it, do it all night
I make 'em say
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Give, give, give, give me some more)
(Hey)
I do it all night, I do it all night
I do it, I do it, do it all night
I make 'em say
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Give, give, give, give me some more)
(Hey)
