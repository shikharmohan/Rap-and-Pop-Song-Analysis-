The time has come for bad things to leave
The time has come for right to begin
The time has come for the war of the Gods
It's that time
I'ma take the subtle approach first
'Coz I'm just gettin' started, let's go
Look, I'm the best and there's nothin' that you can do about it
Never needed a publicity stunt, let's tell the truth about it
Even in the core of the streets, you can't sway the youth about it
But keep runnin' yo' mouth and I swear I'ma knock a tooth up out it
I never claimed to be nothin' but who the f*** I am
Never sold cocaine in my life but I'm still the f***** man
Understand nothin' you did makes you better
You claim the streets but the streets respect that chedda
Luda got twice as much yo' life, you can charge it to 'em
I fit four of your houses inside my daughter's room
And still have room for young Karma to play
Givin' back to the children of tomorrow for good Karma today
So you can say whatcha wanna say or you can talk that talk
But real ***** ain't doin' no talkin' 'coz we walk that walk
Album for album, you can see I got a multi-million plan
So call yourself whatever you want 'cept the multi-million man
Lucifer, oh, Lucifer
God of evil, you're the god of hate
Lucifer, oh, Lucifer
The darkness is where you find your light
How many times is you gon' rap about bustin' your gun?
How many times is you gon' trap without bustin' your gun?
Only shots you ever took were subliminal to the general
Disrespectin' those doin' real time with real criminals
And I ain't never did a day in my life
But it should be illegal to walk a day in my life
I paid the price and the cost to be the boss
So you can rest your mouth
I'm universal, Luda never limits himself to the South
I give a damn about ya hootin' and hollerin', it ain't botherin' me
I hear you talkin' but you ain't made it to three
You know where I live but you ain't made it to me
You ain't made, I'm havin' a house party, kid, come get played
You got played, my record label never jerked me
So shoot me, stab me but words'll never hurt me
I feed off your energy, my power's with God
So it's even better if you make ya diss record real hard
Lucifer, oh, Lucifer
God of evil, you're the god of hate
Lucifer, oh, Lucifer
The darkness is where you find your light
See even without the bass and all that treble, I'm as hot as the Devil
But I work for the top floor, homie, get on my level
I'm bein' stripped away of powers 'coz I gave you my blessin'
So it'll take more than majority vote to win this election
Man, mixtapes are not my resume, it's too hot
And I warned them I was comin', I got that number 1 spot
So unless you usin' tampons, quit actin' stuck up
And do like your records say or shut the **** up
Do like your records say or shut the **** up
Do like your records say or shut the **** up
Shut the **** up, shut the **** up
Lucifer, oh, Lucifer
God of evil, you're the god of hate
Lucifer, oh, Lucifer
The darkness is where you find your light
