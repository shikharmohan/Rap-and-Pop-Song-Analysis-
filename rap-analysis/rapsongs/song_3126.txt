We be clubbin'
Hey, hey, hey, hey, look here, look here
First of all, I wanna welcome
All y'all broke ass entreponiggas to the Player's Club
It's packed, niggas don't know how to act
We the macks, V.I.Ps in the back
With a stack of numbers, my niggas like 'em dumber
We oughta get 'em smarter, baby take my order
The only shark that swim in Henn, no water
Got ya daughter doin' shit you don't think she oughta
Gave the order to slaughter any ass like that
You know how the Loni act off the Cognac
Brainiac with maniac, Mack 10
Down ta get this mothafuckin' party crackin'
Nigga, back in so we can smoke a dub
Down ta bump all these bitches at the club, show me love
We be clubbin'
Everybody likes when the girl shakes somethin'
Nigga, don't pull nothin'
We ain't dumpin', we just bumpin' an' bangin'
Like it ain't nothin' wrong, get ya club on
We be clubbin', we be clubbin'
We be clubbin', we be clubbin'
We gettin' in free, so what the fuck now?
Dub S.C.G. just touched down, show a nigga 'round
'Least take a nigga to the sto'
Y'all in fo' the night? Hell, no
Security, bail slow up in the club
Remember when they push an' shove, it's only love
Dubs for everybody waitin' on us
An' fuck everybody hatin' on us
Debatin' on us, but we only visitin'
Ain't tryin' ta fuck with niggas in lizard skins
I see you watchin' me, you should watch her
'Cause if she sick of yo' shit, I'm the doctor, rock her
Show her to the car
An' see how bad she wanna meet these stars
They know who we are, West side
Nigga, meet me by the bar
Shake it off, shake it off, take it off
Break it off, break it off, make it soft
Shake it off, shake it off, take it off
Break it off, break it off, make it soft
Shake it off, shake it off, take it off
Break it off, break it off, make it soft
Shake it off, shake it off, take it off
Break it off, break it off, make it soft
We be clubbin', we be clubbin', we be clubbin'
Baby, beware, Ice Cube is on tilt
Waitress bitchin' off the drinks my nigga spilt
Everybody's sweatin' like it's Armageddon
1999, party over, oops, I'ma still grind
Straight from the West, put away yo' 9
DJ, can ya play my shit one mo' time?
Goddamn, you fine, my nigga speak on it
She got ass for days, put a week on it
Now everybody in the world love to go clubbin'
An' after the club, it's either breakfast or fuckin'
Hope we ain't duckin' from haters in the parkin' lot
Who ain't got nothin', tryin' to prove somethin'
Frontin', we be the niggas who be bluntin'
On our way to the Marriott, keep 'em very hot
West side, hittin' hairy cock
All night long, get ya club on
We be clubbin'
Everybody likes when the girl shakes somethin'
Nigga, don't pull nothin'
We ain't dumpin', we just bumpin' an' bangin'
Like it ain't nothin' wrong, get ya club on
We be clubbin', we be clubbin'
We be clubbin', we be clubbin'
Shake it off, shake it off, take it off
Break it off, break it off, make it soft
Shake it off, shake it off, take it off
Break it off, break it off, make it soft
Shake it off, shake it off, take it off
Break it off, break it off, make it soft
Shake it off, shake it off, take it off
Break it off, break it off, make it soft
We be clubbin'
Everybody likes when the girl shakes somethin'
Nigga, don't pull nothin'
We ain't dumpin', we just bumpin' an' bangin'
Like it ain't nothin' wrong, get ya club on
