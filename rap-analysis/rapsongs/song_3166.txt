Hell yeah uhh
Ta dow uhh
Ta dow uhh
Ta dow uhh
Tadow, how ya like me now I'm in the mix
It's 1986 and I got the fix
With the chicken and a quota, got the bakin' soda
Let the water boil you, workers all loyal
Dropped out the 12th 'cause my wealth is shorter
Than a midget on his knees, now I slang ki's
Infest my hood with crack, I'm the mack
It take a nation of millions to hold me back
Too big for my britches, and I got bitches
Now I'm hittin' switches, niggaz want my riches
Used to get 18, when my G was alive
Now a ki' is 13 5 89's the number, another summer
Get down police ain't gettin' no dumber
Streets dried up, used to think it would last
But being a kingpin is a thing of the past
They tried to blast me for slangin' a boulder
Now I got my ass in Minnesota
Got my own crew, it's on brand new
Damn, what can I do? ooh
Ta dow, what can I do?
Ta dow, what can I do?
Ta dow, how ya like me now?
Ta dow, what can I do?
Ta dow, what can I do?
Ta dow, how ya like me now? fool
Already done stacked me half a meal ticket
Bought a house next to prince, now I can kick it
Now I got ends, wavin' to my friends
Rollin in a Benz, goin' to see the twins
Play at the 'dome, police are tappin' my mobile phone
I'm almost home, gettin' excited, indicted
Spent a grip and a year tryin' to fight it
Lawyer got paid plea, no contest
'Cause everything I own, got repossessed
Now take a look at the dust
And I'm happy 'cause I only got 36 months
I never picked up a book
'Cause my arms are 16 inches, nigga look
Can't wait for 92 so I can get with my crew
And see, what can I do
Ta dow, what can I do?
Ta dow, what can I do?
Ta dow, how ya like me now?
Ta dow, what can I do?
Ta dow, what can I do?
Ta dow, how ya like me now?
Fucked up in the pen, now it's 94
Back in L.A., and I'm bailin' through the do'
Everybody, know I gotta start from scratch
So where the work at, and niggaz smirk at
Me sayin' ain't nuttin', poppin' from here to the L.B, what you tell me?
No it ain't crackin', everybody's jackin' for a Coupe
Since, they sent in the troops
Even though I got muscle, that ain't my hustle
Takin' nigga's shit in a tussle
No skills to pay the bills
Talkin' about education to battle inflation
No college degree, just a dumb ass G
Yeah you fool, who me?
I got a baby on the way, damn it's a mess
Have you ever been convicted of a felony? Yes
Took some advice from my Uncle Fester
All dressed up in polyester
Welcome to McDonalds, may I please help you?
Yeah you can help me punk
Give me all of the money or I'm dumpin'
That's on my momma
Ay homeboy, while you at it
Gimme large fries, a strawberry shake
A Big Mac, 'cause this Mack 10 fo' life
Can I roll wit you? what can I do?
Now I'm on the run, with a gun
And this fool I don't know, pedal to the flo'
Swervin', servin' all of the pigs
Just because they tryin' to split my wig
I'm in custody, L.A.P.D
One more felony, strike number 3
25 to life in cell block two
It's true, that's what I gotta do, ooh
Ta dow, what can I do?
Ta dow, what can I do?
Ta dow, how ya like me now?
Ta dow, what can I do?
Ta dow, what can I do?
Ta dow, how ya like me now?
Wesyde
  (What can I do, what can I do?)
Ice cube
  (What can I do, what can I do?)
What can I do, ooh
