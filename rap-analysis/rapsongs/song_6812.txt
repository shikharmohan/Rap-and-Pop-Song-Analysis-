I party like a rockstar
I look like a movie star
I play like an all star
I fuck like a pornstar
Baby I'm a superstar
Always posted at the bar
Always wit' a couple broads
Maybe I'm just dat dat raw
Dawg check da resume
I hit somethin' everyday
Ask about me n' dey'll say
That chicko run MIA
Pitbull, young boss
That's fire, go girl wear it out
'Til you're tired
Just tryin' to pay tuition, liar
My corner is like HBO's wire
So please don't play no games
And baby don't say no names
And we can do this one more again
Next time you can bring your friends
So go get your friends
And I get my friends
And we can be friends
Do dis every weekend
We can hit your place
We can hit my place
She's on my top 8
I bagged her off of Myspace
Go girl, go girl
Go girl, go girl
Go girl, go girl
Go girl, go girl
Shake dem dice and roll em'
Shake dem dice and roll em'
When dey ask you what's dat dance
You say dat's the hustle man
Girl I wanna know your name
Girl who you be?
Don't care wif' who you came
As long as you leave wit' me
What chu sippin' on?
I'll buy you a drink
Get you in them shiny things
Yer grill be pink
I see those Jimmy Choos
Those Vera Wangs
I love the way you work
Girl do your thing
You see my stunna shades
I'm like a star
My click is full of ballas
We at the bar
So go get your friends
And I get my friends
And we can be friends
Do dis every weekend
We can hit your place
We can hit my place
She's on my top 8
I bagged her off of Myspace
Go girl, go girl
Go girl, go girl
Go girl, go girl
Go girl, go girl
Shake dem dice and roll em'
Shake dem dice and roll em'
When dey ask you what's dat dance
You say dat's the hustle man
Diamond princess
I make em' bust quick
Man I back it up
Like a Mack Truck
Don't talk about it, boy
Be about it, boy
I got them girls, boy
Turn out your girls, boy
Just talking freak nig
I'm talking freaky shit
'Cause I'm a freaky bitch
So go get your friends
And I get my friends
And we can be friends
Do this every weekend
We can hit your place
We can hit my place
She's on my top 8
I bagged her off of Myspace
Go girl, go girl
Go girl, go girl
Go girl, go girl
Go girl, go girl
Shake dem dice and roll em'
Shake dem dice and roll em'
When dey ask you what's dat dance
You say dat's the hustle man
