[Eazy E]
1 2 3 and to the 4
Eazy mutherfuckin E with the crome to ya dome
Cruising in my 64 ragtop

Now when i hit that switch im bouncin
More bounce to the ounce and im clownin
Keep the gat in my lap
'cause im fully strapped
For the carjackas ,but no haps 'cause i pack the tech 9'
1 2 3 and to the 4
Eazy mutherfuckin E with the crome to ya dome
Cruisin in my 64 ragtop
I got alotta juice alotta fuckin block
Now when i hit that switch im bouncin
More bounce to the ounce and im clownin
Keep the gat in my lap
'cause im fully strapped
For the carjackas ,but no haps
'cause i pack the tech 9' plus an ak47
Send a one way ticket to my hell or maybe heaven
Peep nigga i dont sleep
Bury mutherfuckers in the concrete
You try to creep kinda slow in the astro
But i peep you niggaz out in my left window
So i blast and i blast 'til i blast no more
Yo they call a mutherfucker john doe
[chorus 3x]
Old nigga E still cruisin
Cruisin down the street in my 64
[Game]
1, 2, 3 and to the 4
Pumps in the trunk of that cherry red '64
Im riding with the ghost of Eazy hoppin the leany
He watching for demons
Nigga if you try me then im cocking the nina
Begging lucifer to gimmie a reason
To have a hundred thou. cash brought down to the precinct
Ima make bail money, this rap shit is a monopoly
And i got property, thats get out of jail money
Nigga i came from poverty
Shoot-outs, gang-banging, and robberies
Car-jacking, snatching Mata's impalas
Do that with or without the ... going inside of me
Hop out the ride and empty the 45 into his body
Im not to be fucked with
Whether im straight out of Compton
Or straight out of Cashville on that Young Buck shit
Terrorizing Whoo Kid 24/7
'til 1 of you niggas put me with Eazy in heaven.
[chorus 3x]
Old nigga E still cruisin
Cruisin down the street in my 64
