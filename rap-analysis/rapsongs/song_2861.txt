Take me across her lap
She used to whip me with a strap
When I was bad, bad
Take me across her lap
She used to whip me with a strap
When I was bad, bad
Picture me snotty nose sittin'' on my aunt's lap
The kid like five or six, shit, I will curse back
I got it from the older folks sittin' in the living room
Everybody had cups stylistic song boom
But then came Darryl Mack, lightin' all the reefer up
Baby, caught a contact I'm trying to tie my sneaker up
I'm missing all the loops strings going in the wrong holes
It feels like I'm wobbling, look at all these Afros
Soon as I thought I was good the joke's on me
I heard a voice "get in the room, I get angry
Sting my feet catch a tantrum, spit, scream, fuck that
Momma shake me real hard, then get the big gat
That's called the belt help me as I yelled
I'm in the room like, with mad welps
Ragged out, bad belt yes her presence was felt
Then get my black ass in the bed it's time crash out
Take me across her lap
She used to whip me with a strap
When I was bad, bad
Take me across her lap
She used to whip me with a strap
When I was bad, bad
Despite the alcohol, I had a great old mama
She famous for her slaps and to this day she's honored
But when I was a lil' dude her son was a lil' rude
I picked the peas off my plate and pour juice in her nigga food
Get beat, then I'd run and tell grandma, "Mama hit me for no reason"
She whipped me hard when I finished eatin'
And felt that belt stingin' after I wet that bed
Hid my drawers and start cryin', when she felt that bed
Caught another when I told her those, the fake pro-keds
In the corner weavin' and screamin' trying to block my head
Nowadays, kids don't get beat, they get big treats, fresh pair of sneaks
Punishments like have a ceas, back then when friends
And neighbors would bust that ass and bring you back to your momma
She got the switch in the stash that's back to back beatings
Only went outside for free lunch with welts on my legs still leakin', yo
Take me across her lap
She used to whip me with a strap
When I was bad, bad
Take me across her lap
She used to whip me with a strap
When I was bad, bad
