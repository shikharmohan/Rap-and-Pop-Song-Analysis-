As I was way in the back I noticed that
Salt was rockin' the hell out of some of you cats
Then I decided to slow down the tempo
To let you catch your breath so
Just wait for the drumroll then you can feel the flow of
Syncopated soul power
Got to have syncopated soul power
All you need is syncopated soul power
Yeah, gimme some soul power
Everybody needs soul power
I'm the Pepa, much deffer
Half-stepper No, I'm never
World renowned as a vocalist
When Salt is not around I'm a soloist
Puttin' pep in your step seriously
Conquest is the best lyrically
The mic is a component I use on my opponents
Only to flaunt it, it just sound good, don't it
Rhyme power, organic as a sunflower
And full of soul power
All I got is sycopated soul power
All you need is sycopated soul power
Cold kickin' soul power
Steady kickin' soul power
Now raise your hands and keep 'em there for a minute
I'm gonna tell you what to do with it
Wave it like a flag, dirty rag
Keep 'em there till they get jet lag
Pepa's on the mic, and the mic is on
If Salt's at my side, nothing can go wrong
Meet the mix empress, Spinderella, head on
And that, my friend, is the meaning of a rap song
Keep your shirt on, don't lose the buddies
If I ain't done rappin' yo, Spin, keep cuttin'
Ain't nothin' gonna stop us now
We on a roll with syncopated soul power
Got to have syncopated soul power
All you need is syncopated soul power
Soul power, soul power
Soul power, soul power...
