Let me tell you about the Proto Culture
If you don't know the culture here's the whole structure
We've had enough of the lackluster, trust us
We get the kind of games you can't rent at Blockbuster
Game related, raise it bit by bit
Yo D, link up the cable we'll go hit for hit
Phantasma plasma particle beam means I have you
On the run, the rendered effects hot like magnas
I play games by Capcom with a power glove strapped on
On any platform, I don't spend my dough on Phat Farm
Video games, I got many to play
Before my life expires to fill my desires
Mastering your hardest boss, shattering all stars across
Ain't hard to cross the finish line, floatin' on Daytona
Wex, Gex or Kloana, I get 'em all at cost
RPG, Platform we transform like Macross
Rival schools, Batsu purchase you ought to
It came with one free CD, it's like I bought two
I hope they make part II for Dreamcast
'Cause games I've seen in mags, you won't believe they have
Getting callouses turning over asteroids, graviton bombs destroyed
Getting moms annoyed, now I'm hacking Nightmare Creatures
Their features splattered across the screen
It gets more clean each year
I remember, my homie Ed Coats had the most
A Colecovision, every week I'd visit
Playing Donkey Kong Jr., Venture, Rock and Rope
Games I thought was dope while my mom's was watching soaps
I'm on the next level
I got a double barrel shotgun in the Doomworld
Waiting on the next devil, armor's low, check the arsenal
Rupture the main conductor playin' Disruptor
I remember Ninja Gaiden finished it finally
With Ramone wouldn't answer the phone
This was before getting blown, I own the first Nintendo Power
With the maps of Zelda help me conquer in an hour

Hey KU, you know my SEGA collection is massive
Got all the past hits and classics
Herzog Zwei now Panzer Zwei
Originality that made me a fan today
It's Pandemonium, it's like Toys R Us
Flippin' the next Saturn game brings out the boys in us
It's poisonous taking out the boys in blue
In Grand Theft Auto, snatch a Rolls Royce to use
Yeah, I'll admit PlayStation improved
Come visit Feudal Japan with me and Tenchu
Bushido Blade 2 with sword play so accurate
Mega Man Legends but I had to buy a map for it
I fence Hyo to get a Neo-Geo
For Samurai 64 in full rendered splendor
Rival counter and enter, my sword in his innards
My joint was being Leonardo wuppin' on Splinter
I gotta get Xenogears, that's the type of game that relieves my fears
Get it from overseas to here
I gotta get Psychic Force, authentic arcade that I can endorse
They got me liking imports
I'll need to be at the next E3
What's the next CD? I need to see, me and D signing checks
Let's float overseas, mingle with game companies
Giving tips to Capcom and SEGA, you can't front on these
To anyone who knew me better
Know I chose Saturn first 'cause it's 2-D heaven
Bernie Stolar dropped the ball with the RAM cartridge
X-men Vs. Street fighter could've expanded the market
Marvel Vs. Capcom beyond fathom
Tell the truth, PlayStation ain't ready to have 'em
Come on I'll bring the onslaught, Alpha and Omega
Khaos Unique brought to you by SEGA
