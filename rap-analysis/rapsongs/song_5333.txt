We've been through things
Feels like we've been to hell and back
And the ones you've lost
I'd give my life if I could bring them back
And your self esteem
Might be low from what people say
Hold your head up high
Promise its gonna be OK
I'm not perfect just like you
So come on let me give you a hug
I got problems just like you
So don't nobody sit here and judge
I'm not perfect just like you
So come on let me give you a hug
I got problems just like you
And everybody needs some love
When your feeling bad
Some friends they can't be found
'Cause some people love it
Just to see you when your down
But its OK pick yourself up
Start over again
If you try you will
You will succeed in the end
I'm not perfect just like you
So come on let me give you a hug
I got problems just like you
So don't nobody sit here and judge
I'm not perfect just like you
So come on let me give you a hug
I got problems just like you
So don't nobody sit here and judge
Shake a hand, shake a hand y'all
To every woman every man y'all
Tell a friend, tell a friend y'all
'Cause united we stand y'all
I'm not perfect just like you
I'm not perfect just like you
I'm not perfect just like you
I'm not perfect just like you
