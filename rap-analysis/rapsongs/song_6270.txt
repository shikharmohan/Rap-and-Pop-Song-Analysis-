W K Y A Gilla house radio
Yeah n***, I'm back
And the weather outside is hot than a m***
But we cold chillin' in the Brick City
So kick back, light some b***
Put your hands on a big fat greasy a***
And turn the music up
As we take yo' a*** on a ride as Redman goes wild on W K Y A
Gilla house, yo, yo
Come see the sideshow, n*** how it go?
With my eyes closed I can hit nine folks
You want the beef n***? Hit the prime roast
My mic's the gun, the bullet's the 9 volt
F*** the convo, here go the pyro
G.I. Joe mixed with Desperado
I ride low with a bomb in the armrest
Prepare to snipe a f*** like John F.
Connect ya like Nynex, n*** holla
I'm on the corner like Hollywood with a Starbuck
Bring it to ya like the Japs in Pearl Harbor
Red is to blunt like redneck is to Marlboro
This is our world, join the effect
Clean your ears for Doc Donald Goines with a pen
What more can I say, Doc billin'
Gilla general, Def Squad lieutenant
Ill at will, thought you knew
I'm in the hood, you most wanted up in Malibu
I don't co-sign s*** that ain't hundred percent
Tryna blow money wise like Bubba Gump Shrimp, gilla
I feel I'm young
Out for the crumbs
Shotgun warrior with a Wu-Tang tongue, gilla
How ya like that, tell me how ya like that?
How ya like that, tell me how ya like that?
Don't f*** around or walk around with an icepack
I test your gangsta, didn't wanna fight back
This for n***, Jews and white trash
I deliver them punch lines with a nice jab
Smokin' weed on a Go-Cart at Bo Craft
BC-4, straight out of low cash
Low cash, low cash, W K Y A, Low cash, yeah
The new Brick City, low down, gritty
Fo' pound semi, minds I leave 'em empty
Keep the fo' pound round the 9 milli with me
So when the Feds run up, they likely not to hit me
Like J-Kwon everybody, in the club tipsy
You be on the mixtapes soundin' like 50
But this is Brick City, gilla house we comin' through
Smokin' blunts, sippin' Henny too
Girls is bouncin' n*** bouncin' too
On the blocks, new whips we drivin' through
We getting money, CD's is pay per view
At the go, go girls come up into, so listen up as we tell y'all what to do
Come holla at my m*** crew, yeah
