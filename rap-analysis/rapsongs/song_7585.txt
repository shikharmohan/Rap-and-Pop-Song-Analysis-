Let's get it
These haters just hating they ain't talking 'bout s***
I'm a grown a** man I flip my own ***
I don't need yo, help I can own my own ***
Ain't no mother*** help me write my rhymes
Ain't no nobody pay for my studio time
See me at the top and want to claim my fame
Hunting took my chain yeah, mother*** right
You better off saying a *** took my life
Want to assassinate my character but I ain't acting
It ain't adding up so you can't subtracting
B.I.G. said it first more money more problems
The why I see it more problems more money, what's up
I got the streets on lock, Atlanta on my back

Eyes wide shut I don't see these haters
'Cause deep in your heart you want to be me player
Want to stand in my shoes, want to hit my ***
Want to live my life, want to rock my shows, no
Ya young punks with ya loose a** lips
I keep a AR with them loose a** clips
What type of real G name himself after a bag
Homie you's a hoe, a Loui Vuitton fag

Twenty-two's on the 2-door it sits so right
Ice tray on my wrist yeah, it shines so bright
Make moves in the day and I ball by night

Had them on the triple stack, hit 'em both in the shower
Pedal to the medal 'bout a buck 85
