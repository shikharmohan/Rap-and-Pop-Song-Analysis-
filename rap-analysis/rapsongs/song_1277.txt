Once again the powers of the herb open up the mind
Seek deep inside, tell me what you find, come on
Who be the ones steppin' in the room
Everybody welcome to the temple of boom
Back, let me see ya fat indo sack
And get weeded, somebody, everybody need it
Mari-juana, mari-juana, don't ya wanna
Give me love when I put the flame on ya
Homie I'm the one with the shotgun in the closet
Next to the fat bags full of chronic
Puto, don't ya be steppin', with ya hands open
Askin' me "Can I get a hit of what t'cha smokein"
I ain't got no kind of love for a brother
Who comes to the party, with no Bud
I be smokein' this, indo-blazin', funk Buddah
Everybody, wanted it, now they talk about the hooter
Up until the summer of '91
Wasn't no muthafuckas talkin' 'bout smokein' blunts
From the west coast to the east coast
Everybody be braggin'
But , I'm the one who be puffin' most
First it started with the nickel, then the dime
Then the twenty, spendin' up all my money
Now, I roll with the nelco
With the pound in the pad smokein' up the indo
Just take a deep breath, hit it then pass it to the left
Keep the mutha fuckin' stress
Smoke it up, just puff it up, oh, yeah
Light it up, then put your spliff up in the air
Do you wanna spark another owl?
Do you wanna spark another owl?
Everybody spark another owl
Everybody spark another owl
I wanna spark another owl
I wanna spark another owl
Do you wanna spark another owl?
Do you wanna spark another owl?
Yea, stroll the ways of the Buddah mastas
Brings me to the temple of boom
I see people everywhere startin' to understand the point
When I'm talkin' about the joint
Talkin' 'bout that marijuana, talkin' 'bout the sense
Talkin' 'bout the kind mota boca loa-loa
Maui, lugers of work-ready
The Mexican greenba, cheeba, cheeba y'all
Yeska, humble pound weed, the crypt
The chocolate tide, the Afgani
The Meefrakan, the indo
The skonka, the bad breath sense
