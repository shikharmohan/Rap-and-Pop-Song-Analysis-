If it's not De La Slow, then it's not WRMS
Where Cat's in control, twisting and tuning
Until you're perfectly content
Special cat call goes out to the suckers at the donut shop
Thanks for serving it to me dark, hot, and no caffeine
Snuggle tight and hang loose boys
It's time to groove to a De La Slow move on WRMS
