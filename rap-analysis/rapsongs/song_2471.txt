Peace to Chuck, Chuck D, yeah
You're not tellin' 'em huh? Yeah
They go ooh and ahh when I jump in my car
People treat me like Kareem Abdul Jabbar
When I'm supreme rap star, they all know me E.D
When I flash the greens on TV
MC's be robbin' me, of my technique
The way I speak, the way I get down, the way I sound
And if you ask me, they must be on the jock
Of the innovator, rock roll bounce to skater
Ok fuck it, enough with the tight shit, grab the mic quick
Hollywood niggaz, put it down spit some hype shit
EPMD Erick and Parrish, makin' dollars
The rap scholars keep the show packed like funeral parlors
Deadly, murderous I know you heard of us
Holdin' shit down on the block, nobody servin' us
The E Double and Mic Doc, Boondox
Def Jam's off the meter yo, this shit is hot
Never seen before, or heard before, the uncut raw
I'm Erick Sermon and I'm Parrish Smith
Never seen before, or heard before, the uncut raw
I'm Erick Sermon and I'm Parrish Smith
Check it, now I'm back with the flyest material
Mic Doc and E Dub the Grand Imperial
My mic's deadly, so I scratched off the serial
And stashed it, until I have to kill at will
Keep it movin', yes it's me in the flesh
It's no illusion, fuck around and catch minor contusions
Whatever, I'm Smokin' Joe when it comes to rap
I'm a pro-fessional, Tiger Woods I'm good
Time to black out, no doubt, people wanna know about
The inside scoop with the group, and are they comin' out
Damn skippy I'm tipsy, high like a hippie
Don't take drinks from strangers 'cause niggaz slip mickies
That's why I stay on cue, like Omar Epps in J-U
I-C-E so chill and bust the debut
In rare form the false alarm's the Mic Don's
Back in effect, snap that neck, the P's gone
Never seen before, or heard before, the uncut raw
I'm Erick Sermon and I'm Parrish Smith
Never seen before, or heard before, the uncut raw
I'm Erick Sermon and I'm Parrish Smith
Never say never, what? EPMD's back together
And if it gets warm take off the hot sweater
Fill up the ill slick flow, flow watch us throw, throw
Down with the other brothers toe to toe
And if ya slow ya blow, that's why we comin' with the ammo
Yo ten year veterans, a thousand rap sessions
Yeah, the hard rockers, the crowd shockers
The head knockers, yeah EPMD's off the rockers
Never seen before, or heard before, the uncut raw
I'm Erick Sermon and I'm Parrish Smith
Never seen before, or heard before, the uncut raw
I'm Erick Sermon and I'm Parrish Smith
Never seen before, or heard before, the uncut raw
I'm Erick Sermon and I'm Parrish Smith
Never seen before, or heard before, the uncut raw
I'm Erick Sermon and I'm Parrish Smith
Yeah, yeah yeah, dude whassup
That was dope, word up
EPMD for Nine-What, whatever, yeah
Sample this shit, word up!
