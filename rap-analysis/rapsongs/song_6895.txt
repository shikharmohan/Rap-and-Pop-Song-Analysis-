This the one... this one here... right here
{Chorus - Do you want it? repeated}
[Tajai]
Ah yeah, my peoples if you want me, cool
Everybody know the T is the joint be comin through
with the Massey like Napolean Bonaparte(sp?) I'm swoll
yall niggas that be flowin, it's all heart no soul
you lack the balance see, couldn't rip it in virtual reality
I got a style that's dehumanizing
Keepin' eyes on swell
the demise of your personel
that's not surprising
Yo I got live and then my verse impailed your best man
show me that as I get in it
Sorry, no gimmicks
cause with me the possibilities is limitless
I'm too inventive wit' this English shit
and if ya didn't list this as your favorite
you simply didn't listen...closely
to the rhymes I kick to my sisters and my brethoren (sp?)
never try to front like I'm a veteran
but give respect and receive I leave
but you feel the presence
cause the bass drum got resonance
[Opio]
Check it out cause you all know me
Opio Lindsay...champion MC
internationally...niggas be challenging thee
Heiroglyphics imperium steering 'em heat
get get up out ya seat
nigga ya weak
I'd rather spit at a freak
and get up under the sheets
instead of... configuring speech
for niggas to leech on
my crew touch the mic
Souls of Mischief we be on...point
sure as Casual hit the joint
making muthafuckas scream and shout
ya know we turn it out
so baby girl with the light brown eyes
let me speak to you a minute and examine them thighs
and get wise to the fact
that I'm hip to that act
don't try to play that role
let's get real and hit the sack
it ain't all like that
you know...we keep in contact
let me take control... just relax
{Chorus}
[A-Plus]
I demonstrate the skills that niggas need to flow
they need to heed a bro
but even so I still leave you though
you know I never understood about wack
ain't nuthin' good about wack
it's all shit, that's what my niggas call it
that's all I know 'n' fuck the rest raps
'll buck ya chest perhaps
ya luck is less, black
you flunked the test, yes
and you will never pass
I got them hoes sayin' A-plus
you so fresh with ya clever ass
Now y'all MC's'll get ransacked
see I'm the man, black
stand back
this is what ya plan lack
the proper use of flows
___________ my ________
you hoes that don't do ya own rhymes
got to chew the pros
the buddha flows with a sack on the floor
from '93 til we chill now we back in the door
but now, it's gruesome when them crew's dump.
so I gotta bruise 'em
Heiroglyphics we aint never losin!
[Phesto]
Here goes Phes-rock
makin' ladies just drop
out of conrol from the soul
making money don't stop
to the fellas never jealous
celebrate the fact
Souls of Mischief comin' way too phat
to sit back and ________ maybe
you be excilerating and exhault
as I expand my palm and baby in the _______
not at all was I shocked she wasn't ________
at my performance
I leave 'em in aw without warning
so try to ascertain your ass a brain cause I reign
breakin backs and necks over tracks for checks
leavin' niggas heartless, discarded
by the genuine artist strechin' to the farthest
reachin' your imagination, niggas catchin' a blur
I'm like the ________,
my rhymes come together like clockwork
perfect is the only way to word it
energy excerted
it's Souls of Mischief on your circuit
check it out...
(Chorus)
