Yeah, big Snoop Dogg, LiLana, my nephew BigSha
(Chorus)
Dime piece, locking to your fantasy
(don't be your fantasy)
So don't blink
(don't blink, blink)
You can miss your loud the streets
(relax the streets)
LiLana:
Relax, recline
It's pleasure with the time
Vacations and diamonds and messy soda time
I don't get it -
More than bumping crime.
Don't blink your eyes
and listen all the good time.
Chorus:
Dime piece, locking to your fantasy
(don't be your fantasy)
So don't blink
(don't blink, blink)
You can miss your loud the streets
(relax the streets)
(Snoop Dogg)
I step off the plane, spit my game
so sweet and sticky like candy cane.
One night with the boss
What it costs, I'ma show you how we do in the land of 
the loss.
It's doggy d-o, like me-o
So sick of L-O-B-E S-O-E-G
Roll mall diesel, move through Europe like a peasoul 
With my fizzle.
You know I always take care of you,
last thing in Bulgaria
All up in the club with LiLana.
Trying to start the party,
BigSha get them giros at more zeroes
Big snoop Dogg get your heat roll.
It's plain to see, that the thing to be is your 
fantasy.
So don't blink.
(Lilana) Heeeyy
(Chorus)
Dime piece, locking to your fantasy
(don't be your fantasy)
So don't blink
(don't blink, blink)
You can miss your loud the streets
(relax the streets)
Imagine how out I can make you down,
make you down down down
Do it to you now
I can be all your wildest dreams,
say "become here now"
I'm bout to break it down
(BigSha)
It's your ball will becoming the fleet
Do the King Kong bounce with the ass, while I'm 
stopping the beat.
In the Lambo blow even coming the G,
the best boy from bulgarian chief
(I'm in the streets)
All dimes are women in peace
My money deep I'm flowing
Respect the Bee Gees most wanted
I drive the roof, BigSha got the jews
A bulgarian chapter school.
My cell I had tapped gonna stop the move
I can slide up, stop and *puff*
Shot the goose, get a fly girl not the bus
So on my mind I talk to Snoop
(Talk to Snoop?)
If you wanna do the pin number
pif (!?) in a la-la-life with LiLana
And those bubbles showing up muscles,
the captain on the front line hustle.
(Chorus)
Dime piece, locking to your fantasy
(don't be your fantasy)
So don't blink
(don't blink, blink)
You can miss your loud the streets
(relax the streets)
