Fresh checkerboard Vans and a t-shirt
And its goin down but she first
My flow sweet make my teeth hurt
I spit icecream bars thats dessert
To me theres no such thing as a G-1st
Yeah my feature price high like a mink purse
I smoke a whole reef of that reefer
Drugs are bad but i beg to differ, sir
I just take a look at her face
So she can see that my shades are Versace, and she purr
Cuz i'm a cool cat per say
So i give her my life and now i got 8, woah word
She ask me to come over her place, i said sure
She said she been horny all day, i got the cure
I'm on her like turf
Now bring that ass, bring that ass, bring that ass hurrr (here), ya dig?!
I dont know what you've been told
But i can tell u something bout me
I smoke weed
I drink and i roll
Now is you fuckin with me?
Now i cant tell u shit bout the next man but he aint got nothin on me
Cuz after a pill and a half and a shot of patrone
I'm a pussy MVP, yeah
