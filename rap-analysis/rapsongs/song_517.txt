[WISH BONE]
Some niggas be passin' that weed on
To them thugsta niggas from Cleve-lawn
Gotta smoke 'til it's all gone
Now what a BONE 'cause a nigga be creep on
Call all my thugstas, all them niggas drink
Call all my thugstas, all them niggas smoke weed
[KRAYZIE BONE]
Gotta get some hydro
Gotta toke like a loc with a little bit of smoke in my throat
Can't let a me high go
I'ma broke Mo Thug got the bud and it get up up on me...inhale
Just split up a blunt and me roll up a fat one, make it POD'ed
They lable me killa, drug dealer and burn up nigga crazy weed and...
[LAYZIE BONE]
Blaze up a blunt, gotta have that hydro
Need me a hit of the tweed, make me drop to my knees
And I gotta give love to the green leaves
Steadily spendin' that cheese, feelin' at ease
Thuggin' on off in the cut now, when I'm checkin' on how this shit sound
In the Range smoked out with my nigga Tay
Smokin' that tweed 'til we fall in the grave
[BIZZY BONE]
Make up the dummy to make up me money, weed run me
And headed for broke, smokin' the bong
Hit that bong wrong, make a me cough and choke
To the real OT's loc strong BONE
I gotta C note to toke on, so choke on
And holdin' the smoke 'til it's gone, real long and stay blown
[KRAYZIE] (overlapping)

Wanna get you fucked up, wanna get you fucked up

Wanna get you fucked up, wanna get you fucked up
(Pass me some reefer)
[WISH BONE]

Doctor told me better stop but man fuck that bitch

Smokin' 'til a me die, nigga gotta get high if he wanna come ride
Come with me smoke on a blunt and get nice

[LAYZIE BONE]
Feelin' on tilt man, quarter o to the brain
Smokin' like blunt after blunt my niggas insane
Other niggas can't hang, it's a BONE thing

Nigga got his weed to the curb, split up and serve
But fuck it gotta have them green herbs
[BIZZY BONE]
