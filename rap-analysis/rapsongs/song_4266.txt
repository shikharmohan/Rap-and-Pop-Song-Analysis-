Live from the five hundred and four
it's Mr. crazy flow jumpin like a bungee no rope
even in a dungeon i glow
even if it aint sunny i glow
if aint bout money i go
nowhere im nailed to the floor
money controls where i go
it is the sail to my boat
and it's goin down, it's goin down like theres a whale in the boat
see you can smell that i smoke
and yep i sip that lean you hit me wit that combination it make my eyes bleed
im shark in the water yep i swim with the big
so i dont have time to deal with willie the squid
L' L' lillie pad nigga L'look at the monster

and all you new rappers ya just new lunch
Flow sick so sick need a Doc yes
A creature monster like the loch ness
I gets hotter by the tock, before i sizzle to death
I just tell the clock give me sec
In the middle with the war, where ma enemy at?
Im runnin this bitch like Eric B enemy back
cuz everytime I hit a track I'm like a energy pack, 
the instruments are cryin out where the sympathy at?
Yeah If you bettin money baby him will be back
Whatever legends look like, bitch im fin to be that
I walked right in hip hop, like where ma dinner be at?

I hate that women lie so I lie to them back
Got two bitches in my pants quiet neither them that
Alot of bitches want dick I give alot of them that
Lets do a pill I could fuck you for a hour with that
and to the kids drugs kill im acknowledging that
but when I'm on the drugs I dont have a problem with that.
And ma niggas got guns the size of toddlers biatch
and we aiming right at your fuckin collar biatch!
