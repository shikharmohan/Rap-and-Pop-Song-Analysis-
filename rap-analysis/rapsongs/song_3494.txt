What in the fuck was that Kanye?
I thought I told you to do some shit for the kids
You give me these motherfucking graduation tickets right now
You can give me this motherfucking robe
You Kansas City idol
You will not walk across that stage
You won't slide across that stage
Motherfucker can't pull you across the stage Kanye
Who told you, I told you to do something uplifting
I am trying to get you out here with these white people and
This is how you gone do me, you know, you's a nigga
And I don't mean that in no nice way
Got the lil' kids singing about the shit now the jokes on you
You throw your motherfucking hands in the air
And wave your body, body, you can get the fuck off this campus
What you gone do now?
I'm no longer confused but don't tell anybody
I'm about to break the rules but don't tell anybody
I got something better than school but don't tell anybody
My momma would kill me so don't tell anybody
She wants me to get a good ass job just like everybody
She ain't walked in my shoes I'm just not everybody
