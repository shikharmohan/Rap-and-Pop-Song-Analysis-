Yeah, yeah, yeah, aye
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
I say still I stand, aye
And shawty here I am
Neva have ya seen in ya lifetime
A more divine southern rapper
Wit a swag like mine
Facin' all kind of time
But smile like I'm fine
Brag with such passion
And shine without trying
Believe me, pain's a small thing to a giant
I was born without a dime
Out tha gutta I climbed
Spoke my mind
And didn't stutter one time
Ali say even the greatest
Gotta suffer some time
So I huff and puff rhymes
Lyrics so sick wit it
Set the standard in Atlanta
How to get get get it
So you up and coming rappers
Wanna dis just kill it
I'm officially the realest
Point blank period
Whether I still live in the hood or juss visit
Whateva you can do in the hood I done did it
That's why the dope boys and the misfits feel it
This still his city as long as Tip living nigga
I ain't dead
(Naw)
I ain't done
(Naw)
I ain't scared
(Of what?)
I ain't run
(From who?)
But still I stand
(Yeah)
No matter what people
Here I am
(Yeah)
No matter what, remember
I ain't break
(Neva)
I ain't fold
(Neva)
They hate me mo'
(So!)
Yeah I know
(Haha)
Here I go
(Yeah)
No matter what shawty, here I go
(Haha)
No matter what shawty
You let the blog sites and the magazines tell it
I'm sure to be in jail till 2027
Rather see me in a cell
Instead of this new McLaren
God'll take you through hell just to get you to heaven
So even though it's heavy, the load I will carry
Grin and still bear it
Win and still share it
Apologies to the fans, I hope you can understand it
Life can change ya directions
Even when you ain't planned it
All you can do is handle it
The worst thing you could do is panic
Use it to your advantage
Avoid insanity, manage to conquer
Every obstacle, make impossible possible
Even when winning's illogical
Losing's still far from optional
Yeah they wanna see you shot up in the hospital
But when life throw punches, block ya counter like a boxer do
Been locked inside mi casa too long
I did a song to make it known that the king lives on, pimpin'
I ain't dead
(Naw)
I ain't done
(Naw)
I ain't scared
(Of what?)
I ain't run
(From who?)
But still I stand
(Yeah)
No matter what people
Here I am
(Yeah)
No matter what, remember
I ain't break
(Neva)
I ain't fold
(Neva)
They hate me mo'
(So)
Yeah I know
(Haha)
Here I go
(Yeah)
No matter what, shawty here I go
(Haha)
No matter what shawty
Even in solitude, there's still no hotter dude
I show you how to do what you do
You ain't got a clue
All you do is follow dudes
Sound like a lot of dudes
I weather whateva storm
Make it out without a bruise
I understand why, now wit my hands tied
Dey take shots cause if I'm out there it's a landslide
But revenge is best served as a cold dish
And suckas will get served nigga, no shit
Guess it was understood, for me it was over with
But I don't quit if ya ain't notice yet
They couldn't wait to say good night shawty
So they can try to rhyme, act and look like shawty
Go get a beat from Toomp and make a hook like shawty
Before ya know it I'm back, what it look like shawty?
I lost my partna and my daughter in the same year
Somehow I rise above my problems and remain here
Yeah and I hope the picture painted clear
If ya heart filled with faith then ya can't fear
Wonder how I face years and I'm still chillin'?
Easy, let go and let God deal wit it
I ain't dead
(Naw)
I ain't done
(Naw)
I ain't scared
(Of what?)
I ain't run
(From who?)
But still I stand
(Yeah)
No matter what people
Here I am
(Yeah)
No matter what, remember
I ain't break
(Neva)
I ain't fold
(Neva)
They hate me mo'
(So)
Yeah I know
(Haha)
Here I go
(Yeah)
No matter what shawty, here I go
(Haha)
No matter what shawty
