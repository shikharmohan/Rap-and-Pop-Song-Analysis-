Yeah, Big Snoop Dogg, X to the Z
Uncle L, blast these bitch ass motherfuckers
Pour your dom on the floor, try to flow with me
Duke 'em raw with them whores, hide ya hoes from me
Your momma wanna chase, I'm just statin' the fact
L.A. think about your broad, all I want is the stacks
Cats flashin' in my face is who I'm laughin' at
So you made a little dough but watchu doin' wit that?
Thought 'cha girl ain't feelin' me, why she grillin' me, Black?
Admit I'm the man or else I'll twist ya uterus back
On my lap, in the jet to Miami an' back
When I tear through new school, all y'all records is whack
I'm from Q, for Quiet Killers an' you know I deliver
The double N, enough ammo for every nigga
S, that spell Queens, stupid ass, run it back
That HBO shit, I must address that
Once an' for all, what's my opinion on Jamie Foxx?
He pussy, pussy ain't funny as Chris Rock
U can't fuck wit me
I don't care about your imagery
Give a fuck who you claim to be
U still can't fuck wit me
U can't fuck wit me
I don't care about your imagery
Give a fuck who you claim to be
U still can't fuck wit me
No, go, who you thought it was?
Don't be fuckin' wit my Uncle
'Cuz one does up dick, the pen in my streets go one way
I kill 'em 'In Living Color' on 'Any Given Sunday'
They all anxious to be waitin' to see how ill is my style
An' if it enough to make Kevin Lyle spit this out right now
An' get 'em with Juvenile, feed pitbull puppies
Bologna in the projects, you wanna die next?
Nah, he wanna live an' he loves his kids
We got this rap game on lock, like a cake rock
Gimme the key, run up in your spot
Like you on your belly, gimme the key
What is it gon' be, what it's gon' see?
When your blutter don't mean an' if he keep tryna wipe it off
Like, "Nigga, what's this song mean?"
L got 'em cornered, bitch, why you speak like that?
Tattooed 'Def Jam' under your wing like that
What, you a rider? Not in my house, mouth
Glad to escape down south to my Miami house
An' fifty spring in the couch
U can't fuck wit me
I don't care about your imagery
Give a fuck who you claim to be
U still can't fuck wit me
U can't fuck wit me
I don't care about your imagery
Give a fuck who you claim to be
U still can't fuck wit me
Let's play a game of 'Big bank take little bank'
Big dank take little dank
I average ninety-five in the paint
We comin' down like a shank
I know you wanna ride but you can't
We all up in your shit like a shank
Don't make me stop an' pull brakes
Ya two downs are lookin' cool, freakin' a sound
Yo, I get fucked up an' terrorize the town
I'm the circus ring master, so fuck the clowns
I bust lyrics an' rounds at the Lyricist Lounge
'Lost an' Found', a new identity, from here to infinity
God have mercy on all my enemies
Don't even test, waste your breath or your energy
Knock ya whole family off like the Kennedy's
I'm pledge, sicker than age with no type of remedy
Makin' niggas retire but reclaim disability
Agility, keepin' y'all outta the state penitentiary
U can't fuck wit me
I don't care about your imagery
Give a fuck who you claim to be
U still can't fuck wit me
U can't fuck wit me
I don't care about your imagery
Give a fuck who you claim to be
U still can't fuck wit me
Look, nigga, I regulate, bake the cake
Shake the fake, while keepin' my faith
Demonstratin' from the funk shit to the H
I bring the bread to the meat, so put the funk on the plate
You weedin' at my table, did you say your grace?
You say the wrong thing an' Imma smack your face
Chase these niggas, erase these niggas
You done fucked up 'cuz I'm break these niggas
Spray them, liquidate 'em, fade 'em all
Suckers, I hate 'em, laws, I pay them off
Big Dogg in this motherfuckin' bar
Wit Uncle L, don't tell Baby Dogg, "Yes, y'all"
We do this with no flaws
I love my bitch wit no drawers an' no bras
No laws, we break 'em from the get-go
Slidin' by, ridin' high when we get-go
Love it or leave it, we love livin' illegal
Servin' or swervin' in a '85 Regal
Look here, bitch, you ain't a motherfuckin' Beagel
I take off on your ass like an eagle
Wherever we go, we stay connected with my peoples
Just in case a motherfucker wanna G Funk
Two of the homies an' one of 'em got a piece on
An' they never hesitate to dissolve
