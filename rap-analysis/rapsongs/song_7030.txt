Yo check it out this is the boy Wyclef from translators
I'm coming from the Booga basement with a roots drink in my hands
So put the roots tonics in the air, yeah
'Cause I'm a start this one off like this
'Cause niggaz are living like there ain't no tomorrow
I nuked this on the S nine hundred, 'cause I couldn't afford
A eleven hundred I'm a start this one a little something like this
Here we go
Hey yo people you're living like there ain't no tomorrow
You get caught in the terra as Sodom and Gomorrah
Father, forgive him for he know not what he done
When the bum search for drums
The son search for condoms
He seek no, with his ring but with his head
That leave many dead In hospital beds
Now you and death are newlywed
So before I enter the tunnel I step back and shake it
Is it world the death or better life in a casket
Destuction of the flesh, news reporter wasn't coming
The devil cursed him cause he couldn't follow Ten Commandments
Living like there ain't no tomorrow
You're living like there ain't no tomorrow
You're living like there ain't no tomorrow
You open up your eyes and them was Sodom and Gomorrah
Living like there ain't no tomorrow
You're living like there ain't no tomorrow
You're living like there ain't no tomorrow
Open up your eyes
I called up the VP, she told me she was busy watching TV with Roxy
I told her I was coming, she said "That ain't necessary"
Three's a crowd, so what's the philosophy?
Another girl trying to take my girl away from me, easy
Fuck the door, I jumped through the window
Somewhere over the rainbow paranable
And the bitch still in my home
Stick stick in your socket, I sacrifice you like a live rabbit
Fatal attraction the coffin's the cabinet
'Cause in the 90's the girls got pricks
So keep the light on and make sure that the chick don't that back
She said that she did it with some girl named Lisa
I said what's the boot yo, she pulled the camcorder
Bust it, so what's the charge, you called me a womanizor?
I tried to say sorry, she said "Say sorry for Taquisha"
Chairs come flying my way like balls at basketball practice
Call the priest 'cause she's turning to the exorcist
She kicked me out 'cause she was paying for the apartment
That's real, you got no girl, if you got no money to spend
But she had loved me for my mind and my poetic skills
But now I'm checking magazings and getting cheap thrills
Asking myself when will it end?
'Cause when it came to sex
My hand was my best friend
I'm living like there ain't no tomorrow
I'm living like there ain't no tomorrow
I'm living like there ain't no tomorrow
Open up my eyes and them was Sodom and Gomorrah
Living like there ain't no tomorrow
Living like there ain't no tomorrow
Living like there ain't no tomorrow
Open up my eyes
I had a cousin like a brother, he tried to play me undercover
He said I didn't bang her, but the girl was his secret lover
But I played stupid like my brain had no minerals
It's so hard to say goodbye we singing in the funeral
Girls smash it up easy, when they know they got the bugsy
He used to sleep alone, but now he's riding Mrs. Daisy
You save all my business, my life's my life, my knife's my knife
So I be the lion that guards the trife
But at the party, I still move my waistline
A girl approached me and she asked me for the time
I said no disrespect, but check the watch on your wrist
And if you're looking for a hit check Charles Bronson from Death Wish
Then all of a sudden her man pushed me from the back
I turned out real cool I said "Why did you do that?"
The name is Clef, Clef Bon
Then mark my word that I'm a break your fucking arm
Unless you apologize and pick on someone your size
Not too cookoo hit you but the four to the five
Point it to your nose
Now your blood turns to snow
I'm living like there ain't no tomorrow
Living like there ain't no tomorrow
I'm living like there ain't no tomorrow
I'm living like there ain't no tomorrow
Open up my eyes and them was Sodom and Gomorrah
Living like there ain't no tomorrow
I'm living like there ain't no tomorrow
I'm living like there ain't no tomorrow
Open up my eyes yeah
