This song, does not contain, explicit lyrics
But the thought is erotic
Aww baby
Access to her cove, lovestruck Dove is Dove's mode
Took a look, dropped my books, Jenifa, oh Jenny
Breakfast was our greetings, yoghurts and birdseed's what I fed
Slipped a note, "Rock my yacht, Jenifa, oh Jenny"
Jenny only thought about Jimmy, but didn't think about Derwin
The Jimmy who's only a virgin
Steady we go, Jenifa led, pluggin' a tune which freedom well said
So what's the fix, O Jenifa, can a brother with soul get swingin'?
The Downstairs where we met, I'd brought records, she'd cassettes
Lost a break, found her shake, Jenifa, oh Jenny
Transcripts showed more than flirt, "I love daisies" read her shirt
Grabbed my jeans, Jimmy screamed, Jenifa, oh Jenny
Morals shaped like the floss, no-one could live their life for Pos
Found her house, aroused my joust, Jenifa, oh Jenny
Her clothes I did shuck, just like Dan I strictly stuck
To the punt, she cried "Kick it", Posdnous was in
Jenny only thought about Jimmy, but asked was I a virgin
Like some kid named Derwin?
She said, "Let's try it in the bathroom", but the 'nous is way above sinks
So to the kitchen, she did Dan and came back wrapped in Saran
Positions, muscles flexed, Dove was lost in a Ghana hex
Passed her test, felt her teddy, Jenifa, oh Jenny
Notions soothed the mood, Dove was lost in De La Heaven
Scream Plug 2, did the do, Jenifa, oh Jenny
Jenny, teased my homeboy Granny, in fact she teased so many
She was known as a garden tool
Did her thing while I plugged once, hope she don't fall fat 9 months
From now, I'll tell you what, Trugoy ain't ready
Worned out was my cater, mind you, this was 3 days later
The door turned blue, you guess who, Jenifa, oh Jenny
Advanced to the radio, Teddy persuaded us to turn off the light
Wanted me to rhyme while she wrapped me up in a ball of twine
No more I dispatch, was it Jimmy had met his match?
Or could it be the realisation, all girls owned a Jenny?
For normal health, I have fought, a valuable lesson she hath taught
Don't flaunt that the candy is good unless you came with plenty
