Lord live within my heart
Lord don't You ever stop
Fill me up with what I need
Just have to ask I shall receive
Lord live within my heart
Lord don't You ever stop
Fill me up with what I need
Just have to ask I shall receive
Look, look
Ba-bi-di-ba-bi dang-a-dang-diggy
How many rappers can actually hang with me?
My style is that Kris-style, it's witty
In they style, I have no more faith like Biggie
I battle on many levels, I shatter so many devils
'Fore you challenge me you better know the essentials
It's the K to the R, to the S, to the uno
You know, if you don't know your crew know
When you hear the thunderin' sound, you under the ground
You can tell by the way we jumpin' around
It's the teacher breakin' it down
I'm an upright MC, these others they be crawlin' around, word
Lord live within my heart
Lord don't You ever stop
Fill me up with what I need
Just have to ask I shall receive
Lord live within my heart
Lord don't You ever stop
Fill me up with what I need
Just have to ask I shall receive
Yeah, yeah, word up, look, look
You know when the teacher returns, just get ready to learn
Just get ready to earn, health, love, awareness and money to burn
I'm not really concerned how the Benz just turn, 'round the corner
For our sons and daughters to yearn, stand firm
If you lookin' at these hooks you becomin' a mad worm
Danglin' from the pole of the fisher, the corporate fisher
The talent scout and no doubt ready to get ya
Lord live within my heart
Lord don't You ever stop
Fill me up with what I need
Just have to ask I shall receive
Look, look, look, look
I'm anything but regular, not even similar
I get rid of the sin in ya when I spit at ya, my new literature
Now who forever been with ya? The teacher
Who remembers the kid in ya? The teacher
I'm winnin' ya, or winnin' a convert when the rhyme splurt at the concert
Forget the times that hurt, if the mind's alert let the mind work
Uh, let the body divert
To get to the top of the mountain, you've got to climb dirt
So c'mon climb through, don't get stuck lookin' behind you
It'll blind you, however I'm here to remind you
Many of you lost, you've got to find you
You'll be found you simply by you finding you, c'mon
Lord live within my heart
Lord don't You ever stop
Fill me up with what I need
Just have to ask I shall receive
Lord live within my heart
Lord don't You ever stop
Fill me up with what I need
Just have to ask I shall receive
Lord live within my heart
Lord don't You ever stop
Fill me up with what I need
Just have to ask I shall receive
Lord live within my heart
Lord don't You ever stop
Fill me up with what I need
Just have to ask I shall receive
