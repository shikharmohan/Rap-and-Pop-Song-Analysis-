Baby, understand me now
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel?
When everythin' goes wrong, you see some bad
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Misunderstood, ain't gotta be explained
But you don't understand me, so let me explain
Stood in the heat, the flames, the snow
Please slow down hurricane
The wind blow, my dreads swang
He had hair like wool, like Wayne
Droppin' ashes in the Bible
I shake 'em out and they fall on the rifle
Scary, Hail Mary no tale fairy
All real very, extraordinary
Perry Mason facin' the barrel if he tattle
My God is my judge, no gown, no gavel
I'm a rebel, down to battle
Now or never, I would never [unverified]
Fuckin' fantastic, fuck if you agree
But I don't give a fuck if you see me
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
What's understood ain't gotta be explained
So for those who understand, meet Dwayne
For 8 and a half months I gave Ms. Cita the pain
Now, it's Young Money, baby, keep the change
My mama say fuck 'em and we the same
So, hello mothafucka, you got some sheets to change
And ain't it funny how people change
Like Easter Sunday, you know church fit then outfit
Bright pink and green chest look house lit
Bright pinky rin's but that ain't about this, what you 'bout bitch?
Excuse my French, emotion in my passion
But I wear my heart on my sleeve like it's the new fashion
What are you askin'?
If I don't have the answer it's probably on the web
Like I'm a damn Tarantula but I know you don't understand
'Cause you thought Lil Wayne is Weezy but Weezy is Dwayne
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
I was watchin' T.V. the other day, right
Got this white guy up there talkin' about black guys
Talkin' about how young black guys are targeted
Targeted by who? America
You see 1 in every 100 Americans are locked up
1 in every 9 black Americans are locked up
And see what the white guy was tryin' to stress was that
The money we spend on sendin' a mothafucka to jail
A young mothafucka to jail
Would be less to send his or her young ass to college
See, and another thin' the white guy was stressin'
Was that our jails are populated with drug dealers
You know crack cocaine, stuff like that
Meanin' due to the laws we have
On crack cocaine and regular cocaine
Police are only, I don't want to say only, right
But shit, only logic by ridin' around
In the hood all day and not in the suburbs
Because crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood
And you know the other thin' is mostly found in
You know where I'm goin'
But why brin' a mothafucka to jail
If it's not gon' stand up in court
'Cause this drug ain't that drug
You know level 3, level 4 drug, shit like that
I guess it's all a misunderstandin', I sit back and think
You know us young mothafuckas, you know that 1 in 9
We probably only sellin' the crack cocaine
Because we in the hood
And it's not like in the suburb
We don't have what you have, why?
I really don't wanna know the answer
I guess we just misunderstood huh?
You know we don't have room in the jail now
For the real mothafuckas, the real criminals
Sex offenders, rapists serial killers
Don't get scared, don't get scared
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
