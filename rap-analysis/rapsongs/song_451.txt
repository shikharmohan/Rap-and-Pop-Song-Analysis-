Yeah, yeah, Bone Thugs
You know a nigga been all over the world, man
Australia, China, Africa, England
  (It's the same shit everywhere I go, you know)
Why does everybody's story seem to sound the same?
(It all seems so familiar)
Struggle in the game
(It all seems so familiar)
They left the hood for change
(It all seems so familiar)
Why does everybody's story seem to sound the same?
(It all seems so familiar)
Then left some time in vain
(It all seems so familiar)
Gotta wise, the shit that lame
(It all seems so familiar)
I can remember that little nigga when he was just a young lad
Nobody thought he make it up outta the hood, before the gun blast
'Cause shorty wanted to be a thug, runnin' from cops out on the block
The boy was hot and didn't give a fuck
  (Scandalous)
Runnin' up in that black mask, niggas if you got cash
Drop it off in that bag and make craps fast
Destroyin' the system, make some money to survive the streets
But you know deep inside that this ain't how you tryna be
But it's all to think when you're strugglin' and can't sleep
'Cause you're hungry but can't eat, 'cause livin' just ain't free
But shit, Pappa been laid off, Mamma been laid off
Everywhere I here the same old song
Why does everybody's story seem to sound the same?
(It all seems so familiar)
Struggle in the game
(It all seems so familiar)
They left the hood for change
(It all seems so familiar)
Why does everybody's story seem to sound the same?
(It all seems so familiar)
Then left some time in vain
(It all seems so familiar)
Gotta wise, the shit that lame
(It all seems so familiar)
To probably take a loss, I'm tryna fight these demons
By any means, by any cost, I'm out here reppin' Cleveland
They got me bobbin, weavin', nigga, give me the reason
To let 'em flies do or die, niggas no longer breathin'
Known as a heathen before Layzie Bone it was Steven
And I'm just tryna break even, leavin' you leakers steadily creepin'
Shit get deep when Daddy gone
And Momma can't do it on her own
Lights off, gas gone, Momma, Daddy comin' home?
I guess not, sell rocks, rappin' with my niggas Bone
(Wassup Wish? Yeah, we all we got)
And that's Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone
  (Wassup Kray? Yeah, we all we got, nigga)
And that's Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone
Why does everybody's story seem to sound the same?
(It all seems so familiar)
Struggle in the game
(It all seems so familiar)
They left the hood for change
(It all seems so familiar)
Why does everybody's story seem to sound the same?

Seen anybody get shot? Me too, you ever been shot? Me too
Sold rocks, all nighters on blocks, catch a case? Shit, me too
That's my story, no more ridin', nobody can tell it for me
Momma workin' double shift, Daddy, who? Daddy, who?
And when he do, it's always later, never came, damn luck
He done broke that boy's heart, man, again, damn again
Don't wonder why it's like that in the ghetto
Grew up outta luck, don't give a fuck about life, so we let 'em go
I know my heart is cold, you know how them ghetto children grow
Give me the money and I can keep my tempers low
Everybody knows love, clubs, cars and hoes
Priorities fucked up, but we already know
Why does everybody's story seem to sound the same?
(It all seems so familiar)
