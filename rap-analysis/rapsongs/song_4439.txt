Yeah, we can talk, she'd rather fuss
This and that 'bout such and such
Man, damn, where is the fuckin' trust?
I'm tired of the hoot and hollerin'
I'm 'bout to take the coupe to Collins
Then take a female to the island
Then take her clothes off and do the 'inas
Yeah, now she harem with them other bitches
I told 'em mind her fuckin' business
Said she probably out there fuckin' niggas
I'm fuckin' her friends, now her friends ain't even fuckin' with her
Damn, she text me all day and night
So pissed off, she ain't even spellin' shit right
I text her back and tell her it's life
Now somebody tell them ho's I'm single for the night
Yeah, I'm single
Nigga had to cancel that bitch like Nino
I ain't trippin' on nothin', I'm sippin' on somethin'
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me
And I'm single, yeah, I'm single
And I'm single, tonight I'm single
And I ain't trippin' on nothin', I'm sippin' on somethin'
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me tonight
Uh, dreads braided to the back
I'm chillin' but my swag on full attack
And my girl actin' like a brat
So when she call, I don't answer, I just write her back
She hate it when I do that shit
And when I get home she go through my shit
She call numbers back to see who that is
Man, I hate it when she do that shit
Polo t-shirt, Polo drawers
Now make me take this Polo off
Girl, you can get broken off

Swimmin' trunks and bathing suits
Then go in the bedroom and tell the naked truth
Don't want to fuss, ain't tryin' to fight
Man, somebody tell 'em ho's I'm single for the night
Y-yeah, I'm single

And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me tonight
Now she got on her "fuck 'em" dress
And I got on my double-breast
And he been fussin' all day with her
And I make her feel special like a place kicker
She want to be Weezy F. Babysitter
Say she wish she could cut my dick off and take it with her
I say hold up, she say she just playin'
Then I falls in that pussy like quicksand
Uh, hot sex and cold wine
She left that nigga hangin' like a clothes line
I cut my phones off, both lines
It's about to get nasty, pork rinds
She came hard, both times
We both say we single and we both lyin'
We both frown, but it feel right
Put your hands up if you're single for the night
