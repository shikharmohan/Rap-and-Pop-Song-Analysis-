[PRODIGY AND HAVOC TALKING] 
That the Way thun... 
...My man...Gotta keep your mouth tight ... 
[PRODIGY] 
Hey yo its hell on earth down here the pavement scorching 
Its more on roc when the Mobb walks in 
shit gets hot like a ill potty grill spilled on you 
Spit fire with nines but never squealed on you 
I understood you should try to take my life 
If I was you I would too damn right 
If I had drama with a nigga like such as myself 
I couldn't even sleep at night until... 
I made things right 
Pull out guns exchange a fight 
Be the first to let off mines ignite the pipes... 
and never let the daylight decieve 
during the suns' hours niggaz do bleed 
Aim for the waist and something on the top gets shot 
Niggaz can't shoot never made a thing drop 
Keep cream of the crop 
fresh out of box shit filled to the top 
Smell the barrell when its bolt-locked nigga 
Hook1 
Have you ever lost a loved one? 
Or never understood love 'til you lost one? 
Where your heart at? 
I left mines behind with my dearly departed 
Where your heart at? Strength missing 
To take losses is the hardest 
The ones that overcome be the calmest 
Strive regardless. Where your heart at? Brave-hearted. 
Now lets find out where niggaz hearts' at 
This is to my physical you gone...to me you still here 
I be buggin thinking how you doin' up there 
Probably watching over me calling out my fouls 
Fuck with mad chicks but I take care of my child 
I miss that ass tell God I said pardon me 
If Your real; He'll forgive me [no doubt] 
But I ain't crying no more about how you're gone 
Used to hold me down niggaz front its on 
Ain't wetting going to jail you better shoot me 
Just lost my heart-If I die you comin' wit' me

Stand but please don't point call me paranoid 
But I'm on point close by the stash joint Got you in my mind 
I guess thats why the say love is blind

[PRODIGY] 
I find myself dozing off with it [guns] 
waking up every forty minutes [dun] 
Soaking wet dripped to death in it 
On top of rules big barells and tools get tested 
And hittin off makes my dick get erected 
We all strive for a better tommorow 
But as far as today your ass gotsa' pay 
And ain't no time better than the present one at hand 
And never keep your shit too far from your hand 
[HAVOC] 
Think about this are you with your hands on who you running with 
Some timers, Playa' hata's and dick riders 
Bent niggaz' that be crashin into dividers 
Gettin you into shit got that ass hud up 
Got them la'd up got you comin out of your vault 
With no plans of giving back live in serious debt. 
Your lady fucking other niggaz you a fool for her 
Talking 'bout you got money you just using her 
Actually loosin' her...
