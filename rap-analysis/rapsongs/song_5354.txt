Ya, don't talk
I know there's somebody out there who had a nasty, nasty, nasty friend
They wanna go around humpin' everybody
Can I get a ho? Huh, you know what I'm sayin'?
So I'm gonna talk about this one I had a few years ago, ah ha
I had a friend named Cutie Tootie
Tootie turned tricks to get some Gucci
Known as Loose Bootie
Truly, she was a freak in the evenin'
And if she wasn't teasin', then give me one reason
Why she do that? Always knew that
She was hot as the nectar
Hector said he pecked her, disrespected her
'Cause he bang, bang swang in his dingalang
Broke his back long range and make the ugly bitch sing
Ooh, ooh, why you hurtin' me?
Tell me why more?
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, why you hurtin' me?
Tell me why more?
Ooh, ooh
Cutie Tootie with her sight
And if she humped Ralph, she humped Bobby, Ricky and Mike
Tight, is the way she wore her dresses
Has she learned her lesson from all the dick testing?
Now I'm guessin', she's layin' in a casket, in a yellow basket
For a Gucci jacket
Daggit, I wish she didn't do those nasty things
'Cause he made the ugly bitch sing
Ooh, ooh, why you hurtin' me?
Tell me why more?
Ooh, ooh, ayy, ayy
Ooh, ooh, why you hurtin' me?
Tell me why more?
Ooh, ooh
Tootie didn't know the facts of life
Stayin' up in clinics, Loosy Bootie mad trife
Feelin', she got the heeby geebies
Quick to give you freebies
Underneath the staircase in Brooklyn
Neighbors out the window sure was lookin'
She greasy like chicken
I don't give a cotton pick and she can do her thing
'Cause me and her don't hang, the ugly bitch sang
Ooh, ooh, why you hurtin' me?
Tell me why more?
Ooh, ooh, ayy, ayy
Ooh, ooh, why you hurtin' me?
Tell me why more?
Ooh, ooh, ayy, ayy
Ooh, ooh, why you hurtin' me?
Tell me why more?
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, why you hurtin' me?
Tell me why more?
Ooh, ooh
So, you know what?
This should be a lesson for anybody
Who's hangin' with someone who's dirty, nasty, stank
Once again, goin' around humpin' everybody
Everybody and anybody and anything
That's why you make the ugly bitch sing
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
