Yea, Amerikaz motherfuckin' nightmare bitch
They wanna know, where the hood at, nigga we right here
Live in the flesh, with the Tec's and never scared
Them guns we holdin, claustrophobic, we'll let 'em air
Dump dump, reloaded Amerikaz nightmare

Dogs, I think smarter, reach harder
Slugs travel much farther
Nigga stompin' a Timberland wearing, face carver
With the box cutter, top gutter
I'll hover over you lames, run for cover, into your brain yea
You did your thang but, not very good
And by the, looks of things, you can't come back to the hood
This is not a good look for you my nigga
What's really poppin', inquirin' minds wanna know
How you rockin' them, new guns, we cope those
In bulk, like we bought 'em in Cosco's
Don't get yaself murked, wet shirt
Said it first, hurry this that red alert
You ain't gotta get bucked to know that this led'll hurt
The sight of my hammer, gotcha heart pumping
Nerves twitching, eyes jumping, heads will roll
When the pound starts kicking
You be missing
Mom's will be wearing that yellow ribbon
While I'm somewhere in the Caimen islands, chillin, nigga
They wanna know, where the hood at, nigga we right here
Live in the flesh, with the Tec's and never scared
Them guns we holdin, claustrophobic, we'll let 'em air

Yo you know we keep them big thangs
That make dead people when we hit brains
It's a wrap for the sequel get yo whip sprayed
Tho I rather hit you walkin', get yo shit shaved
Plus showered up, talkin' then we split, ey
Won't catch me gun smokin', have the cops think
It was drugs that provoke it while we rollin', ey
Baby girl, I see you, can I get a taste of that thang
Heard its lethal in a good way
Just so you know I ain't the one that get yo clit ate
But hope you got a strong back, I'll make yo shit break
You'll be walking like a penguin for a few days
Yo bitch, you know we got big cash
Money fallin' out our pockets, give you whiplash
When we drive past your projects, ain't nobody can stop us
Infamous they can't stop us, they want our spot
Yo fall back nigga we got this
They wanna know, where the hood at, nigga we right here
Live in the flesh, with the Tec's and never scared
Them guns we holdin, claustrophobic, we'll let 'em air

I got love for my niggaz, love for my niggaz
Love for my niggaz, got love for my niggaz
I bust slugs for my niggaz, slugs for my niggaz
Slugs for my niggaz, bust slugs for my niggaz
Yo slugs touchin', medics will rush 'em
Jake dusting for prints, make shift, morgue made for you pricks
You know what stay on my hip, you know the hood that I rep
You know we dumpin' them clips, you in the valley of death
Get comfortable nigga, you runnin' out of breath
Ya blood is spilling through the sealing of the necks
Floor or have you flood the cement
Outside somewhere on the streets, no longer in the flesh
They wanna know, where the hood at, nigga we right here
Live in the flesh, with the Tec's and never scared
Them guns we holdin, claustrophobic, we'll let 'em air
Dump dump, reloaded Amerikaz nightmare
