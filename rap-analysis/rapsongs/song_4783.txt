His realm is a new horizon of cuts
They expand from his hand as he conducts
Aim a lot of cool projects not photography
Cut-Creator, Philly-Phil's biography
The lyrical virtuoso makes his return
All adversaries should be concerned
LL Cool J is back again
Allow me to introduce you to my friend Cut-Creator
He circumcises DJ's when he's on the airwaves
Til the mission's complete, you're a musical slave
English revision he endure any collision
Like a surgeon with a scalpel, he'll make an incision
As for me I'll annihilate, eggs, I'll excommunicate
You from rappin' and my lyrics are the best
Slow down the rap but not the subject matter
All you sucker DJ's will scatter
Cut-Creator will employ techniques that will absorb toy boy
The real helper of cuts, Cut-Creator is his name
The boy's so nice, my focus was strained
You could re-arrange but you don't have the brains
To arrange scratch-padders for the audio change
Not trippin', I'm a tree of fundamental geometry
Just Cool J, that's me, I'm dangerous
I need a beat
Yeah I made it, don't look astonished
I had to remind you of what I accomplished
My scenario, four-door stereo, up-beatin' beat, zero is the ratio
Cut-Creator, LL Cool J, say "Ole" to what we just played
Rappers who don't evade instead we invade
And all competitors will be slayed
Any comment is a compliment
No group's talent can be the equivalent of mine and his combined
Total harmony between the cuts and the rhyme
So why listen the greats by the deaf of the bass
Takin' out every sucker, DJ in the place
A performance underrated is not narrated
So Cut-Creator's social status can't be elevated
He's dangerous
Demolishin' DJ's in under a second
I quote an old phrase from my last record
The beat elevates, the scratch excels
Except I came here to raise some hell
Searchin' up sykes and cuts like a blade
He could squeeze a dry sponge and make Kool-Aid
I'll keep it steady, the record turns many
Instead of a needle, he uses a machete
He scuffs the bars to get you involved as the record revolves
DJ's dissolve, musically, physically, mentally
He's an innovator, greater, Cut-Creator is on the crossfader
Sometimes I gotta check what I invest
On Farmer's Boulevard is where I rest
I'm numero uno, amigo with an ego
[Incomprehensible] francais an' italiano
The mouth projects and I'll inject into your ears
A new concept cuts soon in silence to be unveiled
To the Cool J phenomena, all must hail
I'm dangerous
