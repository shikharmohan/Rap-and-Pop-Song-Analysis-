How did you know I've been waiting for this time to come?
And though it tastes like forever it may not stay long
Everywhere is summer, everywhere is summer
Everywhere is summer, everywhere is summer
A shaman since before my birth
And I came down to rock the earth
My mission condition
I give you, you listen
I'm syncing in time in parallel
In binary, no third return
I'm planning intention
With all the redemption
How did you know I've been waiting for this time to come?
And though it tastes like forever it may not stay long
Everywhere is summer, everywhere is summer
Everywhere is summer, everywhere is summer
No pop, no pop, no pop, no pop
We gon' do this thang till the sky just drop
Lock in to ya mind away we rock
In a rocket is the eighty seventh astronaut
Top of the soul, dove and I got in a hole
At the moment they were sayin' it was outa control
Strap in to your mind, why eyes see some recline
You'll see in time your season to shine
When the stadium is dark, MCs are defined
Get ready, on your mark, put your feet on the line
The race is on to space beyond
You gon' get there by doin' what you want
Sometimes the most famous feel all alone
So we drift to a place that we call our home
I was known as being spaced and outta my dome
Now I know, it's all I've known
How did you know I've been waiting for this time to come?
And though it tastes like forever it may not stay long
Everywhere is summer, everywhere is summer
Everywhere is summer, everywhere is summer
