It all began on the street, to the back of a blue police vehicle
Next come the bookends, the way things is looking
It's Friday, you in for a long stay, gettin' shackled on the bus
First thing come Monday, hoping in your mind you'll be released one day
But knowing, home is a place you're not going for a long while
Now you're up on the isle
In a position that you ain't got to, refusing to smile
But keep in mind there's a brighter day, after your time spent
Used to be wild, but locked up, you can't get bent
Thought you could hack it, now you're requesting Pee, see you fragile
It ain't hard to see, niggas like that don't associate with me
I'd rather, get busy to the third degree
'Cause the war populations are
If this was the street, my razor would be a mack demon
Hit you up, leave your whole face screaming, what you in for kid?
Busting nuts, taps heard of million street stories caught inside this trap
Who are you to look at me with your eyes like that?
Wising up young blood, before you make things escalate
And I would hate
To set your crooked ass straight
Make your moves at night, pack your heat in this war zone
Niggas is trife
Runnin' from one time, ain't no time to slip
Make one false move and it's a up north trip
Livin' the high life, make your moves at night
Pack your heat in this war zone
Niggas is trife, runnin' from one time, ain't no time to slip
Make one false move and it's a up north trip
You tried to dip, duck, but still got bucked, you talk too much shit
You should have kept your mouth shut, all that gossip
Motherfucker don't you know my glock kicks, hollow tips
To your body, mad toxic, I fade you, blow you with a rusty-ass razor
Did you a favor, tried to wet you but I grazed you
Pop goes the glock when there's beef on the block, chill for a while
Make them think the beef stop, then I creep like a thief in the night
It's only right, ain't no turnin' back, it's on tonight, and if I get caught
Then my ass is up north, straight on the course for upstate New York
Stress, smokin' back to back cigarettes, it popped off
Gon' point in the mess hall
But to avoid that from head to toe, dipped in all black, hit them niggas
Where they pump they cracks at, Havoc, with the murder masterplan
Keep my nine up to par, so my shit won't jam, God forbid if my shit do
Run behind a tree, fix my shit then hit you, slugs in your body
Mainly in your brain tissue, witness from the scene
Get ghost, stash the pistol
So simple then, watch my back, lay up and relax
Roll a sack, [unverified] K-A black? Find a shorty intact
Make your moves at night, pack your heat in this war zone
Niggas is trife
Runnin' from one time, ain't no time to slip
Make one false move and it's a up north trip
Livin' the high life, make your moves at night
Pack your heat in this war zone
Niggas is trife, runnin' from one time, ain't no time to slip
Make one false move and it's a up north trip
I got the powder, combine wit' the powder and water, it oughta
Drop in a half and hour in the form of oil, watch the cocaine boil
Keep my eye on it so the shit won't spoil, then I pause
And ask God why did he put me on the serve, just so I could die
I sit back and build on all the things I did wrong, why I'm still breathing
And all my friends gone, I try not to dwell on the subject for a while
'Cause I might get stuck in this corrupt lifestyle
But my heart pumps foul blood through my arteries
And I can't turn it back
It's a part of me, too late for cryin', I'm a grown man struggling
To reach the next level of life, without fumbling, down to folding
I got no shoulder to lean on but my own, all alone in this danger zone
Time waits for no man, the streets grow worse, fuck the whole world kid
My money comes first 'cause I'm out for the gusto, and trust nobody
If you're not family, then you die by me
'Cause niggas will have you locked up
The snitch, be a man, givin' police the run down on your plans
We're never goin' down like that, so I, shut my mouth
And hold my words back
The legal business, forever mine, fuck payin' taxes
The last kid that shitted
And gave police access to my blueprints
Used names as evidence
Skipped town and I haven't seen the snitch nigga ever since
The moral of the story is easy to figure out
A lesson that you can't live without
Livin' the high life, make your moves at night
Pack your heat in this war zone
Niggas is trife, runnin' from one time, ain't no time to slip
Make one false move and it's a up north trip
