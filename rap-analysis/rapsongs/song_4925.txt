I got my twin glock 40's cocked back
  (Rollout, rollout)
Me an' my homies, so drop that
  (Rollout, rollout)
We rollin' on twenties with the top back
  (Rollout, rollout)
So much money, you can't stop that
  (Rollout, rollout)
Twin glock 40's cocked back
  (Rollout, rollout)

Now where'd you get that platinum chain with them diamonds in it?
Where'd you get that matchin' Benz with them windows tinted?
Who dem girls you be with when you be ridin' through?
Man, I ain't got nothin' to prove, I paid my dues
Breakin' the rules, I shake fools while I'm takin' a cruise
Tell me who's your weed man an' how do you smoke so good?
You'se a superstar, boy, why you still up in the hood?
What in the world is in that bag, what you got in that bag?
A couple a cans of whoop ass, you did a good ass job
Of just eyein' me, spyin' me
I got my twin glock 40's cocked back
  (Rollout, rollout)
Me an' my homies, so drop that

Man, that car don't come out until next year
Where in the fuck did you get it?
That's eighty-thousand bucks gone, where in the fuck did you spend it?
You must have eyes on your back 'cause you got money to the ceiling
An' the bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin'
The better I'm feelin', the more that I'm chillin'
Willin', drillin' an' killin' the feelin'
Now who's that buck naked cook fixin' three-course meals?
Gettin' goosebumps when her body tap the six inch heels
What in the world is in that room, what you got in that room?
A couple a gats, a couple of knives
A couple of rats, a couple of wives, now it's time to choose
I got my twin glock 40's cocked back
  (Rollout, rollout)
Me an' my homies, so drop that
  (Rollout, rollout)
We rollin' on twenties with the top back
  (Rollout, rollout)

Are you custom-made, custom-paid or you just custom-fitted?
Play Station 2 up in the ride an' is that Lorenzo-kitted?
Is that your wife, your girlfriend or just yo' main bitch?
You take a pick while I'm rubbin' the hips
Touchin' lips to the top of the dick an' then whoo
Now tell me who's your housekeeper an' what you keep in yo' house?
What about diamonds an' gold, is that what you keep in yo' mouth?
What in the world is in that case, what you got in that case?
Get up out my face, you couldn't relate, wait to take place
At a similar pace, so shake, shake it
I got my twin glock 40's cocked back
  (Rollout, rollout)
Me an' my homies, so drop that
  (Rollout, rollout)
We rollin' on twenties with the top back

Get out my business, my business
Stay the fuck up out my business
'Cause these niggaz all up in my shit
An' it's my business, my business
Stay the fuck up out my business
'Cause it's mine, all mine
My business, my business
Stay the fuck up out my business
'Cause these niggaz all up in my shit
An' it's my business, my business
Stay the fuck up out my business
'Cause it's mine, all mine
