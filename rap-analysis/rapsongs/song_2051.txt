[Rage] 
All ways and forever forever and all ways 
the rhythm will flow from now and through all days 
as long as the sun shines 
as long as Eisenours on the dime 
yo I'll be kickin the rhyme 
One time for ya mind your soul your body 
D o g's on the side of me smooth as E & J 
hard as Bacardi smackin those yaddy yacks and ducks keep quackin 
hands that are clappin end up cracklin 
under the heat the pressure from the one thats deffer 
Egyptian ruler will call me cleo ro Nefertiti yes indeedi 
got the eyes of the beedie-body from Tahiti 
voice of the will lyrics blow 
chills up ya spine thats illslow 
all thoughts in ya mind drop a yo 
came in the front but you be kicked through the back door 
for tryin to step, tryin to come incorrect 
tryin to play the left, tryin to start a mess 
tryin to cause fuss, tryin to raise a ruckus...Huh 
you'll end up ashes to ashes, dusk to dusk 
a busta you musta been fuckin on drugs 
and alcohol back off, all a yall up against the wall 
spread em, doggs go get em and 
cuff em and stuff em, cold shed em dont let em 
not a word, not another one heard 
if you try you die, visions blurred, speech slurred 
served with a cherry on top 
Rage in effect I just begun to rock 
Yeah rock on witcha bad self R A G E! 
rock on witcha bad self R A G E ! 
Rock on witcha bad self R A G E ! 
Rock on witcha bad self....
