Dave, whattup man? It's me
Just callin' to see, if possible, if you have any time today
Or within the next couple of days
If, if, you're in the studio or if you're at home or car, whatever
That song, that, it's called trying or something
Mase was tellin' me that I needed to hear?
He said it was amazing
The way he was talkin', man, I wanna hear it
Am I just another lost in the pack?
We for shack ship, you know laugh it off
Years just blow by
My eyes stay fixed but the picture's kinda outta focus
I cry a lot but admit to it
Enjoyin' life now but I've been through it
Sometimes I wish that I can go back
No bills, no kids, just getting tore back
I want a wife, I love women
How could I front like I don't be in love wit 'em?
A li'l man that I can teach
A li'l sand but not the beach
I figure excess'll only bring
An excessive amount of fussin'
So when I'm gone, make sure
The head stone reads, 'He did it for us'
I'm like your modern day Jesus
I cherish warm thoughts like a gray goose
And float soft kisses to my baby
(Yo ain't that Dave's little girl?)
Yeah, respect her for that
She gon' be somebody instead of somebody-baby-mama
You see young minds are now made of armor
I'm tryin' to pop a hole in your Yankee cap absorb me
The skies over your head ain't safe no more
And Hip Hop ain't your own
And if it is then you fuckin' up the crib son
You make life look like I don't wanna live one
You might as well hold your breath until you die
In a corner somewhere bent over in the crevice
This God theory overcomes the worst of weathers
As long as you willin' to try, you on a good start, homie
You on a good start, see nigga tryin'
People are you ready?
Yes, we're ready
Are you really ready?
We wanna be ready
Ready for the change that may approach you?
Yes
Follow down the path that you supposed to?
Yes
People are you ready?
Yes, we're ready
Are you really ready to try?
We wanna try harder
You know mistakes are trials that we learn from?
Yes
I order to live life, you must earn one?
Yes
People are you ready?
Throughout my change to grow
Some of my people got left behind
They didn't listen for the gun
As I leaped from off the line
Thirteen years deep
In this marathon I'm runnin'
Paid dues and still got bills to pay
When I came back around the way
Old friends gave me dead eyes
And fake smiles, half wide
We were supposed to rid the world of danger
These days we nod heads and small talk like polite strangers
It's natural to fall off
Just land close to the tree
I'll be there if they need me to be
And I know all my local shorties
'Cuz they all know who I am
And lately wanna flip grammar instead of grams
Like that's the only choice they got
They tell me how they gonna shake up the game
But came to me to see if I could give 'em guidance for change
Shit y'all, I need guidance myself
And I chisel right words to make gems
Got fans around the world but my girl's no one of 'em
And my relationship's a big question
'Cuz my career's a clear hindrance to her progression
Said she needs a man and our kids need a father
I'm not at all ready to hear her say don't bother
And break
And this I know I can't take
But C. Smith said to hold on
My brother Luck said to hold on
My nigga Dave said to hold on
My nigga Mase said to hold on
Yo, Maseo, we need to hold on
Eh, yo, y'all we need to hold on
People are you ready?
Yes, we're ready
Well, what you wanna be?
We wanna be ready
Do you wanna lose hate for love?
Yes
Do you wanna see these gates above?
Yes
I said people are you ready?
Yes, we're ready
But are you willing to try?
We wanna try harder
Do you really wanna carry some weight?
Yes
Are you ready to design your fate?
Yes
Yo, people are you ready?
Yes, we're ready
Well, what you wanna be?
We wanna be ready
