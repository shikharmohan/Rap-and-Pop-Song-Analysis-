From 83rd street to way across town, cats knew how I got down, 'cause word got around, I was that robbery kid, with no gun and no mask, catcha nigga out the door slippin, that's your ass, didn't laugh much 'cause I didn't have much, life was like a stake, half gas half clutch, meanin half good and half bad, it was good if I caught a good vic, if I didn't I was bad, took it out all my records, I comes through and if niggaz was broke, I took watches and cellulars, went to jail a few times but that didn't stop me, all it taught me was how not to be sloppy, an older cat robbed me, when I was like 10, if anybody wanted to help, they should've did it then, if they didn't then all it did was release the beast, so imma feast on whatever I come across in the streets...

I had a, S on my chest, fuck the best, did robbery's for some cats and robbed the rest, other times I came through with just me n my dog, and clear out the whole fuckin block 'cause we went hard, I'm back, some niggaz I knew but some niggaz I didn't, I ain't give a fuck either way, it was no bullshittin, a cruddy nigga out to get money, an' a couple of slugs was the only thing anybody took from me, run up on them cats smooth like, put it in his left ear, gave up the money n the jewelery, or get left here, keep thinkin it's a game we're  playin let's get popped, see how much fun your havin when your heart beat stop, shut 'em down, open up shop, OH, NO, blew off a nigga top, somebody call the cops but it's too late, 'cause imma hitchu in the face, and what kills you is gonna be somethin that you aint...

If pain is love, why hide my pain with drugs, choke off haze, sell addicts coke for days, same clothes no soap or shade, and I still gotta gun on my hip, for your open grave, we used to get robbery fix, until our man, got killed for his whip, on some robbery shit, then I switched to the weed, and started sellin crack, without will I pull the steel and put a shell up in your back, I feel like all my life, I was held up in a trap, like if I go to heaven, maybe hell will want me back, when all I really want, is Spreewells up on the 'lac, and a mono big sittin, wit a head up in my lap, but since no dough don't spin, and my pants holes gots holes with them, I gotta fold ya men, it's obvious im in a house of sin, I wish I could open up the doors and let 'em blow with the wind...
