Yo yo what the fuck, man? Big L takin' over the streets
Flamboyant entertainment
What y'all bout to witness, Big L
My whole crew wild, the game is called rap
Other MCs, they ain't got a chance at all
My whole crew wild
What y'all bout to witness, Big L
My whole crew wild, the game is called rap
Other MCs, they ain't got a chance at all
My whole crew wild
Yo, I'm straight loco, to Hell with you an' your broke hoe
You ain't a big dog, you more like Toto, you got no dough
I smoke 'dro mixed with cocoa, strong as bolo
I pack a fo' fo', platinum ro ro, anti-homo, that's a no-no
So fuck po'po', I push the 740 an' not the Volvo
C town push the 600
I'm with a bitch on dolo, chips from here to Acapulco
While y'all buck for legs, I buck for heads
I even buck celebs, nigga, fuck the Feds
My underground niggaz, y'all can shine with me
Got my own label now, so y'all can sign with me
Y'all can take me from the bottom an' climb with me
That's fine with me, that's how it was designed to be
Aiyyo, gats we bust, backs we crush
Only hot tracks we lust, crazy stacks we clutch
An' we need plaques to touch that say platinum plus
'Cause half of you niggaz that's rappin' now is whack to us
Aiyyo, gats we bust, backs we crush
Only hot tracks we lust, crazy stacks we clutch
An' we need plaques to touch that say platinum plus
'Cause half of you niggaz that's rappin' now is whack to us
An' cats still wonder, can they get as hot as he been?
That probably depends, let me show you how to begin
Bang chicks in Marriott's, down to quality inns
Hit the bar, spend cash like Monopoly ends
Plushed out, rock gators an' exotical skins
Come in the hood, flippin' the chicken an' broccoli timbs
Niggaz, come in the game, block they shot at the rim
That ain't in you? The fuck you gon' possibly win?
I do it, 'Booty calls' on the Blackstreet Teddy tip
Keep a steady grip, make cream just like ready whip
Heavy with styles that's the deadliest
Cats on that petty shit, watch how much lead he get
You tryin' to go places, chasin' oasis
About nothin', gettin' low wages
Drink Hennessey with no chasers
Right hook is like Joe Frasier's, I'm the bodacious
Body parts are big an' like Schwarz-a-niggaz
Smokin' Garcia Vega, tryin' to get the larger paper
If you block the cash, we lockin' ass
I'ma put it in your chest like a stalkin' past
Only out to earn figures like we please
But I don't mind to burn niggaz like CDs
Now, exhibit styles I kick with it
Pardon me, but I'm fuckin' sick widdit
Aiyyo, gats we bust, backs we crush
Only hot tracks we lust an' crazy stacks we clutch
An' we need plaques to touch that say platinum plus
'Cause half of you niggaz that's rappin' now is whack to us
Aiyyo, gats we bust, backs we crush
Only hot tracks we lust an' crazy stacks we clutch
An' we need plaques to touch that say platinum plus
'Cause half of you niggaz that's rappin' now is whack to us
