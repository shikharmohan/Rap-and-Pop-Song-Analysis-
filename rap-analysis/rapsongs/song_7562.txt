Let's get it started
Oh, this that shit right here, nigga
Wassup? Yeah, wassup? Nigga, 103, yeah
When this hit drop in the club, nigga
Yeah, yeah, let go, let go
Why y'all trippin'? I'm just fine
12:45, 'bout that time
Couldn't get it all week, time to unwind
Drankin' like a tank, lose my mind
This shit crazy, way too packed
RosÃÂ© baby, waste two stacks
Hardest thing in the lot that there mine
Can't spell sober, lost my mind
I'm hearing voices in my head, think I'm schizophrenic
Swear they sayin' they get it from another planet
36, a thousand times do a somersault
Do it right and you can live your whole summer raw
I'm out my mind, yeah, a nigga seein' double y'all
Tell me what's the chance of Jizzle fuckin' both of y'all
She said as long as we can do it with your ice on
If that's the case I might as well leave the lights on
I'm out my mind, just blew a thousand Swisher Sweets
In my black and orange Charger, call it trick or treat
It ain't nothin' to a boss, my goons got goons
House stupid dumb big, my rooms got rooms
Why y'all trippin'? I'm just fine
12:45, 'bout that time
Couldn't get it all week, time to unwind
Drankin' like a tank, lose my mind
This shit crazy, way too packed
RosÃÂ© baby, waste two stacks
Hardest thing in the lot that there mine
Can't spell sober, lost my mind
Guess what my mama told me, she hate my partner
Guess why she hate her though? 'Cause our love wrong
Fuck da police 'cause our love prowlin'
White girls fun 'cause all of them swallow
Why I ain't fuck her at da house? 'Cause the bitch holla
And where the pill man at? He need a blue dolphin
Old broke ass nigga stop cock blockin'
Security, I need help 'cause the bitch stalkin'
A half fuckin' mil, that's what the whip cost me
100 dollas, that's what the pussy cost me
And when the nigga start hatin' that's when the nigga lost me
Fantastico, that's what the ho's call me
Why y'all trippin'? I'm just fine
12:45, 'bout that time
Couldn't get it all week, time to unwind
Drankin' like a tank, lose my mind
This shit crazy, way too packed
RosÃÂ© baby, waste two stacks
Hardest thang in the lot that there mine
Can't spell sober, lost my mind
Drop the top, no bra, got the titties out
Mention my name and bring the whole city out
Doin' what I do best, D-boy stuntin'
New car, old money D-boy stuntin'
Stepped in, cleaner than a new Glock 40
My nickname in the A is strapped-up shorty
You know my nerve there trigger like a toothpick
Line wrapped around the corner boy, too thick
G coat, black shades and my black chains
And if you wouldn't understand it's a black thing
You know we drink that rosÃÂ© until we blackout
Wake up, drink some more and pass back out
Why y'all trippin'? I'm just fine
12:45, 'bout that time
Couldn't get it all week, time to unwind
Drankin' like a tank, lose my mind
This shit crazy, way too packed
RosÃÂ© baby, waste two stacks
Hardest thang in the lot that there mine
Can't spell sober, lost my mind
Wassup? 103 yeah, yeah
Nigga, 103, yeah, yeah
Nigga, 103, yeah, yeah
Let go, let go
