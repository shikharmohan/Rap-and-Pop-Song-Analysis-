[Dr Dre]
The long-awaited Detox, trick
ÃÂ¢€ÃCause maybe I donÃÂ¢€t wanna stop, maybe I donÃÂ¢€t wanna quit
Maybe I like hoes, maybe I donÃÂ¢€t want a wife, maybe IÃÂ¢€m psycho
Maybe IÃÂ¢€m crazy, maybe IÃÂ¢€m strapped right now, just maybe
Maybe itÃÂ¢€s a relapse, maybe IÃÂ¢€m high right now, where the weed at?
Maybe this is ER, maybe IÃÂ¢€m a real doc and this is CPR
Maybe we need to breathe some life in this shit
Maybe we are the life of this shit
[?] Maybe IÃÂ¢€m just crazy (Crazy)
What they say? (What they say?)
Sak pase (Sak passe)
Nap boulÃÃÂ© (nap boulÃÃÂ©)

Dre, I think I need my sponsor
IÃÂ¢€m just outta contro-o-ol
Maybe I got hoes, every little city I go, like Paco
We tryna grow, but I just canÃÂ¢€t seen her
IÃÂ¢€m havinÃÂ¢€ trouble cleaninÃÂ¢€ up, IÃÂ¢€m like FEMA
All these little haters got me back with the nina
Got me bringinÃÂ¢€ guns to work, Gilbert Arenas
Unh, I donÃÂ¢€t know if itÃÂ¢€s the Goose talkinÃÂ¢€
But you know they say the liquor get your truth talkinÃÂ¢€
Maybe I should be somewhere in the group talkinÃÂ¢€
IÃÂ¢€m addicted to coupes and takinÃÂ¢€ roofs off ÃÂ¢€Ãem
IÃÂ¢€m addicted to watches, Heckler and Koches
Them bow-legged girls from the projects
ItÃÂ¢€s Bed-Stuy in this bitch (Bed-Stuy!)
Dre, whatÃÂ¢€s up? (ItÃÂ¢€s Westside over here)
IÃÂ¢€m in this party, IÃÂ¢€m up to no good
And I should be duckinÃÂ¢€ these clubs, Tiger Woods
[Dr. Dre]
I smoke (I smoke)
I drink (I drink)
IÃÂ¢€m supposed to stop, but I canÃÂ¢€t
Nigga, donÃÂ¢€t ask why (Ask why)
I get high (I get high)
IÃÂ¢€m just livinÃÂ¢€ my moÃÂ¢€fuckinÃÂ¢€ life
So what? IÃÂ¢€m drunk (IÃÂ¢€m drunk)
And IÃÂ¢€m a weedhead (Weedhead)
And IÃÂ¢€ma treat every day like the weekend
Headfirst off the deep end
Yeah, you know whatÃÂ¢€s happeninÃÂ¢€
IÃÂ¢€m just relapsinÃÂ¢€
