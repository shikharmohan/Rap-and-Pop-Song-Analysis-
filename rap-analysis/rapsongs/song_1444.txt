{Look man! You're botherin' me G
I got shit to do right now, aight?
This is for De La Soul, you know what I'm sayin'?
Word up I got shit to do you test tube baby}
Check one two, check one two
De La Soul, is now back on the map
Long Island, is now back on the map
Good rap music, is now back on the map
Yo check one two, this is the voice of yours truly the Flava Flav
And I just want y'all to know, we ain't goin' nowhere
Old school is here to stay boy
On the outskirts, of what works
Live those who go for broke, and merk to get merked
Live by the sword and die by the semi
Not part of my ways, but stays right in my
N Y mentality for me, to be the best
The current, the ones who weren't
Pressed, to confess lies over hot joints
To sell to all who wanna hear some
(Young Guns these days got fireproof eardrums)
They don't give a shit who's hot
Just long as you're not, pussy and be the would-be king
But once crowned, the same wanna pull you down
(And what makes the world go 'round)
And I be the world renowned wonder why
Wonderin' why you can't stand me?
Is it because I'm the main Jackson?
And y'all just Titos and Randys? Yes it is
Bless the kid who hold his own head and expect to last
At the same time, I want respect and cash
And a few paragraphs in them books
Tellin' you how us native tongues made hits with no hooks
Rapped in every prefixes, gave birth to rap remixes back in '88
No disrespect to Diddy, just settin' it straight
Instead of zig-zaggin', got a degree in raggin'
My daughter says I'm a teen, 'cause like a teen
My pants always saggin' and I walk with a bop
The sex part of my time, I walked from my pop
No longer on timey and was never on loud
But cooked rhymes that make the chefs of Wu proud
I'm top cloud to rain on your show
And still anything goes when it comes to hoes because

Make you shake like, sunshine, naked shoe was once mine
Had bottom inner drawers and used to hit it from the mids
Fix your playground player or
Some kids'll come stomp in your sandbox
Swollen hands cocked back
No knives, no drama, no guns
No disrespectin' your seed of Ma Dukes
I puke rhyme and you laugh, take a sniff
Of these fricaseed raps on Carribean riffs
See last night's change was today's doe money
No time for your freestyles so roll money
No more whack albums with two joints
No more ballplayin' rappers who shoot ya two points
(No more G, 'cause I'm sick of your hip-hop!)
Your flows bore like seashores with no bitches
Switchhittin' niggaz will receive no pitches
No diamonds on the field, just keep the game real
Simple, see the God flows healthy
Wealth in the mind is like money in the bank
Exchange cash like thoughts in conversation
Thank you for your purchases, we doe out
And roll out the Kool-Aid, come and crop to see us pimp strut
Ain't really pimpin', I'm tryin' to catch the bus
The Krush Groove ain't got shit on Cold Crush
We dolly dolly babies 'cause we shootin' cats
'Back to the future' rap with Doc Brown shotgunnin' it
And pantyhose your whole style and start runnin' it
You dudes fiddle while we stay on the cello
The mush in your room son, we stay portobello
Can't settle for the same picket white fence
I got dreams of barbed wire in front of factories pa
Still push the truck with the factories pa
I'm bound to wreck the whip and turn insurance out, make 'em shout

Yeah that's right! Flava Flav, with De La Soul
Act bold, and we knock you straight up in the hole
You know what I'm sayin' six feet deep
That's the way that we keep, rollin'
You know what I'm sayin' operation tech sensation in the nation
Ready to take it to Penn station, you know what I'm sayin'
Yeah, ah ha ha ha
Long Island one is, that's where we is man
De la soul, you done it again
De la soul, you done it again
De la soul, you done it again
Flava Flav, de la soul, you done it again
{Persue my strategy , when it comes down to my work ethic
I mean it's simple, just be the best, you know what I'm sayin'?
To be the best, the first, the only one in the game
That's is gonna do it for years and years man
It's like, you know, how you gonna say
That I went out at the top of the game?
The top of the game niggas, is the one that's producing
Through out their career}
