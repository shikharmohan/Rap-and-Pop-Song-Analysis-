Yeah, ladies and gentlemen
I'll like to thank you all for coming out tonight
It's my third album, third tour, third time's a charm
Girl when I go, I wanna take you 'round the globe with me
I got doe, kinda paper you can blow with me
And baby, I know that money ain't everything
But it's for sure and ain't for nothing when you fuck with me
When I go
Follow my lead, baby, I could be all you need
If you follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'll hold you down, put your trust in me
Baby follow my lead
Follow my lead, I think God made you for me
Follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'm the one girl in time you'll see
If you follow my lead
Don't listen to the rumors, they say 50 fuckin' crazy
50 don't know how to treat a lady
They wrong, I like you a lot, I don't wanna hurt you
But I call a square a square and a circle a circle
So if you act like a bitch, I call you a bitch
Then hang up, probably call you right back and shit
And I have to say, baby, I apologize
Cross my fingers, God forgive me for tellin' lies
Like Janet Jackson said, "I miss you much"
I really wanna feel your touch and smell your scent
Baby, I could pass the day watchin' you model lingerie
I wanna spend the night tonight, shorty, if its' okay
You can be my Beyonce, I'll be your Jay
I gotta great sense of humor
First I'll make ya smile then I whoo ya
You know I wanna do you or do you?
Follow my lead, baby, I could be all you need
If you follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'll hold you down, put your trust in me
Baby follow my lead
Follow my lead, I think God made you for me
Follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'm the one girl in time you'll see
If you follow my lead
After seven hours, New York to London
You wonderin' what's gonna be the next stop
I told you, I'ma don, you gonna know I'ma don
After you shop, till your feet hurt in Milan
Now take a picture, these are moments you can cherish
They say the scenery was made for lovers out in Paris
Ask a fan about me they say, 50, we love 'em
Without them there's no me so I love them
Man, they are the reason I exist, the reason I insist
I'm never less then the best, I'm perfection I guess
That's why niggas are stressed, I'll pass the test
Every time I drop, I'm burnin' hot
So I don't care if she loves me or loves me not
Long as I enjoy the time that we spend
I ain't lookin' for commitment, we could fuck and be friends
Matter of fact we can do it right in back in my Benz
I get it done with speed
Follow my lead, baby, I could be all you need
If you follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'll hold you down, put your trust in me
Baby follow my lead
Follow my lead, I think God made you for me
Follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'm the one girl in time you'll see
If you follow my lead
Follow, follow my lead
Follow my lead
Follow my lead
Follow my lead
Follow my lead
