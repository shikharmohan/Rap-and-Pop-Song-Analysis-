Ay 40 mayne, I seen one of yo' hoes
Last night mayne, she was just uhh
(Hmm)
She was tryin' to give that ass
Away for free mayne, whatchu gon' do?
(Aight, I'ma tell you like this)
It's like dis, just point out the target
And I'll bet some cash I can't miss
This nigga done started 'cause I got some ass
From his bitch, more broken than hearted
Fool on the hill over this but I'm just as retarded
I act a fool up in this bitch, the reason why she departed
'Cause she was tired of gettin dissed
Dotted and darted all in her eyes like this
But that ain't my business, I keep my game universal
And leave that ol' [unverified] around shit up to them
Squares like Urkel, it's too many lobsters up in the ocean
Big pimps but not enough mobsters breakin' them in
Big pimps tellin' forty, done taught us how to begin
Pull a bitch off the streets and reel her in
To my sable, but everybody ain't able
Now she's a call girl, dancin' on the table
Sound like somethin' Iceberg Slim woulda said
(Tell me)
The bigger the pimp
(The bigger)
The longer the bread
(The longer)
Keep pimpin'
(Forty-water)
Keep pimpin'
Keep pimpin, keep pimpin'
(The bigger the pimp, the longer the bread)
Keep pimpin'
(Forty-water)
keep pimpin'
(Yes, your honor)
Keep pimpin', keep pimpin'
(The bigger the pimp, the longer the bread)
She looked at her reflection in the mirror
(In the mirror)
Told herself, from this day
Here ain't NAR a nigga pumpin' fear
Took all I can, but I can't take no mo', enough
Yesternight I got my ass slapped up, kinda tough
Got me lookin' like a rainbow
(A rainbow)
Black eyes, aches and pains, bruises purple and yellow
But I forgive and forget 'cause it's all gravy
(That's right)
I used to fuck for free but now I'm gettin' money lately
Big-ass dookie mayne, big-ass breasts
But the bitch got more miles on her, than SouthWest
You can have that hoe, mayne, but, nigga, please
Is that any kind of broad you want to make yo' main squeeze?
The mental, be timin' and thinkin' hairy
All kind of cracks and crevice
Makin' cranny, man, the bitch don't even wear no panties
Sound like somethin' Dolemite woulda said
The bigger the pimpin', the longer the bread, beotch
Keep pimpin'
(forty-water)
Keep pimpin'
Keep pimpin, keep pimpin'
(The bigger the pimp, the longer the bread)
Keep pimpin'
(forty-water)
keep pimpin'
(Yes, your honor)
Keep pimpin', keep pimpin'
(The bigger the pimp, the longer the bread)
I take seven switch-a-bitches put 'em in a line
Put 'em on the hoe stroll and make 'em work for mine
Take a mud duck, turn her into gold
Make her sell her ass up in the North Pole
From Lebanon, to Yugoslavia, from Petersberg, to Nova Scotia
I got niggaz in 'Sace suits, trickin' big
Timers in 'gator boots, givin' in justice, corporate executives
Athletes, 'cause they respect a bitch, man you'd be surprised
How many niggaz love to pay for pussy
Niggaz cheat on they wives and jack up
All they fuckin' money, man
I be givin' my hoes, bonuses and benefits
Boat cruises and Kamal outfits
Latex to keep their health a good
Checkups at planned parenthood
(That's it)
Best run witcha pimp, yes your honor
Practice your profession keep your head above water
Sound like somethin' Felix Mitchell woulda said
The bigger the pimpin', the longer the bread, beotch
Keep pimpin'
(forty-water)
Keep pimpin'
Keep pimpin, keep pimpin'
(The bigger the pimp, the longer the bread)
Keep pimpin'
(forty-water)
keep pimpin'
(Yes, your honor)
Keep pimpin', keep pimpin'
(The bigger the pimp, the longer the bread)
Beotch, c'mon
Do do dooo, do do dooo
Do do dooo do, do do dooo
(Pimp)
Anything
(That's right)
That you want me to, beotch
Anything, that you want me to do
(The bigger the pimp, the longer the bread)
Anything yeah, that you want me to
I'll do it
