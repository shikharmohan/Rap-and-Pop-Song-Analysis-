The name of the game is
Persistence, dedication
Consistent, motivation, resistance to stagnation to information
Distribute it free to the entire population
No hesitation, makin' it public, no privatization from corporations
Today, in order to be sane
You gotta go crazy so remain on top of the game
And master your universe like you was He-Man
See me and Hi Tek knock you out de frame while I'm stimulatin' de brain
In de 'Train Of Thought', that's the name of the Reflection Eternal LP man
Ain't nuttin' new except organic produce, that means that's free range
You might see me on MTV, BET or still up on the D-train
It's just everybody else be seemin' strange in they approach
I see these guys and read they eyes, need to disguise and so I cloak
Into a cloud of smoke
I brown a roach to keep myself from soundin' loc'
Destroy they hopes of hatin', don't move aboard
Before they rock the boat
Yo, it's not the dope
These snakes will come in peace to slit your throat
Give you compliments, with a promise yet
To get me heated and provoke me
To be rockin' shit, shove apocalypse down your esophagus
So, swallow that
Guess what you could be coppin' that N'kiru Books
For fifteen dollars, flat
Cats who spit knowledge on tracks
And get bumped out the back of Impalas
And Cadillacs all my live Cincinatti Bearcats, holla back
Tomorrow they gonna wanna borrow raps like
"C'mon black, I'll pay you back"
I ain't no lyrical ATM even though I'm nice and I'm a mack
Better believe that, leave that crack alone
And you see that there microphone
Ain't no place to work your self-esteem issues
Do that shit when you alone
Nigga, you is grown, why is you still suckin' on that pacifier?
Quickly call that ass a liar, exposin' you's my last desire
Olympic skills so pass the fire, I roll with niggaz that match attire
Black aware, that's filled with gas but rollin' on flat ass tires
Yo, with that, yo, yo, you know what? Yo, yo
Yo, I got a special guest, lil' Baby Tone, Tone, tell 'em what's up
What's up? [Incomprehensible]
True
Yo, we 'bout to be out, tell 'em peace out, Tone
Peace out, yeah, what, what, Baby Tone, what?
What?
