Nigga, get ready for the big payback
Been thuggin' and keepin' the gully since way back
Lot a niggas been talkin', they runnin' they mouths barkin'
Runnin' around false, they claimin' they want a weapon to rob us
My record is flawless, my method is lawless
I'm an automatic weapon, nigga, you just a target
The number one artist from the land of the heartless
Fittin' to get cha, hit cha nigga, they couldn't call it
One nigga left and they talkin' about we ain't happenin'
So we had to give that up and make 'em recognize platinum
Look at everybody rappin' just like I'm rappin'
Niggas, got to admit it the Bone Thug is the masta
They die and there's no competition, no competition
Tear the roof off the mothafucka
I put a boot off in a mothafuckas ass
Still down to blast or clash with anyone of you niggas
Who start we ain't trippin' off of none of you niggas
Leatherface, the boy is back with a little bit of action
Bring it, rap it, sing it, bust it
Whateva dog, whateva y'all want to do I'm with it
Wicked
Go loco with the heata, 9mm

I done had a mil, took a mil, blew a mil
Still in the streets, that's how I live, I live
It don't mean a damn thing
Still got a little change, believe me comin' in
Shit, I pass a nigga, seen a lot of niggas
Call him out, point him out, that's him here
It about to be E with a big cast, eat him up
Send him on his way, kick him in his ass, have a nice day
Went the wrong way, got a lot to say
It can get so murderous, murderous
Touchin' us never that Bone Thug still the crack
Crack and I can't lay back on the comeback
Spit on these niggas, spit on these niggas
Run up any you niggas, any you niggas
Won' be no recognizin' niggas
Just one warning impatient one time only, okay
Don't repeat myself bad for my health
Don't want to do that, rather spray
Catch me on the wrong day, catch me on the wrong day
Better stay out my way, better stay out my face
That's the last thing you wanna do, Thugs true
See the blues I shoot at you, now you boo
Go loco with the heata, 9mm
9mm, millimeter, millimeter, pop, pop
Go loco with the heata, 9mm
9mm, millimeter, millimeter, pop, pop
Go loco with the heata, 9mm

Y'all know how I feel about fake niggas
Bitch niggas, snitch niggas, ain't no love for them
Put a nigga in his place, momma cryin' at the wake
That's right that's what a nigga does for them
I play above the rim
With no lames in my circle 'cause I love to win
With the real ass niggas with the thug in them
And if you talk too much, I put a slug in them
Oh no, don't play with 'em, Lay gon' get 'em
If Wish don't get 'em then Kray gon' get 'em
Straight up we spit 'em with a nine on my side
And I slide to the rhythm
Let me slow it down in case you didn't catch my drift
Lift a nigga up out his shoes, trigga finga not hesitant, fuck it
Let me speed it up, hit 'em like the ammunition
Comin' from my heata, y'all niggas can't see these thugs
17 shots from the 9mm
On the creep with the night vision
Infrared beams pointed at your dome
Can't wait to see a niggas response
When I rip that vest with the Teflon, Teflon
Go loco with the heata 9mm
9mm, millimeter, millimeter, pop, pop
Go loco with the heata, 9mm
9mm, millimeter, millimeter, pop, pop
Go loco with the heata, 9mm
9mm, millimeter millimeter, pop, pop
Go loco with the heata, 9mm
9mm, millimeter, millimeter, pop, pop
