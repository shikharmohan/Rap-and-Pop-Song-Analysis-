Heavenly Father, creator of all things
I humble myself as I bow to your throne
I pray for love, joy, peace and happiness
I pray for love, I pray for love
I pray for love, joy, peace and happiness
I pray for love, I pray for love
I pray for love, joy, peace and happiness
They say the closest ones to you
Be the ones that sneak up behind you and stick the knife through you
That's why now I keep my friends to a minimum
Check for the ones with the venom on they tongue
'Cuz niggas is snakes, they hugs be fake
Steal from they best friend at his own wake
I did all I can do and I took all I can take
This is it, crossin' me was ya biggest mistake
And was it enough that I split 20% of what I make?
Was it enough that I cut niggas half of what I bake?
Ain't enough that I almost lost all my bread
Bailin' niggas out, keepin' a roof over our head
Enough is enough, I wash my hands, I'm done wit it
I ain't playin' wit you motherfuckers come with it
Keep the fam together God knows I tried
But shit ain't been the same since B.I. died
I pray for love, I pray for love
I pray for love, joy, peace and happiness
I pray for love, I pray for love
I pray for love, joy
Act like I ain't the Lee, Chanel, Versace and Louis
Please, I'm the reason this rap game is unisex
I'm the reason bitches want bigger breasts
Show some respect where respect is due
Without me there'd be no you
These next few lines is to you women abusers
Last nigga I was with, straight fuckin' loser
Niggas think 'cuz you give 'em ya heart
They can dissect it and rip it apart
Not I, one nigga's in my eye
Payback's a motherfucker, put that on the sty
You lost a good bitch nigga you can't front
Lil' Kim is everything a man could ever want and that's real
I pray for love, I pray for love
I pray for love, joy, peace and happiness
I pray for love, I pray for love
I pray for love, joy, peace and happiness
When the money is gone
When the gas runs out
They just don't make my breed no more
Nobody lives by the code of the street no more
I don't deal wit the nonsense, I'm keepin' it real
Wanna do business wit me? Get in touch with Him
That's right any questions? No you can't ask me
Put your name and your number on a letterhead and fax me
You want Kim? Name the location
75 grand and that's just for conversation
I'ma remain loyal while y'all crumble like the foil
It's tradition to rock diamonds in my crown, I'm royal
Niggas ain't believe in me, they thought it was over
Baby girl risin' up like the early mornin' sun
You'll think your know but you'll have no idea
What the fuck I been goin' through these last 7 years
I pray for love, I pray for love
I pray for love, joy, peace and happiness
I pray for love, I pray for love
I pray for love, joy, peace and happiness
Well I'm sayin' I just wanna be happy
That's all I don't ask for much
It makes me happy to see my people smile
You know what I'm sayin'?
I ain't a hater, I don't even like sayin' the word
I'd sacrifice everything I got right now
To have my man Biggie here wit me
You see that's just how I am 'cuz I'm a rider
What good is it to have everything
If you can't share it with the one you love?
If you can't be with the ones you love then love the ones you wit
Don't take nobody for granted, you ain't promised tomorrow
Karma's a motherfucker, I'm appreciative
