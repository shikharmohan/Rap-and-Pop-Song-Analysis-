Thanks to mart666@xxl.ee for these lyrics. [Intro]  Yo Ice - We heard what happened man  We heard some niggas ran in on you man Yeah yeah, shit was fucked up man, it was real fucked up Don't worry - We know who did it  What're you talkin about man?  The shit just happened like 3 hours ago Yeah - but we know who did it man... it was your boy What? Naugh man I'm not trying to hear that I can't believe this shit man, I grew up with this nigga man Yo listen man, it was your boy man - He talks a lot  And this nigga set me up? This motherfucker, I would've died for this nigga man You're now fucking with your last nigga  Quick to blast nigga   Gauge Masturbator  Chest Plate disintegrator, rider  I never wore no mask, wacked the witness - vestless  I'll put you on the graveyard's guest list ICE - cause I lack all emotions, I'm heartless  That's why I can't figure for the life of me  You'd want to start this  My crew is bottomless Street Lobotomists  Gun slingers  Glock cocked and diamond ringers  My nigga got shot but still alive Hustlers  He took a full clip from another player's 25  I told him, stay home, rest up, I got enough gunning  And he said he's rolling with me, if you're coming Homiciders  Blood letters Money getters  Ballin' rag Rolls riders  The last thing I heard you say you said I was a dead man, bitch  Life betters I'll put you right into gun point, you snitch  Now I know your plans are rolling on me, late when I sleep Why don't we do this man to man? Let them bitch niggas creep I still remember in the days when we was friends chillin Now it seems you going to have to be my next killin  Chorus: You wanna go to war, nigga tell me why?  Punk niggas talk shit, bitch niggas die  Let's take it to the streets and I'm a check your heart I never backed down and it ain't no time to start   You must be death wishing, what's up? You know my steelo  Got love with the illest of blacks and amigos Your jealousy is outta hand, I can't fuck wit'cha And all your so-called down niggas, say good luck to ya  They know you're off the hook and you're soon to bleed  My reputation states that I kills with speed  More drama than a rap verse  You'll feel the mack first  In your back first  Then the black hearse Goddamn, I can't understand the drama why?  Now you're talking that shit like a bitch on the rag  To tell the fucking truth I thought your crew was fly  I drop a hot one in your forehead, neck and mouth  Don't give a fuck about your set or the pants you sag  Then rush a hospital and bank ya if you don't check out  A cold blooded motherfucker, that's why they call me ICE  Cause I'm a mad nigga once, a crazy nigga twice  I would said never - no, we down forever - we flipped keys together  Now the street talkers say you want my spot  And if you told me this would happen A lotta niggas did, A lotta niggas shot  Chorus  It's obvious some sucka niggas got ya gassed Let's see if they around you when the gunshots blast  It ain't nothing nice, letting off slugs under the street life  Early deaths, dry gags and last breaths How to fuck with the king, when you're a bullshit pawn?  I seen your time before you want - war till it's on  I can't comprehend your stupidity, miscalculation  Word to obstetricians show your crews anhiliation  Predicted, Brains get evicted, Fuckin with me kid Bullets lift your lid And watch your weak kool aid heart run down the drain  I got the Method Man who came to bring the pain Let you know quick, niggas suck dick if you trip  Frustration leads to aggravation and dismay  Used to be my homie, now you just a punk ho bitch  Now you're player haten, but that's the wrong game to play  I light your block up, kidnap your moms - snatch your woman  You beg for me to stop, but I'll just keep coming You're fucking with the illest fool in Southern California  I can roll with ya, or motherfuckin' on ya  Chorus Yeah, I know the real nigga can feel this.   This is dedicated to all my "friends"
