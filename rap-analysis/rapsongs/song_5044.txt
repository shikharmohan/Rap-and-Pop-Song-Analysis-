I told you I would show up screamin' out FNF
'Til the world blow up, they said I was so finished
I told 'em it's show business
Meanin' there's no business, as Fiasco's in it
Disrespect the dress code
Wear my street clothes in it
Measured, sold and clothed in it
Opened up closed, after I entered and drove in it like uh
Only fear God
Know the weapons of the weak
The weakness of the heart
And never fall asleep
Roll in it, music bumpin', windows tinted
Through they good neighborhoods
And all of the wolves in it
Exerted control in it
Seen it come and go, stolen and sold in it
Diamond and gold plated
Fountain of youth, dippin' my toes in it
Bounce in the booth, spit it like skull in it
Putting my heart and my soul in it
'Cause I only fear God
Know the weapons of the weak
The weakness of the heart
And never fall asleep
Once upon a time, not long ago
When the pusher man creep, where they live life po'
With fifteen in the clip and one in the hole
Hallway wall full of bricks, only some of us know
None of us know the makers of the toast
Like the bottom of the stove
That was used in the murderin' of the scroll
Heart colder than E.D.s
Won't let the CD's city defeat me
Rub me out like genies
Smoke a sweet to my graffiti, nigga, what?
I only fear God
Know the weapons of the weak
The weakness of the heart
And I will never sleep
Marvin Billups said wat up to the Reaper
Held meth like Riddell and high water, hello
To the five year old gunshot hero, I hear ya
Clearer than the invisible man in the mirror
Cheer up, I put it on the bars like beer nuts
Put a bug in they ear, so from here up, they hear us
Then we only fear God
Know the weapons of the weak
The weakness of the heart
And we will never sleep
Once upon a time, not long ago
When the pusher man creep, where they live life po'
I put it on my grandmomma's daughter
A microphone control of the soul of slave
Hummin' 'Wadin' in the Water'
I author like D.W., brother like a hustla
God, place me in Your armor, I prescribe no partnas
I do it for the hood like a parka
And tell my niggaz not to shiver
Only time we quiver like a archer is
'Cause we only fear God
Know the weapons of the weak
The weakness of the heart
And we will never sleep
Here we are now, entertain us
Change, don't change us
Ever since the game trained us
We came up like worms in the rain
I dream my chain became a loose noose
That was used to hang us
So now, my insane brain, my 32 teeth
And two feet creep like it's Elm Street
'Cause I only fear God
Know the weapons of the weak
The weakness of the heart
And and now I will never asleep
Once upon a time, not long ago
When the pusher man creep, where they live life po'
