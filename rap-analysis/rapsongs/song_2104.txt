It's 1993 and niggas need to miss me be savin' these hoes
You know how these tricks we be buyin' 'em clothes
Wanna taxi hoes on vogues with the beat
And have 'em sittin' next to 'em in the front seat
But not B see I'm a hog up out the V
And my motto is fuck a hoe and hit the throttle
To the smoke talkin' on my Okie doe
World wide I got a clydes up in Tokyo
Look up in the sky it's a bird it's a plane
What's that niggas name? Captain save a hoe main
More faster than a speeding bullet to put on his cape and scared
I put the fake the fake the funk the funk
To me that's not the way to do it
Captain muthafuckin' save a hoe game to me
Flexin' just like a little ol' bitch all up in front of my company
Had to check his ass with an ear check dump and pumpin'
Talkin' to him while I'm beatin' his ass
Pumpin' fear talkin' 'bout nigga you gone retrospect somethin' here
Ah is a, ah is a, should I save her?
I want to be saved
Ah is a, ah is a, should I save her?
I want to be saved
Ah is a, ah is a, should I save her?

The other day you see me smobbin' down magazine
With some ol' nigga in your car lookin' at me mean
I stopped in the middle of the street reached under seat to grab my heat
Man that's the same motherfucker
That I got into it with at the club last week
Man them niggas can't fade they birth made and so they start
But niggas with no heart don't want no part to this
Nigga rollin' with the Funk Mobb
And when it's funk the pump will spit them double laws
So what you doin' when we roll through you hideout
Let my mack get off and then I rides out
With your ass there smokin' like an in cent
You savin' hoes nigga and that's bitch shit
Ah is a, ah is a, should I save her?

Captain save a hoe I ain't got no problem with that ol' shit
I gives a damn as long as he's payin'
It ain't my fault because he's sprung off my land
I'm cashin' G A checks, go to the bank Hank
If your breath stank, you get ganked main
Long as a trick comes fallin' down
That gets me all upset to put on my suit and clown
But make that nigga take care your kids
