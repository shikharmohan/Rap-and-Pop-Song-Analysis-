Shit, nigga, it's the niggas night out tonight, nigga
Keep hitting that reefer, sending me straight to heaven
Keep rolling, smoking and choking
Buddah lovaz
Gotta learn to smoke the buddah
I'm so glad you showed me, Krayzie, Layzie, Wish, Flesh
Reefer really makes me happy
Hydro, me just can't let a me high go
Me smoking upon that hydro
Me just can't let a me high go
Smo-smo-smoking that hydro
Won't, won't let a me high go
Water the reefer, me slaughter
Straight to Ziwiski to get me a sack
A sack, a sack, a sack
It grew in the water, the reefer, me slaughter
Straight to Ziwiski to get me a sack, a sack, a sack
It grew in the water
Straight to Ziwiski to get me a sack, a sack, sack
I'm taking a hit of the bud, gotta give love to my thugs
Smoking, not choking, now what?
I'm fucked up
That hydro really got me buzzed, me buzzed
Keep rolling and choking
(Smoking)
Nothing but the Bone in me
Me putting me casing up into me trunk
Box of blunts, come get drunk
Me putting me casing up into me trunk
Sack of skunk, come get drunk
It's sneaking upon me, wine
Follow me down the nine-nine
And you will find all of me kind every time
Drinking me wine, double your crime
When a me roll down the nine-nine
A stream of bullets and unload
With a me right way down your
Buddah
Choke up with a me buddah
Smoke jump outta me buddah
Hitting that hydro, letting me school ya
Oh, that buddah in your lungs and up
That buddah fool ya
It's nothing but the Bone in me
Hey, keep hitting that reefer sending me straight to heaven
If ya got a bag of tweed, well, blaze it with me, fool
Thugging with me trues, swigging on brews
Steady be losing me balance
It's a Bone thang how a nigga like me smoke and maintain
Maintain, maintain
How a nigga like me smoke and maintain
Remain the same, number one
