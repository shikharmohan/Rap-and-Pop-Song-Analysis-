Attention, all you niggaz, all you bitches
Time to put down the cristal, time to take off the ice for a minute
Time to throw a little mud
Turn me up some, yo
Yo, yo, gimme some room, I'm throwin' elbows
Timberland boots, Air Force and shell-toes, who the fuck is them
If I gotta pay to get in the club
I'ma go pop the trunk and turn the street volume up to ten
I ain't on the guest list, I ain't V.I.P.
I snuck in the exit, learned to D-I-P
My dress code is all black when I'm makin' the moves
Similar to the new Play station 2
I can't help it if the club only packin' a G
And the fire marshal wanna shut it down in 3
And you ballin' ass niggaz whose dressed to kill
For the hoes showin' the toes with extra heels
I gotta get in, I drove here
With a carload of bitches charged on Belvedere
My niggaz hit the cells if the line is thick
So I drive the 500 through the door of the bitch
If you pumpin' this one in your truck
(Let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty
(Let's get dirty)
And you really don't give a, what?
(Let's get dirty)
Say, let's get dirty
(Let's get dirty)
Everybody get your hands up
(Let's get dirty)
Say, let's get dirty
(Let's get dirty)
If you ain't come to party, shut up
(Let's get dirty)
Say, let's get dirty
Yo, security pattin' my legs and waist
But if I vacate the place, it'll be "stay down"
All my niggaz in the huddle on the count of three
We gonna bum rush The Tunnel with a pound of weed
Cut the light on, you see it's Brick City in here
Blazin' like Biggie passed us a semi in here
Don't sleep, stay wide awoke
You dialed Doc, not dial-a-joke
Crawl or you'll die in smoke
I keep it heated when the hawk is out
Seated low Tahoe, beat it when the dark is out
I'm outside of the line and I'm actin' a fool
Like a three o'clock bully, waitin' after school
Punks, I've been in this line for hours
I even killed the time by helpin' my man pass out fliers
Now all I wanna do is get in where I fit in
Shake my ass with the baddest pigeon with her wig in
Jump, move, crash, drink
Shake that ass stank, the fuck you think?
Poppa Bear at the table and the porridge is pourin'
Since Def is the label, I belong in a morgue
I'm walkin' half-dead, actin' senile
With bigga niggaz from jail than the one on "Green Mile"
I'll huff and puff, blow the club down
I'll snuff a duck, I'm headed Uptown
Yeah, that's right! We up in this joint now
Aiyyo, we gettin' ready to take over
Freddie, you grab the mic, I'ma grab the turntables
We gon' rock this joint, baby
If you got up in the club free
(Let's get dirty)
Say, let's get dirty
(Let's get dirty)
And you drunk up in the V.I.P.
(Let's get dirty)
Say, let's get dirty
(Let's get dirty)
If you swingin' from them club lights
(Let's get dirty)
Say, let's get dirty
(Let's get dirty)
And you like to start them club fights
(Let's get dirty)
Say, let's get dirty
Everybody wave your hands now
(Let's get dirty)
Say, let's get dirty
(Let's get dirty)
Everybody jump up and down
(Let's get dirty)
Say, let's get dirty
(Let's get dirty)
Everybody keep it goin' now
(Let's get dirty)
Say, let's get dirty
(Let's get dirty)
Just a little bit louder now
(Let's get dirty)
Say, let's get dirty, c'mon, c'mon
Let's get dirty
(A-huh, a-huh, a-huh)
Let's get dirty
(Keep it goin' now)
Let's get dirty
(Don't stop, don't stop, man)
Let's get dirty
(Say, let's get dirty, yo)
Let's get dirty
(A-huh)
Let's get dirty
Let's get dirty
Let's get dirty
