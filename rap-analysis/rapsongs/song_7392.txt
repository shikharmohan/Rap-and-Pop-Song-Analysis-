Boys kickin' back, layin' in the shade
Ain't nobody trippin' 'cause the money already made
Boys kickin' back, layin' in the shade
Ain't nobody trippin' 'cause the money already made
Boys kickin' back, layin' in the shade
Ain't nobody trippin' 'cause the money already made
90s was for jackin', 2000 for the ballers
The drop top Jag or the candy red Impala
Sellin' big cheese, keep pushin', my nigga
Polo horses on my bed-fuck Hilfiga
I'm Pimp C bitch, in the ghetto, I'm a star
I made this for the niggas tryin' ta chop in they cars
I made this for the niggas tryin' ta chop in
I made this for the niggas tryin' ta chop in they cars
Could I, would I, should I break 'em?
Uh, I wanna chop blades
Could I, would I, should I break 'em?
Uh, I wanna chop blades
Could I, would I, should I break 'em?
Uh, I wanna chop blades
Could I, would I, should I break 'em?
Uh, I wanna chop blades
Now, when I turn my knock up, and bangin' yo' block up
Without pickin' my Glock up, I'm raisin' my stock up
I got haters on lock-up boy, they slangin' rock up
And bangin' Makaveli 7, crankin' my 'Pac up
Now, ain't no stoppin' when the tops start droppin'
Hearin' Fat Pat rappin', your hat back capin'
Now, ain't no stoppin' when the tops start droppin'
Hearin' Fat Pat rappin', your hat back capin'
Now, ain't no stoppin' when the tops start droppin'
Hearin' Fat Pat rappin', your hat back capin'
In a black 'Lac mackin' wit' a bop in a fade
Boy, we fat stack packin', steady choppin' on blades
Could I, would I, should I break 'em?
Uh, I wanna chop blades
Could I, would I, should I break 'em?
Uh, I wanna chop blades
Could I, would I, should I break 'em?
Uh, I wanna chop blades
Could I, would I, should I break 'em?
Uh, I wanna chop blades
It's time to hit the slab, Benz sittin' low
I'm puffin' on the 'dro, I got the pistol in the do'
I pulled up in my ride, these hoes lookin' hot
If she get up on my leatha, then her panties gon' drop
I just can't stop bleedin' my block
Got some prime cut cock, I mean some private ass stock
I just can't stop bleedin' my block
Got some prime cut cock, I mean some private ass stock
I just can't stop bleedin' my block
Got some prime cut cock, I mean some private ass stock
They put it in they mouth and never say,"No"
Some nut suckin' hoes, I mean some dick suckin' pros
That like to get exposed, and play with they nose
And bend they pussy over, for my nigga, and touch they toes
She do that shit for daddy, but them tricks gotta pay
Just like E 40  Pimpin' in a major way
It's all for the money, she tryin' ta stay paid
Steady breakin' niggas on them shiny ass thangs
It's all for the money, she tryin' ta stay paid
Steady breakin' niggas on them shiny ass thangs
It's all for the money, she tryin' ta stay paid
Steady breakin' niggas on them shiny ass thangs
I'm deep up in the street, I'm tryin' to fill my nuts
And later on I'ma try to skeet it on her butt
Could I, would I, should I break 'em?
Uh, I wanna chop blades
Could I, would I, should I break 'em?
Uh, I wanna chop blades
Could I, would I, should I break 'em?
Uh, I wanna chop blades
Could I, would I, should I break 'em?
Uh, I wanna chop blades
Say, nigga, I keeps my rims clean
Shiny thru a [Incomprehensible] scene
Got yo' bitch wetter than the captain of the swim team
Steppin' out the Caddy, bitch, I'm fresher than Dentyne
Slicker than Crisco, sweeter than Nabisco
From Philly to 'Frisco where the Don be a Sisqo
You better get some blades if you still ridin' this ho
Boys puttin' Swangers on Benzes, it gotta stop
If you fittin' ta ride foreign, then, nigga, you gotta chop
And Southern niggas still got the nerve to ride D's
I ain't hatin' on Daytons, but it's 2000, nigga please
It's all about the candy paint, it's all about the Vogues
It's all about the slab, baby, it's all about the hoes
Got some cars and some pros some real and some fraud
Hated on by a nigga, hated on by a broad
So long as J's sell, and them boppin' hoes slut
I'll be ridin' chromin' blades, steady choppin' hoes up
Could I, would I, should I break 'em?
Uh, I wanna chop blades
Could I, would I, should I break 'em?
Uh, I wanna chop blades
Could I, would I, should I break 'em?
Uh, I wanna chop blades
Could I, would I, should I break 'em?
Uh, I wanna chop blades
Yeah, dedicated to boys choppin' on chromin' thangs
Damn blades, know what I'm sayin'?
Boys choppin' in the [Incomprehensible]
Choppin' in that 4th
Choppin' in the 5th
