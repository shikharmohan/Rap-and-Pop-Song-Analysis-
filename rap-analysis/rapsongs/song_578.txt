New millennium, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony
It don't stop, it don't stop, it don't stop
The thugs is in the house
The thugs is in the house
The thugs is in the house
The thugs is in the house
Wanna see the thugs gone and wanna see the thugs gone
It don't stop while my thug music plays on
It won't stop, they wanna see the thugs gone
They wanna see the thugs gone
It won't stop, thug music plays on
I wanna holla, I need to talk to the world
The system haters, even though sometimes we tend to do right
Well look at the news, previews of all of our troubles in life
If it ain't one thing, its another they keep a composite of undercover
Really kind of disturbed us
They tryin' to make people think
That we bone thugs don't know what we do
We let 'em think that we playin' the heat
And celebratin' Eazy's victory, blowin' my week
And well it ain't that easy, being Krayzie Bone
Temptations battlin' and persuasion's rattlin' my brain
Won't go insane I'm thinkin' that's why they callin' me Krayzie
'Cause I still maintain
The thugs is in the house
We can't be stopped and we turn it out
The thugs is in the house
We can't be stopped and we turn it out
They probably thought that we would fall off
Be comin' up missing in this rap game
After 30 million records and 7 years, ain't nothin' changed
And everybody wanna be like The Bone
And you can put your radio on without you hearin' our flows
Ten toasts, to the earth, match for everyhting it's worth
'Til I'm dead and in the dirt, I'll be up there puttin' in work
Until it hurt, 'til it hurt, it be me and my niggas
Krayzie, Layzie, Bizzy, Wish, and Flesh, my niggas
We gon' ride for the niggas that didn't make it to see
The way we, do this here, Tomb Stone and Eazy E
While we ride, niggas is probably thinkin' we nutz
Like this mission gonna self-destruct
Come again, you got us fucked up
I'm a thug by nature, gettin' this paper be the reason
That these hustlers out of Cleveland
On the come up daily creepin'
Nigga believe me, we in the house
And every time I puts it down, we turns it out
The thugs is in the house
We can't be stopped, and we turn it out
The thugs is in the house
We can't be stopped, and we turn it out
You know and I know they thought it would take us nowhere
But look at 'em thugs now we on the top, we took it right there
Thugs got what you want, we came for the music
We can always pop that trunk, pump
Everywhere we go, and everywhere we be
Everybody recognize that B O N E, man
I ain't braggin' man, my life's a blessin'
Lord, please hear me now, don't take it away
Now I learned my lesson
You can stop the hatin', but that thugster music plays on
You can count on Bone to come and rock it till we dead gone
I know we spit that shit, and some don't like it
But Bone just keepin' it real wrong is wrong, right is right
The thugs is in the house
The thugs is in the house
The thugs is in the house
The thugs is in the house
And wanna see the thugs gone, and wanna see the thugs gone
It don't stop while my thug music plays on
It won't stop, they wanna see the thugs gone
They wanna see the thugs gone, it won't stop
Thug music plays on, it won't stop
The thugs is in the house
The thugs is in the house
The thugs is in the house
The thugs is in the house
