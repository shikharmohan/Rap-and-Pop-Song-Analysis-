Mob shit bitch
I know you know
But check game doe
I'm in the S-E 4-double-oh
Sitting real low, stick in the flo', oh
The hoe want me to come swoop
Take her for a ride in my blue Lex Luther
But the bitch ain't got no gas fetti
So I burnt her like fast Freddy
Hit me on the first when your mail has come
And maybe we can go to the mall or somethin'
Heavy ass shit for the mob
When I make a zillion I resign
I'm realer than a hundred dollar bill with the line across
When Christmas come around ask Santa Claus
Santa do you know E-40?
Bet you that nigga say, "That's my homey!"
We used to perv grind curb trip to my grandma
Kahlua with them brandy almost every day
Cardiac is cool, but I'm on gin
Santa bought me, a new mac-10
Yeah, click shit makes a motherfucker's night
Niggaz listen to it 'cuz it's light
Crooked twisted unlisted on the highways
We riding sideways, beotch
I'm riding sideways, this way thatta way
Back up the coupe and roll sideways
I'm riding sideways, this way thatta way
Made a left at the corner 'cuz it was hoes
I'm riding sideways, this way thatta way
I'm looking for a big seat
I'm riding sideways, this way thatta way
Hoes see this type of shit and go reala
I'm riding city to city me and leviti
So get your toilet paper 'cuz it's gon' get shitty
I hit the highway goin' east
Twenty-two ounces of yeast
I'm playin' this game 'cuz a nigga my age be
I met her last night and today she paged me
Wanna know if b-legit can kick it tonight
Only sixteen, way too tight
But age ain't nothin' but a number
Baby got her hair done by shanda
Nine nine ten, eleven and up
If you bleed, you get fucked
No not me, not fo'-oh
I break the bootch down with a two by fo'
Every fuckin' day is a holiday, celebration
When the bitch is actin' crabby
That means she's on her menestration
I be like fuckin' em like dissin' it to the highest
Talkin' more shit than kalidous
A str-uh, strizuck out in my cutlass supreme on a Friday
Which way we ridin'
Riding sideways, beotch
I'm riding sideways, this way thatta way
Doing about a buck fifty
I'm riding sideways, this way thatta way
Danked out and full of that cisco
I'm riding sideways, this way thatta way
Pervin' swervin' runnin' all into the curb
I'm riding sideways, this way thatta way
'Bout a gallon to the dome, then that's the hit
See I'ma hogg nigga, Beverly hill Billy
Neck bone, socks, tails, pork 'N' beans and chili
Just like my nigga Celly, we likes to kick it silly
Regurgitate and kick a bootch move up out the telly
'Cause they out there bad ain't satisfied
Hoes just wanna be pacified
But I can't do no justice 'cuz the justice ain't to be did
Bitch you usin' too much red
Now I've been known to break niggaz off
Hard type or soft, line 'em up chalk 'em up as a loss
See me in the parking lot doing my thang
Love to see my old school dance in the rain
The po-po's came then they closed up shop
Smashed through the hood and we made that hot
You see the shit don't stop, motherfuckers pop
Seven-deuce drop coney air shocks
Riding through the shit like racer x
And if a motherfucker flex break back and necks
Running red lights and the right-of-ways
How we gonna get it doe?
We get it sideways, bitch
I'm riding sideways, this way thatta way
Late at night up and down saying hi
I'm riding sideways, this way thatta way
Be trapped trunk, stark boulevard
I'm riding sideways, this way thatta way
Come here you little hard-ass boy
I'm riding sideways, this way thatta way
Niggaz like to hear this type of shit when they crawl
