The time has come
Ain't taking, nobody back with me
It's on till the end with anybody who want to hit me
Ain't looking back, putting it all on the line
Don't give a fuck, bring the rock one time
And I think we should all get down and busy
Say the four word and you spinning 'til you're dizzy
Niggas say who is he, but I'm the fore fact
Same fool that's watching, is the one who stabs your back
So, make a plot, but yo non-stop
Knowing exactly who comes on the block
Take no prisoners, put that in effect
Get the name for your set and tat it on your neck
Let these motherfuckers know who got next
Southside represent, are you catching wreck
And show your respect, when you step up to me son
Don't imitate, 'cuz my style, ain't in season
Go back to the lab, upgrade the chump
Get a new funk gun before you get dum dum
Meltdown, taking you home, the unknown
Countdown, hitting the ground, the seed's grown
Downtown, deep in the alley, the dark night
Gets lit up, when lightning strikes
Get up!
Meltdown, taking you home, the unknown
Countdown, hitting the ground, the seed's grown
Downtown, deep in the alley, the dark night
Gets lit up, when lightning strikes
Get up!
Take a bath
When lightning strikes, city lights are gleamin'
No sunshine, no California dreamin'
The Demon is roamin' on the loose, you got juice
Up for abuse, when electric currents are induced
So suck along, rock on, the brain waves
What you clocking, I'd be dropping the bomb, you get maimed
The games you play, look up and say you want to change
And rearrange, the strange, you never go the way
Don't look back, forget that, you need that
Just sit back, look at the show, and see that
Display the raw power, black out
Even the score, open the door, and break out
Leave it alone, the unknown fury, blind rage
Move aside, get wise and make the front page
Center stage, you at the top to lead with
Go suffer the pain, leave it alone, or be fixed
The heart beat, pumping your blood, high pressure
Look at you stuck in the mud, bring in the stretcher
Strapped down, ready to roll, the God knows
Tears coming down, the bucking, so pretty slow
Meltdown, taking you home, the unknown
Countdown, hitting the ground, the seed's grown
Downtown, hitting the alley, the dark night
Gets lit up, when lightning strikes
Get up!
Meltdown, taking you home, the unknown
Countdown, hitting the ground, the seed's grown
Downtown, hitting the alley, the dark night
Gets lit up, when lightning strikes
Get up!
