You might see me in the street
But Shorty you don't know me
When ya holla on the street
Rememba you don't know me
Save all the hatin and the poppin
Pimpin you don't know me
Quit tellin People you my partna
Listen you don't know me
Don't be a groupie keep it movin
Shorty you don't know me
Hey I ain't trippin pimp the truth is
Really you don't know me
Ya you know they call me T.I.
But you don't know me
You be hatin and I see why
'cause you don't know me
[Verse 1:]
I think its time i made a song fo people who don't know me
I graduated out the streets, Ima real OG
I been trappin shootin pistols since I stood 4 feet
So all you Rappers actin bad, you gon have to show me
You gone make me bring da chevy to a real slow creep
My Partner hangin out the window, mouth fulla gold teeth
When the guns start poppin, wonder when its gonna cease
choppa hitchu on the side and create a slow leak
We can end the speculation 'cause today we gone see
What's the future of a sucka who be hatin on me
i don't care about the feds investigation on me
I don't care they at my shows and they waitin on me
Ima keep a flossin poppin long as Toomp is on the beat
Tell police that I ain't stoppin Ima keep it in the streets
Contrary to yo believes, im as real as you can be
So keep ya thoughts and yo feelings shorty you don't know me.
[Chorus:]
You might see me in the street
But Shorty you don't know me
When ya holla on the street
Rememba you don't know me
Save all the hatin and the poppin
Pimpin you don't know me
Quit tellin People you my partna
Listen you don't know me
Don't be a groupie keep it movin

[Verse 2:]
Hey once again let me remind you pimpin you don't know me

I don't know if you wearin wires you could be the police
If I was slangin dope you couldnt get an OZ
See me at the PSC follow thru and tha show deep

I just wanna wrap a C, blowin dro ina fleet
Only hittin bout a dozen different freeks ina week
I just wanna chill with Kuntry and his daddy Freddy G
Ballin out @ anytime, hit every store and spend a G
Wanna ball in the Bahamas curtousy of KT

Ak house on the hill right next to JG
Everyweek meet there for lunch, restaurant and eat free
Get inda paid Lil Craig an G
That's the only shot we got at gettin Cap back on the streets
[Chorus:]
You might see me in the street
But Shorty you don't know me
When ya holla on the street
Rememba you don't know me
Save all the hatin and the poppin
Pimpin you don't know me
Quit tellin People you my partna

[Bridge (x2):]
