Lets keep grindin'we can make it, let's keep grindin'we can make it
Little getto boy livin' in the big rig city you've got to get out and get it or you live no more
We got niggaz killin' people for pennies and most popo won't even visit cuz in looks like war
And if you really stop and think about it it's got to be a set up down here
I think there's a set up down here
Ain't nothin' but a set up down here
