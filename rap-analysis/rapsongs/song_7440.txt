[Intro:]  Holocaust punishment Wu-Tang Yo, yo, yo, yo Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo  [Verse 1:]  From the hills of the Pacific I bring fury and anger Stabbing devils in their chest with a rusty ship anchor Blood and sand we command and conquer Wasted land,  Then expand the regions undiscovered by modern man Body counts increase by thousands by the hour The sniper on reserve blastin hots from the water tower Absorbin' energy from the sun MC's run Blood on the pavement My brain burst like to blow chunks outta you lungs Crews gaze in amazement I was doing that to niggaz who test me on the slave ship Murder you at hell's gate daring bitches to yell rape We sell tapes and stage jail breaks for past cell mates And pale face gests hollow points I swallow joints My voice ensemble of bullets rip through your squadron With romantic charisma that'll make your momma moist Circulate the planets move back you better dodge 'em Or get opened up like a margin Buddah sargeant,  Christ I should've warned you I never missed a target Relentless remorse is guiltless and unclean The living weapon war machine by buried king Also the sources supreme of my team Black Knight brigade peels caps like tangerine Holocaustic, hypnotic, psychotic, sub-atomic,  psychopathic, hyperactive, unattractive  [Chorus] We bring nothing but punishment Like nice be runnin' shit have 'em runnin' quick Uppercuts is what we coming with Fuck the government I grab the mic, that's when the thunder hit Never love a bitch Rhymes echo throughout the dungeon pits [REPEAT]  [Verse 2:]  Something from my culture The way of life that best suits me I stay to harmony Freedom and raw The Abbott I sincerely love Allah's mathematics Which is 4 times 90 why niggaz trues dare I rest within the square The dominant intelligence 99 elements we're offspring celibate Without knowledge life's irrelevant I wrote the benevolent (Wu-Tang eminent)  [Verse 3:]  I bring lyrics to existence When I speak these powerful words The priest of pandimonium the wargod has emerged Above sea-level that's when thunder rolls  and lightning strike down Atrocity lay that poor ass and rain it for you compund Chaotically the Black Knights we move erotically MC's microscopically Lyrically perform labotamy on your biology a prodigy A philosophy and theology my idiology's to break down The ghetto tropically gettin' more hectic by the second And hit kids cause niggaz spit wigs with no precautions Ghetto warfare straight bullets hit off the window sectors The war I raise down from their grave to haunt your concious Of niggaz haunting you through dark alleyways With bloody screams nightmares and bloody dreams Through missing smoke screen Have you tweaking like a crack fiend  On high bean like Christine  [Chorus] The lords rain supreme  [Verse 4:]  I'm original mallot With metaphor dominant intelligence I give a nigga a hardcore detention with his  birthstar invention To break free from this evil mad society I was mentioned I be creeping with the intention  Don't lie to me I'm dope, I scope stuff I like to telescope To provoke from being choked And let me open up your insides Cause my ability is soul lying And man hide,  Static got you lighting and moving Not from confusion with this high energy I'm using Through the abyss where snakes hiss For following false elements And many men get pissed for following false elements  [Chorus] [repeat last line 2x]
