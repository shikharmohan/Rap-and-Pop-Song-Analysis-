Those Hollywood nights
They drive me crazy
Those Hollywood nights
They drive me crazy
Those Hollywood nights
They drive me crazy
Those Hollywood nights
They drive me crazy
Huh, it's like that that there
They love it when I let down my hair
From Jessica Alba to Jessica Simpson
Even Jessica Biel wanna know how I feel
So I let 'em all come to my back table
Roll up and lick the paper if they able
Bottles of everything, models and everything
Everything goes and yes, I mean everything
**** castles, I ain't sniffin'
But baby, that plate in that one movie is trippin'
So I invite her over to my party
Blond hair, long legs, a real live Barbie
No autographs, I ain't signin' now
Act like you been around a boss, ****settle down
My life is like one big highlight
Welcome to the **** Hollywood nightlife
Those Hollywood nights
They drive me crazy
Those Hollywood nights
They drive me crazy
Those Hollywood nights
They drive me crazy
Those Hollywood nights
They drive me crazy
Every night I'm in the limo, Excursion
With some whites, some Asians and Persians
They flirtin', and I'm certain they ****
One night with the Dogg and it's curtains
She say she wanna be an actress
So I pointed to these **** and then I yelled, "Action"
Take one, take two, now cut
Now turn around and let the homie Damani ****
Huh, yeah, here we go again
I gotta go behind the club just to get in
They say I'm just too much commotion
All the yellin' and screamin' and pushin', oh yes, I got 'em open
I'm in the back of the club gettin' a backrub
Smokin' with one of the Marley's, 'One Love'
I'm higher than gas, refusin' to pass
Hollywood night school my **** join my class, c'mon
Those Hollywood nights
They drive me crazy
Those Hollywood nights
They drive me crazy
Those Hollywood nights
They drive me crazy
Those Hollywood nights
They drive me crazy
Meet me at the Roosevelt, bass cabana room
I'm on Sunset at The House of Blues
I just stepped in for a quick cameo
Me and Leonardo DiCaprio
He keep a bad ****, I keep a bad ****
He slide me new **** everywhere we go
Oh, the life, night after night, flight after flight
Yes, these Hollywood nights
I have a **** burnt out, some **** turned out
You know it's pimpin' when you see the Dogg permed out
Cameras flashin', police passin'
Every little model wanna give me some action
So I let 'em kick it then I let 'em **** it
Get some [Incomprehensible] durin' every visit
I wouldn't leave it even if they paid me
The L.B. raised me and Hollywood is crazy
Those Hollywood nights
They drive me crazy
Those Hollywood nights
They drive me crazy
Those Hollywood nights
They drive me crazy
Those Hollywood nights
They drive me crazy
