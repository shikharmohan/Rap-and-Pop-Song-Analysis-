You know what? I'm destined to be the last man standin'
Carefully mappin' my escape through plannin'
Come in and get it, and leave here with it
Makin' fo' sho' that I'll be free when I hit
It's like a dope man's lotto, the dope man follows
The rule here is simple and this is my motto
To get it how you get it homey, Marciealago
Get you a house built keep you a dollar though
'Cause when it's over it's over, no cheese to borrow
You fuck around, get indicted, ain't no tomorrows
My homey locked up, been six years tight
But six years is nothin', 'cause this kid's life
Is off in a cage for the rest of his days
A price that he paid for the mistake he made
So I'm more focused 'cause my lifestyle's bogus
I got to get out 'cause this fast life's over
You've got seasons to rise
And moments to descend
You'll find peace in the end
Don't cry, the secret is to win
You've got seasons to rise
And moments to descend
You'll find peace in the end
Don't cry, the secret is to win
They say, "The ends justifies the means"
So I guess a drug dealer justifies the fiends
Poverty and unemployment justifies the screams
The reason he stacks his paper just to buy it clean
Two thousand and six with shoes the size of me
But in the end he wasn't really what he tried to be
I'd never let no war justify me
I question how hard some of these cats really be
'Cause real niggaz don't speak, our actions talk more
Don't make me flip and turn these streets into a chalk board
I do this for all the real niggaz that smoke trees
The hustlers, players, pimps, and OG's
For the up-and-comin' cats to the old schoolers
The ones that remember private stock and Calvin Coolidge
It's a struggle to make it, keep pushin'
See how far you can take it, two eye or one eye navigate it what
You've got seasons to rise
And moments to descend
You'll find peace in the end
Don't cry, the secret is to win
You've got seasons to rise
And moments to descend
You'll find the peace in the end
Don't cry, the secret is to win
I know this cocksucker pullin' me over because of my skin
But the secret is to win, so I hold it in
I'm yes sir'n, no sir'n, but when he pull off he diss
A motherfuckin', dick-suckin', redneck son of a bitch
All it takes is one pussy who ain't gettin' none
To catch you on a dark street, and put you to sleep
Dude was one deep, at the sto', he said, "I ain't no ho"
Got clapped in the back of his 'fro
It didn't have to go like that, believe me Mister
Someday, niggaz gon' respect these pistols
Play the safe, get out the way, when a fool got the ups
Pride'll get a motherfucker shot in the guts
And remember this before you grown, and the day that you gone
Greed it don't last too long
The secret is to win, jump out the game and have money for life
Not to stick around 'til you lose all your shit to the vice
You've got seasons to rise
And moments to descend
You'll find peace in the end
Don't cry, the secret is to win
You've got seasons to rise
And moments to descend
You'll find peace in the end
Don't cry, the secret is to win
