I come to you hungry and tired, you give food and let me sleep
I come to you weak, you give strength and that's deep
You called me a sheep and lead me to green pastures
Only asking that I keep the focus in between the chapters
You give me the word and only ask that I interpret
And give me the eyes that I may recognize the serpent
You know, I ain't perfect but you'd like me to try
And just like the devil who wants me to lie till I die
Lord why is it that I go through so much pain?
All I saw was black and all I felt was rain
I come to you because it's you who knows
To show me that everything is black because my eyes were closed
You gave me the light and let me bask in your glory
So it was only right that when you asked for this story
I put together to do our dogs some good
Our dogs being brothers and sisters in the hood
Plenty of times you sent help my way but I hid
And I remember once you held me close but I slid
There was something that I just had to see
That you wanted me to see so I could be what you wanted me to be
And I think I've seen it 'cuz I don't feel the same
Matter of fact, I know, I have seen it I can feel the change
And it's strange almost got me beating down your door
But I have never known love like this before
It's a wonderful feeling to get away from the pain
And up under the ceiling I get away from the rain
And the strain that I feel when I'm here is gone
I know real so I wipe away the tears it's on
And I almost lost faith in you when you took my man Monty
Pass over chase a brother down and I fear that what I saying
Won't be heard until I'm gone
But it's all good, 'cause I really didn't expect to live long
So if it takes for me to suffer for me brother to see the light
Give me pain till I die but please Lord treat him right
