Start with straight shots and then pop bottles
Flirt wit the hood rats then pop models
Start with straight shots and then pop bottles
Flirt wit the hood rats then pop models
Okay we poppin' champagne like we won a championship game
Look like I got on a championship ring
Cuz I ball hard, no bitch we ball harder
I am the Birdman, and I'm the J.R.
Okay, start straight shots and then pop bottles
Pour it on the models, shut up bitch swallow
If you can't swallow, shut up bitch gargle
Straight up out the water wit my Mark Jacob's goggles
I'm fresher than a muthafucker, yup I'm a muthafucker
No I wouldn't take ya girl but I shall take her tongue from her
Could you tell I'm in love woman, like no other woman?
Oh I'm sorry sweetheart, I thought you were my other woman
Start with straight shots and then pop bottles
Flirt wit the hood rats then pop models

Okay we poppin' champagne like we won a championship game
Look like I got on a championship ring
Cuz I ball hard, no bitch we ball harder

Now as I recline behind my desk
I ain't got a lot of Nikes, but I got a lot of cheques, money
Got my own shoe, brand new on the set
Went from sittin' in a cell to sittin' on a jet
From shittin' in a cell to shittin' on a jet
I lost too many friends but I won too many bets
I made too much money I ain't made enough yet
So I scratch, and yes Junior is the best, shawty
So many niggaz throw my hood on they back
So many niggaz from ya hood on they back
That's why we so paid and it be like that
I rather pop a bottle, befo I pop a gat
Start with straight shots and then pop bottles
Flirt wit the hood rats then pop models
Start with straight shots and then pop bottles
Flirt wit the hood rats then pop models
Okay we poppin' champagne like we won a championship game
Look like I got on a championship ring
Cuz I ball hard, no bitch we ball harder
I am the Birdman, and I'm the J.R.
Yea, only sippin' red champagne
White tee, red hat, red bandana
Uptown, choppers struck upon ya
Fuckin' wit the Birdman we choppin' yo propane
Fuckin' wit my son and we run up in ya mansion
Chopper make music, bitch start dancin'
Stunna man back, so you know the circumstances
And I'm cookin' up the Carter 3 no advances
All my cars automative, automatic
No lie, we don't even drive no askin'
Uptown, we packin' and we stackin'
Young Money, Cash Money we the champion
Start with straight shots and then pop bottles
Flirt wit the hood rats then pop models
Start with straight shots and then pop bottles
Flirt wit the hood rats then pop models
Okay we poppin' champagne like we won a championship game
Look like I got on a championship ring
Cuz I ball hard, no bitch we ball harder
