Yeah, definitely, definitely, definitely dawg
Definitely, definitely k-mart
Yeah, yeah
You find me offensive? I find you offensive
For finding me offensive
Hence if I should draw a line on any fences
If so to what extensive
Any, should I go? 'Cause it's getting expensive
Being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
They say that I cause extensive
Psychological nerve damage to the brain when I go to lengths this
Far at other people's expenses
I say your all just too goddamn sensitive
It's censorship and it's down right blasphemous
Listen to shit now 'cause I won't stand for this
And Chirs-stiff-pher Reeves won't sit for this neither
And let's clear this up too I ain't got no beef with him either
He used to be like a hero to me
I even believe I had one of those 25 cent stickers on my refrigerator
Right next to Darth Vader
And Darth must have put a hex on him for later
I feel like it's my fault cause of the way that
I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luther
I killed Superman, I killed Superman
And how ironic? That I'd be the bad guy
Kryptonite, the green chronic
'Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain, nice to meet you
Hi, my name is
I forgot my name
My name was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil my new name is
Rain man
Now in the Bible it says
Thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed
Have homosexual sex
Unless of course you were given the consent to join in
Then of course, it's intercourse and it's bi-sexual sex
Which isn't as bad, as long as you show some remorse for your actions
Either before, during or after preforming the act of that which
Is normally referred to have such, more commonly known phrases
That are more used by today's kids
In a more derogatory way but
Who's to say, what's fair to say and what not to say?
Let's ask Dr. Dre, Dr. Dre?
(What up?)
I gotta question if I may?
(Yeah)
Is it gay to play putt-putt golf with a friend
(Yeah)
And watch his butt-butt when he tees off?
(Yeah)
But, ut! I ain't done yet
In football the quarterback yells out hutt-hutt
While he reaches in another grown man's ass
Grabs on his nuts but just what if
It was never meant it was just an accident
But he tripped, fell, slipped and his penis went in
His teeny tiny little round hiney but he didn't mean it
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit
And I don't mean to go in into any more details but
What if he pictured it as a females butt?
Is that gay? I just need to clear things up
Till then I'll just walk around with a manly strut because
'Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain, nice to meet you
Hi, my name is
I forgot my name
My name was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil my new name is
Rain man
You find me offensive, I find you offensive
Shit, this is the same verse I just did this
When am I gonna come to my good senses?
Probably the day Bush comes to my defenses
My spider senses telling me Spiderman is nearby
And my plan is to get him next and open up a whip ass canister
Goddamn it Dre where is the goddamn beat?
Anyway, anyway I don't know how else to put it
This is the only thing that I'm good at
I am the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic
Demonic, yep yep, don't worry I'm on it
I got it, high five Nick Lachey
Stuck a pen in Jessica's head and walked away
And she blew around the room like a balloon a
Grabbed the last can of chicken tuna
Out the trash can and screw my
Head is straight back to the Neverland ranch
With a peanut butter, jelly, chicken, tuna sandwich
And I don't gotta make no goddamn sense
I just did a whole song and I didn't say shit
'Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain, nice to meet you
Hi, my name is
I forgot my name
My name was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil my new name is
Rain man
'Cause I
Yo, rain man
Definitely, definitely Dr. Dre, super dope beat maker
Two thousand and two thousand four hundred and eighty seven million
Nine hundred and seventy three thousand four hundred and sixty three
And seventy
