Ha, welcome 2 da Bricks
The city where tha rats'll whoop your mutherfucking ass, nigga
Yo, during tha day mutherfuckers work out here
Just like anybody else, to make ends meet, ya know?
Whether it's fast food or transportation
Sneaker store, doing hair or straight up stripping
We gotta get tha cash, we gotta get the mutherfucking doe
Brick City is an industrial city, a cold city, a heartless city
A lot of kids grow up here man wanting to be somebody, ya know?
George Clinton called us the Chocolate City
90 percent black and sugar free
Lot of famous people from tha Bricks, baby
Better do your homework and check it out, ya know?
I love tha bricks yo, ya ask me on a nice day
You can shine your car up, joy ride through tha hood
Hit a cook out, pool party, whatever
Straight up getting your swerve on whether bitch or nigga yeah
Daytime's tha shit out here in tha Bricks boy, I love it
But when night time comes tha monkeys come out
Crackheads, hustlers, chickens, carjackers, thieves, hoes
All these mutherfuckers come out when the lights go out
Don't matter how large your crew is
Don't matter what city your stinkin' ass is representin'
Give a fuck how much money you got nigga
You come to tha Bricks you easy prey
For a mutherfucker to dig in them pockets
