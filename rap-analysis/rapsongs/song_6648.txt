Like a star, slipping out of place
Sliding from the sky, tumbling through space
When you touch my hand
I swear, I feel like I'm ballin', yeah I'm ballin'
Like a wheel, whirling round and round
Rolling down a hill, spinning on the ground
Your kissing makes me dizzy, yeah
In the head and I'm ballin', I'm ballin'
I love this game 'coz this game love me back
I'm pushing a lac, smoking sacs like a mad mac
Bringing me back, banging the 8-track track
The Dramatics and Battle Cat and Snoop like that
Big stars in big cars we pull up at the big clubs
And sit at the big bars
Sippin' champaign with a bowl of cavier
Hell yeah you are, yeah you are
Say it, say it, 'coz they all deny it
Player, play it, 'coz you can't deny it
As fly as it get, as fly as I spit you know it's the shit
It's so gangsta, gangsta bitch
Switch back to the old school, old fools know
This here thang we do so original
I got to have it, lavish is how we establish
On the real love one it feels good to have
Like a rose, flippin' down the street
Looking oh so sweet, bumpin' to the beat
These streets they keep me busy, yeah
Makin' bread and I'm ballin', yeah I'm ballin'
Oh, here I go, ballin' making dough
Working for myself 'coz it thrills me so
I keep women on my line 'coz they know
That I'm ballin', yeah I'm ballin'
Oh, here I go, driving down the road
I can't help myself, ballin' thrills me so
Yeah, you blew my mind
And I know , I'm ballin', yeah I'm ballin'
Do that, who that, you that one they called on
Baller' get your ball on
It's all on now fall on to a new groove
Really ain't nothing to prove
We, set the mood
Or shoot some pool
Or blaze a Cool
What? Whatup fool
Now you can cruise if you choose but I prefer to do the cha-cha
And once my small kitchen throw
You know I gotcha
Watch out, no need to pull your glock out
It's a players affair, now
Look at my hair and the girls wit' me
They got the same thang on
Pimp, pimp parade, my nigga get your bang on
'Coz my uncles about to get their sang on
And all round the world, my nigga, it's the same song
And when it's time for your callin', fallin', wit' no stallin'
Keep it ballin'
He starts to mill just rollin' through his town
Stacking dollar bills, raising Dogg pound
Because he's loved, loved in every city
That's why he's ballin', yeah he's ballin'
There it is 'coz it is there
Now have a seat and come hit the game from a player
They say time brings change and change brings time
It's so genuine and so divine
It's been so long in fact it's overdue
Now tell me baby girl what can D-O-Double-G do for you
I fell for you, I'll always look over you
There's really not much that a player wouldn't do for you
So quit stallin' and fallin'
And come get a bar of some of this ballin'
Now quit stallin' and callin'
And come get ya'self a bar of this ballin'
Yeah, that's right, this is ahh, radio station 187.4 DG
Sock it to your ass with something from The Dramatics
And Snoop Dogg, let them spot that okay
It's another one of those world premiers
Doin' it to ya doggystyle, in ya air hole
For the 2000 plus 1, yeah
