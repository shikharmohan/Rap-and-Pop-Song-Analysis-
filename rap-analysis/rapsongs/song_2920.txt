I know she gone, but I'm still holding on
Still smell the scent of her clothes, only God knows the pain
I cried 'til there's no tears left
Love my babies, we can't explain why she left
I'm all alone, feeling like my heart is blown
I do anything just to see her come back home
But she chose not to hold on, and broke the bond
Left me with two babies like I'm Mr. Mom
But I'ma handle what God gave me, 'cuz I'm a good man, and
Try to break me down, I'm strong and stay standing
Never imagine she gettin' down like that
Nine years in this together and you turning your back? Come on
All we can do is hold on
All we can do is hold on
All we can do is hold on
All we can do is hold on
I can't believe you walked out of my life
Not saying I was perfect, babe, but I was willing to work it
I know the grass look greener, but you should have stayed beat
Let a good man go, so you can run free?
Could of held on to these rough times and made better ones
Left me when my music was down with no fun
Broke, I struggled so you made it through college
'Cuz I had street smarts, but you had knowledge
Longevity, suppose to be together forever
Now you say we growing apart? Whatever, whatever
So I'ma open the cage and set my butterfly free
Just hoping it ain't too late when you come on back to me
All we can do is hold on
All we can do is hold on
All we can do is hold on
All we can do is hold on
But I'ma try to hold on and be strong
'Cuz this time, you're so wrong
But I wait and I long
For your touch but you're gone
All these tears and all this pain
I'll never, never feel the same
I keep control, I lift my soul
I sing my song, I hold on
All we can do is hold on
All we can do is hold on
All we can do is hold on
All we can do is hold on
All we can do is hold on
All we can do is hold on
All we can do is hold on
All we can do is hold on
