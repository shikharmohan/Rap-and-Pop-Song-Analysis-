LL and, Lil' Mo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ohh, oh
When I cry, baby, you cry
When we cry, baby, it's like
You know, ohh, oh, how love goes
Say it again
When I cry, baby, you cry
When we cry, baby, it's like
(Yeah)
You know
(Ohh, oh)
How love goes
(Now give it to 'em)
How ever it go I'm going out for you, girl
If I'm a stick up kid I'm pulling out for you, girl
If I was hustling I'd pump coke for you, girl
If I was a dread then I'd smoke for you, girl
I play captain, rock the boat for you, girl
I play martin and bring hope to you, girl
When I was away look how I wrote to you, girl
Wasn't I polite when I spoke to you, girl
Tricked on you cop that coke for you, girl
I'd do anything but go broke for you, girl
Since I'm a rapper I wrote a song for you, girl
Since I'm a gun clapper I keep it warm for you, girl
Lift some weights and keep it hard for you, girl
Sunday morning pray to God for you, girl
If that don't work catch a charge for you, girl
Or flip some bars become a star for you, girl
When I cry, baby, you cry
(You cry)
When we cry, baby, it's like
You know ohh, oh, how love goes
Come on, say it again
When I cry, baby, you cry
(Baby)
When we cry, baby, it's like
(Yeah)
You know
(Ohh, oh)
How love goes
(Just how love goes)
If I was a pastor I'd preach for you, girl
If I was a hand then I'd reach for you, girl
Grab a broom and sweep the streets for you, girl
Become the President and get in peace for you, girl
I keep having these visions in my mind
No since, no reason, no rhyme
Schizophrenia is hard to define
Life's a mountain for you, I'm ready to climb
Become the sun for you I shine
Much more than all your other guys combined
So you can tell them all to wait in line
'Cause a crime of passions still a crime
Life ain't a movie, girl, you cant rewind
But I play any role just to make you mine
Even in the mirror you're one of a kind
And I don't need nobody else to co-sign
When I cry, baby, you cry
(You cry)
When we cry, baby, it's like
(ooh, oh, oh)
You know
(Ohh, oh)
How love goes, say it again
When I cry, baby, you cry
(Woo, woo, wo, ow)
When we cry, baby, it's like
(Yeah)
You know
(Ohh, oh)
How love goes
(Just how love goes)
Take it to the bridge
There ain't nothing I wouldn't do
I cook and clean when it comes to you
I keep it locked don't ever fear
When it comes to my man I'm a be right here
Keep it hustle when times are tough
Never left me stranded it was all about us
Kept coming home, kept running strong
This love is meant to be life long
Life is good when it's me and you together
And when there's drama then I'm a do whatever
Keep you warm in the stormy cold weather
Leave you broken and lonely, oh, never
Every work that I say is so clever
When you feel it in your heart it gets you much wetter
I am the original go getter
I don't waste time fronting I go get her
Stare at the devil and won't blink for you, girl
Change the way that I think for you, girl
Put it on paper waste the ink for you, girl
Walk through the dessert without a drink for you, girl
Central booking, rock pink for you, girl
Step in quicksand and sink for you, girl
Whatever the obstacle I'm a leap for you, girl
End my life and go to sleep for you, girl
When I cry, baby, you cry
(You cry)
When we cry, baby, it's like
(Yeah)
You know, you know
(Ohh, oh)
How love goes
When I cry, baby, you cry
When we cry, baby, it's like
(Yeah)
You know
(Ohh, oh)
How love goes
(Just how love goes)
