It's Britney, bitch
And Lil' Kim, hoe
Kimme, kimme more
'Cause too much is not enough
All this liquor in my cup
Got me dancin' like a slut
Fans are screamin' Kimme more
'Cause too much is not enough
Can you feel the Trinamin' rush?
Kim and Brit, all eyes on us
(All eyes on us)
Every time they turn the lights down
  (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Just wanna go that extra mile for you
  (Give it to me, give it to me)
Public display of affection
  (What, what, what?)
Feels like no one else in the room
(But you)
We can get down
Like there's no one around
We keep on rockin'
  (We keep on rockin')
We keep on rockin'
  (We keep on rockin')
Cameras are flashin'
While we're dirty dancin'
They keep watchin'
  (They keep watchin')
Keep watchin'
Feels like the crowd is sayin'
Kimme, Kimme more

Center of attention, that's us, that's us
Even when we're up against the wall, ha,ha, ha
You got me in a crazy position
If you're on a mission, yeah
You got my permission, oh
   (Lil' Kim and Britney Spears)
We can get down
Like there's no one around
We keep on rockin'
  (We keep on rockin')
We keep on rockin' rockin'

Cameras are flashin'
While we're dirty dancin'
They keep watchin'

It started as a dirty dance
And it led to a one night stand
Damn, I'm hookin' up with a fan
Tell you what, we freakin' with this video cam
I'm such a dirty whore
Shake your body till it's sore
Everybody hit the floor
Feelin' hot and sexy
  (Lil' Kim and Britney Spears)
Got 'em sayin', sayin'
