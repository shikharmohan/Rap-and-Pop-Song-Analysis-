Ladies and gentlemen
There are seven acknowledged wonders of the world
You are about to witness the eighth
Space ain't man's final frontier
Man's final frontier is the soul
Guided by someone more powerful than any human being
Someone felt but never seen
You will be surprised of what resides in your insides
Do it again
C'mon y'all
C'mon y'all
Do it
Imagination[Incomprehensible]
Do it [Incomprehensible] do it
[Incomprehensible]
One, two, three, four
[Incomprehensible]
Three, four
With a rhythm as complex as life itself
And a soul that's in boom
Like the speakers in your ride
You never thought it would happen
It's 'Arrested Development' y'all
Yo, stop, hold it, free, now
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Incomprehensible]
C'mon y'all
C'mon y'all
This is the country, deep in the country
Deep south, man[Incomprehensible]
South of Africa[Incomprehensible]
Be back [Incomprehensible]
[Incomprehensible]
