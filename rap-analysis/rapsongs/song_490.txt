Dedicate this to all the niggas on the streets; niggas in the hood strugglin', doin' what the fuck they gotta do to make their money; and all the thugs, the hustlas, the gangstas, the playas, pimps. Let's roll, let's roll.[. . . ghetto love, ghetto love. I can feel that ghetto love, ghetto love . . .]
Street people [people] All my people be them niggas with an attitude. [We're ready for war.] The street mentality: it's do what you gotta do [do what you gotta do]. 
I dedicate this to the niggas in the hood [Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?], keepin' it real on the street. Niggas they practice what they preach, stayin' true until they D-I-E. Niggas still strong. We keep on bailin' through the stress and all the rest of the shit that's goin' on. Speakin' of violence, I see, you got to keep a pistol, 'cause if niggas think you're rich, you gon' be got, they out to pinch ya. Bullshit you not--killin' because of the pump, and it drives us to the point of no return, especially when you 're gone off of the sherm. You could give a fuck about a nigga flossin'. While you walkin', he on sixteen switches. Ain't that a bitch? But that's life. This shit ain't nothin' nice, and he'll take yours if his ain't right. And I can't stop 'em or knock 'em, but yo, I wouldn't even try, though. 'Cause Bible say, "Hey, either repent or you will die." So [so, so], choose one [just one]: either repent and get saved, or put some food on your table for now.

Krayzie [with Niko]:
I see my sisters out there hustlin', man [strugglin', man.]. Do what it takes, but that's the brakes, rustle up what you can. Gotta feed your babies [babies, yeah]. Handle yourself your own business--don't wait on that nigga to get you nothin'. We been poor long enough, and I know you would scheme on somethin' [somethin', yeah]. Take the welfare, fuck it! The system givin' it to you, 'cause it's guilt on they conscience. Don't let 'em fool you [don't let 'em fool you, no]. Really ain't doin' a nigga any favors, so come on and get the paper, paper, before you die, die. This verse is for my ghetto queens, tryin' to come up and get them better things, particularly cheddar cheese. Make that money [Make that money]. Work, work, work. Whatever your occupation, as long as you bringin' home the bacon, bacon, bacon. Don't let your enemy lock your mind, too. And I hope y'all really been payin' attention 'cause it's 1999, ooh. [Ooh-ooh, 
yeah.] Though people comin' around, we gon' thug. So where the thugs at? Gimme some of that ghetto love [ghettp love].

Now if y'all feelin' me, let's get down and tear the roof off the mother. Shoot the muthafuckas! I'm serious and mean business. Ready to pump pump and ride, you with it? Come on, put it out there. Pump, pump, pump police. They treat us like animals--let's attack 'em like beasts. But hold on: 'fore you start fightin' [hold on, hold on], let's brighten up the action scene, pass me the gasoline [no more, no more]. I'm really not trippin' on this rappin' no more, 'cause I know it won't last too much longer . When it's over, then I be a full-time soldier [I told you], if I make it out of the game with all my sanity. Get paid, fuck the fame, get out quickly. Understand me? 'Cause at the rate I'm goin', pretty soon they'll try to ban me for killin' these muthafuckas tryin' to tamper with my family. Now they got me runnin' from these po-po's, tryin' to jam me, but I told them muthafuckas not to try to test my manly, and this is my mentality for fuckin' with the street life, street life [street life.]

Niko:
I gotta give it up to all my thugstas, we're street people. Them niggas with an attitude, let's stop the killin', we're strugglin' just like you to make a livin'. We're not pretendin', don't y'all remember? It ain't easy tryin' to stay alive, some people out there smokin' crack. My people workin' 9 to 5, just doin' it right. Real strong, hold on 'cause it won't be long before the strugglin' days is long gone, hold on, be strong.
