Yeah, heh heh, S N P, hmm, for you
Brand New, uh, uh, uh, yeah
Boy toy, I love you so
Temporary lover, never let you go
I spend my money on you
Boy toy, I love you so
Never no stress, let's keep this flow
I know you feel the same way, too
Where you been all my life, no diamonds on her fingers
But I know you got a wifey, boo, word to life
No proof, 'cause Pepa got plans for you
Reservations for two on a flight to Honolulu
No disrespect, for losin' sweats
You take the keys to my Lex, and this here blank check
So shop till you drop, thanks to hip-hop you tight
Have you fly, F.B.I. wanna indict
Bet you shit is right, got my daisies
Goin' crazy, the twenty ways you laid me, uh
Now come and bathe me, wanna get high
Take this helicopter ride
From the west side down to the east side
Pick a high rise, I'll buy, uh, you know why
'Cause you're all that, no commitments, no lies
Never settle for less, I'm the best, no stress
So rests, yes, my boy toy
Boy toy, I love you so
Temporary lover, never let you go
I spend my money on you
Boy toy, I love you so
Never no stress, let's keep this flow
I know you feel the same way, too
(Seeking)
Black female
(Word)
Seeking black male
With the nice tail, uh, not frail
(That's right)
I like 'em focused, 20-20
A man that needs little but gives plenty
I'm never vexed givin' up no sex
Unless I wanna release stress and get this shit up off my chest
Enjoy how you massage my mind, at times
Feedin' me some knowledge instead of tryin' to out rhyme
Not insecure, for sure, not bored
Send you a first class ticket when I'm out on tour
Show me a lot of love in the club
You know your place, you give me my space, stay out my face
A G worth a crystal, for you and your pals
I love to see the other women yearn waitin' on their turn
Money earnin', more money, cash, checks
But you ain't never met a girl like this yet
What's up, man? You got that package I sent you
Yeah, I got it, did you like it?
What? You know you earned it
Yeah, Put the thing down right
Boy toy, I love you so
Temporary lover, never let you go
I spend my money on you
Boy toy, I love you so
Never no stress, let's keep this flow
I know you feel the same way, too
Me and my girls chillin' at the mall, laughing and all
Brother's kinda tall, you think he play ball
Damn, you look live, hmm, so fine I think I estimate about 4.5
My pockets goes high, so we can ride
I'll pick you up about nine-ish take you to the finest, masseuse
And we can get loose, sleigh La Bouche styles
Get wild, I'll bet I leave your ass with a smile
Always a mouse, Spinderella, trick cheddar
I like a good fella but I love a boy toy better
Cheryl James, you know my name, I love the same
I check for a player with a lot of game
Not a little, not tryin' to get caught in the middle
Uh, I like my toy part like a Tonka truck
Hit the middle, uh, like Larry Zonka, what
Boy toy, I love you so
Temporary lover, never let you go
I spend my money on you
Boy toy, I love you so
Never no stress, let's keep this flow
I know you feel the same way, too
I'm not scared to tell you
S N P, it's your boy toy
All day, all night
Nine-seven, like heaven, baby
Boy toy, I love you so
Never no stress, let's keep this flow
I know you feel the same way, too
I ain't gon' front
