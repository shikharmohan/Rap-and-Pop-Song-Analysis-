Yo, Play, I never expected that from you
A guy's entitled to one mistake, Cheryl
One mistake? That ain't what I heard
Yo, what are you trying to say?
Look, let me kick it to you like this
It's not that I don't miss your kiss
Well what is it?
I'm scared of gettin' hurt, what? Much afraid
Of who? Me? Come on, baby, don't try to play me
It's true
But you know that I feel for you
Yeah, I do but, what? Yo, Play, I can't trust you
Come on, why?
How could you stand there with a straight face and ask
I ain't the first or will not be the last
You got it all wrong, those days they all gone
Yeah right, I ain't goin' out like a pawn
Come on, you make it sound like I'm a little ho
Yo, let me tell you somethin', buddy
I really don't know
Oh, I get it, now I see
I really don't know
After all the time you spent with me?
I really don't know
All the good things that we had in our mind
I really don't know
First I was sad now I'm gettin' mad
You gettin' mad?
That's right, mad
What are you gettin' mad about?
Yo, you better yo, girl, I'm tryin' to tell you
I better what? Tell me what I did
Look what I've done for you, you are ungrateful
Yo, Salt, I'm tellin' you lead that's goin' to your head
Look how you look how you dissed me
Shut up
Now how could you forget so soon
All the nights with dim lights in the bedroom
The things we said, the things we did
All the talk about the house, the cars, and the kids
Yo, I'm not sayin' those things didn't happen but
That was before I found out you was a slut
Rappin' to all the girls in and out town
It didn't take long for word to get around
Yo, if you walk out on me, I'll understand
And have to take my lumps like a man
You see, nobody's perfect, neither are we
Love is knowin' when to say you're sorry
Yes, and I apologize
You sure that's not a lie?
Yeah, cross my heart and hope to die
Just let me know what is it with you men?
And don't tell me it's a Tom and Dick thing
Is it a must you lust for every big butt?
You realize it caused the end of us?
Okay, it's understood, the things I did it wasn't good
Now can we live our lives like normal couples should?
No
No
Well, I mean, I still don't know, it may be a mistake
Don't think it's fake
I poured my heart out, and you still don't believe me?
Well go ahead then, you might as well leave me
I think you're right, though
I know I'm right
Yeah, so?
So what?
Yo, I really don't know
Come on now, I ain't gonna beg
I don't know
Didn't you hear a word I've said?
Yo, man, this ain't gonna work
Word, they're tryin' to play us like a bunch of jerks
Yo, I ain't gettin' on my knees for no one
I'm with you, true
Let's go have a cold one
Oh, you the dude
Well, how'd it go?
Oh, I don't know
At least we're still friends
Yeah, me, too
So what's goin' on tonight?
I got a date
Already? So do I
Oh yeah? That's great
