This thing right here is for my people 
In the streets, 
(swizz beats),and this thing right here will 
Take ya ass of ya feet. 
Verse one: drag-on 
They call me drag-on 
It's time to ball 
Im gonna burn'em all 
To they all say turn'em off 
These chips i gonna earn'em all 
Chicken heads know i be the kernall 
Cause i burn internall 
Mixed with the inferno 
So be careful for i burn you 
You better learn duke 
Yeah, i heard you 
But i'm gonna hurt you 
What you don't know 
Ours verse who? 
Is a virtue 
Ruff ryders be the team 
Which means 
A lot of cream 
Runin' skeems 
Stunnin' beams 
To make ya'll stop drop right on the scene 
This nigga here is to hot 
And to much 
For you to touch 
Betta tell ya man 
If two touch 
Then he too will get you bust 
You bust? 
We do 
You can ask people 
But quitly 
They don't believe us til they lead violate 
Is you buyin' this 
Cause niggaz that purchase 
Is under the dirt kid 
They call me drag-on 
I'm the youngest 
But get bunka's 
Callabo wit' my dogz from yonka's 
Plus these bronx bomba's 
Spittin' flame to the gutta 
But ya all get flamed 
Chorus x2: damion 
My dogz gon' stop 
Ya'll dogz gon' drop 
Then we gon' 
Shut'em down open up shop 
First we had'em like ooohhhh 
Now they like nnnooo 
What baby, thats how ruff ryders roll 
Verse two: jadakiss 
When i pop up 
I lock shop up 
Pull the drop up 
Park a block up 
Hit the alarm put the top up 
Stash the dro in my sock 
Then pull my sock up 
Keep the burner 
But if it's hot put my glock up 
You know what i'm about 
Slidin' off get my cock sucked 
Writin' rhymes watchin' scarface in the hot tub 
What you wanna bet 
When i pull it out 
If you don't shout 
Then every bullet will go in and out 
Who you besides kiss take a piss 
In a bottle of cryse (crystal) 
Then give it to a modelin' bitch 
And you like ya watch plain 
I'ma flood mine 
Alligator bloodeline 
Trade the finest coke 
And write one time 
Verse 3: styles 
Ya niggaz ain't hearin' me out 
Til i pop up appear in ya house 
Clearin' it out holiday style 
Everybody actin' violent and wild 
Snatch the wife silence the child 
Thats how we move 
Kill me, my man kill you 
Thats how you lose 
I ruff ryde 
I don't like to slide felt that i sliped 
And the gunz only helpin' the clip 
And the clips only my hand 
And like who the fuck is helpin' ya man 
When i cock back and hop the van 
Double r 
Get a jar 
Play the shit in the car 
Hit the party start a fight at the bar 
Snatch ya r (rolex) 
Sell ya shit for some coke 
And get the fuck out the dogde 
Verse four: eve 
Cats you, figga 
That my niggaz flippa 
With the trigger 
News teams crowd around try to flick a picture 
Get wit ya, this bitch runnin'it down to ya quicka 
Nigga not makin' sence 
Betta stay up off the liquor 
Blonde bomb shell 
Karamel, heavy spitta 
Groupies sayin' i'm they sista 
Hush ya mouth for i hit ya 
Sickenin' wise guys and thugs and bullshitta's 
Take you for a ride cover up ya eyes 
Then i hit ya

Fake niggaz play me close 
When they used to ride by ya 
Snatchin' up ya figures frontin' know

Chorus x2 
Verse 5: damion 
X is gonna hit ya niggaz hard 
Leave ya niggaz scared 
Fuckin' wit' the dog 
When you fuckin wit' the god 
Rip that niggaz heart 
Faggot niggaz saw 
Remember me from up north 
I had you scared to cough 
My name is ringin' bells 
In penatentary cells 
I makin' thugs rebell 
It ain't hard to tell 
You never really wanted it 
Saw the mic yo jumped in front of it 
Out of sixteen i'm gonna hit 
Which one of you niggaz am i gonna get 
Thought you knew what i was gonna spit 
This time, wit' this rhyme 
By the end of it 
Ya niggaz is gon' be like yo x riped it 
Did my thing as usual it's never gon' stop 
You cats can't be for real i got this shit locked 
It's not a game or a joke 
To my name or get smoked 
Simple as that simple as black 
To the throught 
Hit'em all under the coat 
Now you losen' yo life 
Rrrrrrrrr a dog is a dog for life.
