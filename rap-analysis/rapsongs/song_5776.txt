Yo, hit that bitch up, up, up, cool
We 'bout to get smoked out this bitch here tonight
When the last time you heard that shit
Damn it's been a minute nigga
Still doin' this shit
Look, look, look for y'all niggas that don't know, nigga
I really be smokin' on my smokin' songs
You can smell it?
That's that, that's that real shit you heard me
Ohh shit
Hit this shit fool
You ain't scared, huh? You can handle it?
Get you, with your pipe and, cigar, papers, scissors and cut it up
Smoke somethin', sell somethin', roll somethin'
If it ain't doeja then put up
I'm 'bout to let y'all bitches know somethin'
I'm the nigga to holla at if you really tryna blow somethin'
Scope houses, like they inexpensive
Got cushion northern lights white without tupac
And Jimmy Hendrix just like the incense
Me run outta weed, is that senseless
For instance
Imma be around this bitch smokin' till I got dentures
Three smokin' songs each who be charged you know the credentials
I mean its four smoke songs
I done got so blowed I forgot to count this one
Ain't no mystery, y'all niggas need to let that bullshit miss me
You know the history
Been smokin', keep movin' boxes of fifty
But you'd be high, could you be tipsy?
Both of 'em get a nig fucked up
Tell me now what's the difference
This that shit, the shit they can't stay woke off of
This that shit that, they can't rage the smoke off of
I'm just a rap writer, before I get my nerve back
Lemmie go get my, lemmie go get my lighter
I'm just a rap writer, before I get my nerve back
Lemmie go get my, lemmie go get my lighter
I'm just a rap writer, before I get my nerve back
Lemmie go get my, lemmie go get my lighter
I'm just a rap writer, before I get my nerve back
Lemmie go get my, lemmie go get my lighter
Smoke all over this motherfucker, bitch you ain't loaded
Cool, boom, boom, boom, boom at the doe
If you got a problem with me gettin' high
Suck a dick and die
Lemmie go get my, lemmie go get my, lemmie go get my
Lemmie go get my lighter
Y'all motherfuckers ain't loaded
Nigga if y'all was motherfukin' loaded like me
You'd have your motherfuckin' lighter up nigga
Put your motherfuckin' lighter in the sky nigga
Light that bitch up
