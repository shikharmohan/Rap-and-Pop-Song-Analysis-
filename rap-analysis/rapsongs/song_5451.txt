Me, I'm supa fly, supa dupa fly, supa dupa fly
Me, I'm supa fly, supa dupa fly, supa dupa fly
Me, I'm supa fly, supa dupa fly, supa dupa fly
Me, I'm supa fly
When tha' rain hits my window I take a puff puff
Me some indo
Me and Timberland, ohh, we tango dango
We so tight that you get our styles tangled
Sway lo dosi do like you loco, can we get kinky tonight?
Like coco, so so
You wanna play with my yo yo
I smoke my hydro on the de lo
I can't stand the rain against my window
I can't stand the rain against my window
I can't stand the rain against my window
I, I can't stand the rain against my window
Beep, beep, who got tha' keys to tha' jeep? Vroom
I'm drivin' to tha' beach, top down, loud sounds
See my peeps, give them pound, now look who it be
It be me, me, me and Timothy
Look like it's 'bout to rain, whatta shame
I got tha' armor all, shine of tha' stain
Oh, Missy, try to maintain
Freaky, freaky, freaky, freaky, freaky, freaky, freaky
I can't stand the rain, I can't stand the rain against my window
I, I can't stand the rain against my window
I can't stand the rain against my window, I can't stand the rain
I feel tha' wind
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten
Begin, I sit on hills like Lorena
Until the rain starts comin' down pourin'
Chill, I got my umbrella, my finger waves these days
They fall like Humpty
Chunky, I break up with him before he dump me
To have me, yes, you lucky
I can't stand the rain against my window
I can't stand the rain against my window
I, I can't stand the rain against my window
I can't stand the rain against my window
I can't stand the rain, I can't stand the rain
I can't stand the rain, I can't stand the rain
I can't stand the rain against my window
I can't stand the rain against my window
I, I can't stand the rain against my window
I can't stand the rain against my window
I can't stand the rain, I can't stand the rain
I can't stand the rain
