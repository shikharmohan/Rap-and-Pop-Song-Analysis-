Where my doggz at? Where my doggz at?
Where my doggz at? Where my doggz at?
Who them niggas that'll roll up to your front door
Hand on the pump, doggz nigga
Kick down the door and pull out the four
And lay niggas down for your man gettin' jumped
What kind of nigga, drunk of that liquor
High as hell with they hands in bitches' drawers
What kind of nigga fit that description
That I'm talkin' 'bout hardcore niggas brawl
And I'm a dog with lockjaw on the double R
My squad can't be knocked off, we doggz
Where my doggz at? Where my doggz at?
Where my doggz at? Where my doggz at?
Where my doggz at? Where my doggz at?
Where my doggz at? Where my doggz at?
What kind of nigga that'll steal your car at night
As soon as you turn off the lights? Yeah
Pop that steer wheel, hit the club like a quarter till
Wait till a victim get caught in the hype
What kind of nigga that'll fuck your girl, gorilla style
Ass in the air
When I come, she come, she sleep, I'm in the safe
Her boyfriend stashed the cake and I'm out of here
I know you not prepared, doc, pop the flares
For the niggas under the stairs, we true doggz
Where my doggz at? Where my doggz at?
Where my doggz at? Where my doggz at?
Where my doggz at? Where my doggz at?
Where my doggz at? Where my doggz at?
What kind of nigga that'll do a bidding
And come home doin' the same thing again, yo
That kind of nigga that'll search
For that bitch ass nigga that ratted him in
What kind of nigga keep his mind on his money
Music, not bitches at all, we don't love them hoes
That kind of nigga that don't care about your
Ice or VIP, you gettin' robbed
So take it off right now, pack my doggz
Fuck who? I'm assaultin' now, we true doggz
Where my doggz at? Where my doggz at?
Where my doggz at? Where my doggz at?
Where my doggz at? Where my doggz at?
Where my doggz at? Where my doggz at?
Where my doggz at? Where my doggz at?
Where my doggz at? Where my doggz at?
