Bass and big nuts is what it takes to get up
On the mic and enunciate or else
Your fate is disappointment but give yourself a break
Don't get disjointed from the point that you was tryin' to make
Ya know, we destined to be fresh
It ain't no secret 'cause these bitches runnin' they mouths
I guess, that's 'cause they detest us
But just rock at them Souls Of Mischief shows
That 94 flow leavin' 'em froze with an infinitesimal
Amount of aggression for MCs but still digestible
For the rest of you to ease up on it if ya wanna get with it
Ain't no opponents 'cause we pack with components to kill
React if you feel you haven't been snared and trapped
In the 92 that nigga Cas made y'all scared to rap the Hierollas
Take it as you may, I never perpetrated to this day
Or did anything that they did only catered to the way
That we created and dated to let 'em know
We kickin' that straight shit that sacred dope rhyme related
Every time they congregated it was us
Definitely somethin' to discuss, yeah
Yeah, it was you
Yeah, it was you
Yeah, it was you
Yeah, it was you
Yeah, it was you
