I can't keep
my mind off this money
my hands off my heat
(man i don't know, whats wrong with me)
im so gone
and im out here so strong and
im stuck in these streets
(I run the streets, whats wrong with me)
weed in the action and hennessy
gunnin, and point for enemies
i buck and dump em no turning back
but niggas aint never been industry
I can't keep
my mind off my money
my hands off my heat
(man i don't know whats wrong with me)
