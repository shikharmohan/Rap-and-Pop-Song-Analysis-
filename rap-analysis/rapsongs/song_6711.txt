10 lil' Crip Crip runnin' outside
All from the turf and they bangin' out rides
Far from a scrub 'cuz from the East Side
Where they don't die, they just multiply
So don't give them them a reason
To turn it into *** season
Don't give them them a reason
Well 'cuz they'll turn it into Crip season
The gangsta's back, the bank is fat
The gangsta mac in a gangsta 'Lac
Hmm, fools be like, "Break off some cheese"
Friends and enemies, oh *** please
*** You thought who punked you up?
Stop, you stuck too much, pop drop, you pluck
It's all similar to gettin' laid
On your back, on the mothaf*** case ***
I grind for my shine, 'bout my business
Lunatic on dis *** and I get ignorant
Go on and proceed to *** with ease
Wannabes, they can't believe how I leave
Look into the mind of a *** that's crazy
17 years old, still a baby
Gangstas real, they pop the pill
You *** back, young mothaf***, it's like that
10 lil' Crip Crip runnin' outside
All from the turf and they bangin' out rides
Far from a scrub 'cuz from the East Side
Where they don't die, they just multiply
So don't give them them a reason
To turn it into *** season
Don't give them them a reason
'Cuz they'll turn it into Crip season
Wake up in the mornin' lookin' funny and ***
*** a honey dip 'cuz I got money to get
Ain't no books, ain't no help, ain't no road to dis
Stay focused, young homie, that's the code to dis
Keep a *** in your pocket when you tip through the town
'Cuz there's a million mothaf*** tryna get you down
A lotta pain in this game, *** is the thang
If your money right, then you might get you a chain
But if your money is low, there's only one way to go
Jack a rapper at a local rap radio show
So mean, so clean, Crip back to tha block
Then brag to da homie, show 'em what you got
It's a gangsta jack and gangsta plaque
And they thought we just gangsta rap
Yeah, *** we take your snaps
Your shooby dooby, her rubies and your Scooby snacks
It's like 10 lil' Crip Crip runnin' outside
All from the turf and they bangin' out rides
Far from a scrub 'cuz from the East Side
Where they don't die, they just multiply
So don't give them them a reason
To turn it into *** season
Don't give them *** a reason
Well 'cuz they'll turn it into Crip season
It's a whole lotta feelin' when you on da East Side
On da East Side, we ride
And it's a whole lotta dealin' when you on da East Side
On da East Side, we ride
It's a whole lotta stealin' when you on da East Side
On da East Side, we ride
And it's a whole lotta *** when ya on da East Side
East Side, yeah, we ride
10 lil' Crip Crip runnin' outside
All from the turf and they bangin' out rides
Far from a scrub 'cuz from the east side
Where they don't die, they just multiply
So don't give them them a reason
To turn it into *** season
Don't give them them a reason
Well 'cuz they'll turn it into Crip season
They say it's crazy out here, it ain't no more fun
I can't walk down the street without my ***
