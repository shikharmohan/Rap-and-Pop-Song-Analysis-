Nigga, break yo'self, just drop, don't move
Nonetheless flesh must unfold hot, hot glocks
Drop, stalkin' gat fools
Ready to pap you if we have to, I do
Really don't know what's happenin'
Stack go thuggin' with the killas way back
Rollin' out and our goal to go tripple platinum
T's, killas from off St. Clair
Then all hell's fin to break loose
If you declare war I declare war
Sendin' my troops, swoop through
In come nuclear warheads, slay
I'm sendin' it, yo, when I pull the trigger missiles drop
Then I make your body move, dance hater
Y'all ain't ready and steady thinkin' you fuck with the thugs
Oh damn, you niggaz got tons of swift
Sharp like a double edged machete
We rollin' out, heated heavily fifty calliburs and AK's
No love for the mothafuckin' po, po
Kill 'em all and piss on they fuckin' grave
Cleveland, better believe it
We stay thievin' every last evening
I'ma retreat but proceed with ease
Leavin' 'em, Cleveland until they go home bleedin'
Me and hustlas down for the money murder
And mayhem C Land I.A., I.A.
Where them heartless thugs bail thru the wasteland
We're still from good ol' Cleveland I.A.
