Verse 1: 
The televisions have eyes 
Your modern religion is live 
Plotting a collision world wide 
Watch the hour glass the power class 
Showing currency for world supremacy 
Burroughs is burned down deliberately son 
We ain't about whats devil level 
Smell the gun metal 
King to mo' man 
I read mouths Satan 
Feel the foul taste that run on my tongue 
Burn a L for everyone of my sons 
There so much more than just herb in my lungs 
Similar to spilt Mercury, 
With enough force 
They could've killed Hercules 
This whole nation was built 
Virtually, from capital to captivity 
The earth could be the modest ?? 
You not listening 
It's cold outside 
They got the whole South side 
Using bar codes, 
Military blocks on all the state roads 
And worse, somebody's chold got hung 
They took his pants off, 
Covered his whole body with ants, and cut his hands off 
The type of shit that have your brain bleedin' 
They about to start scanning the back of niggas hands 
And get your vein readin' 
They call it New World Order 
But, son, this game is in the fourth quarter 
World War 3, don't drink the water 
Because... 
Chorus: 
These are the times that try a nigga sole 
Population control, 
We wasting time chasing gold 
They after more than your mind 
They want your nation as a whole 
It's time to take of the blindfold(I know) x2 
(A thousand men, a thousand sorrows) 
Verse 2: 
These are the times that try my thug sole 
White collar crime 
Deaf tones, gold, and drug sold 
The truth is never told 
I call it black Holocaust 
Some say all is lost 
But in the end 
Your life is all it costs 
Pronounce counter ?? 
Global 2000 ??, what they plan to do 
In case of emergency 
They building mad prisons with urgency 
Son, I solemnly swear 
They keep them slugs in the air 
Until they murder me 
Shut down the government 
Revelutionaries be lovin' it 
Clinton flee the country in a bubblejet 
Trouble is yet to come, 
For each crime, they tryin' niggas three times 
Then probably prosecute me for this rhyme 
International nickel and dime hustlers 
Move weight and muscle us around 
But my army bustin' rounds 
Shells covered the ground for miles 
Street ?? from here to Capitol Hill 
And you can read it on a dollar bill 
Chorus 
I know(I know) 
The time(the time) 
They trying to take this world(world) 
Of mine(Yeah) x2 
Verse 3: 
They breakin' windows out with canisters of tear gas 
Put out the cannabis 
We fighting canibals with silver badges 
I feel the madness in the wind 
Like a premonition 
Dee got the ammunition 
Puffin' reefer while we cleaning pieces 
None of my niggas don't believe in Jesus 
We fight a war against the ?? Chevrolet Caprices 
Whatever way we find feasible 
Sometime shit be unbelievable 
I'm seeing skeletons in parked vehicles 
Put all the terrible types behind sandbags 
My philosophy is much more than snatch your handbag 
I'm talkin' shit like hand-to-hand, 
Man-to-man, clan-for-clan 
What side you stand? 
Some of us will breakdown mentally 
Some of us will pass away 
Overwhelmed by injuries 
But our victory is meant to be 
I studied the signs for twenty-two years 
And this is what it meant to me 
Chorus x2 
I know(I know) 
The time(the time) 
They tryin to take this world(world) 
Of mine x2
