yo
yo O, yo Rae
I can't feel my face
My heart pounding and shit
Paranoid as a motherfucker right now
Who the fuck-- close them blinds and shit
who dat?
Captain Kirk?
Stark Enterprise, Enterprise shit outside or some shit?
I need some pussy, man, I'm ready to fuck Cat Woman or something
Fuck it,fuck it, let's go.
ALL AROUND THE WORLD TODAY THE KILO IS THE MEASURE
Whoever got the kilos got the candy man
A KILO IS A THOUSAND GRAMS, ITS EASY TO REMEMBER
You never catch the kid going hand to hand
ALL AROUND THE WORLD TODAY THE KILO IS THE MEASURE
Once you got the funds you got them panties man
A KILO IS A THOUSAND GRAMS, ITS EASY TO REMEMBER
Throughout I-95 I'm the handyman
Bricks, tall caps, powder,
Cooked-up crack,
Phones is tapped 
Over Franklin stacks
Kingpins put in bullpens
Old connects get paro-
Break outta town when the jakes take down the pharoah
We's there, we was moving that Peruvian white
Blowing coolies in the hoopties, slamming cuties at nights
Big heavy pots over hot stoves,
Mayonnaise jars and water
With rocks in 'em 
Got my whole project outta order
A KILO IS A THOUSAND GRAMS
Beige, gold, brown, dirty fluffy tan, extract oil puff in Cuban plants
The chemists is probably Pyrex scholars,
Professors at war, over raw
Kill they partners for a million dollars
Peace to those cooking that raw, powder white
Get your sniff on, Scarface niggas, we getting right
Some call it bricks some call it birds
How many niggas get they lives tooken
Playing with shit, then catch a curve
You could go to jail
Get caught with this 
Niggas'll grow to ?fail?
Stop playing, pot laying, baking soda and scales
They live like brothers
Word life, connect discover
Most niggas get hard 
From fucking with them pipes; and hustlers:
A KILO IS A THOUSAND GRAMS
You know your ammo better be heavy
Cuz soon kids is coming in camo
Protect your land, daddy
I'm a announcer
You get caught with a ounce or so
Matter fact, they taking you down, son
Some say a drug dealer's destiny is reaching a ki;
I'd rather be the man behind the door supplying the streets
A hundred birds go out, looking like textbooks
When they wrapped and stuffed
Four days later, staight cash: two million bucks.
Strictly powder, no cut
Your coke is flyest, what's up
Y'all beefing over little shit,
We sniff the balance quick up
In a plane or a penthouse
Office or a warehouse
Tony got nice we never hurt off any big droughts
A KILO IS A THOUSAND GRAMS
A pile of sand 
Is equivalent 
To the eye
It's nice to have a thousand fans.
Coke buyers: some be liars
Therefore you check for wires
