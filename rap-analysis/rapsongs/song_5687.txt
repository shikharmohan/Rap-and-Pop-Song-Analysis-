[Femi Kuti speaking]
One thing I want to assure them,
If they think I'm gonna change or compromise
My attitude and my way of life or
In my expression or in my goal
What's politics
They are making me stronger
And I am much much stronger now..
[Mos Def]
Check a blank to the boogie
And up chuck a boogie
To the rhythym of the boogie to be [x2]
There it go like simple the plainness
The prominent bassness
Zulu arrangement rockin' amazement
Fly gold, radiating from heaven to pavement
If only years of placement with nothing to play with
Spent time hating but that ain't changing it
God give it to me no body ain't savin' it
Therefore, moving on the base in stammerment?
Standing in the twilight and watching them get it in
Walls, simmering, the air, simmering
She movin' like more than the airs is glistenin'
Woah now
Testin' your ate in the delirium
Sounding fate booming all over your eminence
Skin on skin again
Put it all, get it all,get in then
Ladies and gentlemen, misters and mistresses
.... or entrants and simil men
There it is, boogieman
Hah
Simmer down simmer down simmer down now
Simmer down now [x3]
Quiet dog, wild hog my god
And the rocket don't stop
Brooklyn and the kids heat up the stovetop
Banging the empire state and navigating the way
Your preservation makes the greatest hip hop
The cool dudes swagger little cherry be corny
The flow so steady unsteady is boring
These dudes ain't through with their yawning
Need to get off it
So wack wack is all you can call it
Therefore, movin on the deaf is sumblin
Regardless of ...what town your representin
A bullet in the audience settlement
Tower the tenement
I mold through for all of the element
Simmer down
I manage your mayhem
I'm bright as the AM
And you're rocking more like a station
I'm blessed with the fresh from day one
I got it from day done
We all going back to the same one
It's the cost of motivation I'll stay with
Remarkable flavors
That all is a market of greatness
Woah now
Is to get us to buck town
Your girl is in love now
You thought it so funny
Shorty is down, Shoo
[Sirens]
Simmer down simmer down simmer down now
Simmer down now [x3]
Quiet dog, wild hog let's rock
Hah
And we don't stop
See you rock to the rhythm we don't stop
So you maintain the rock and you don't stop
You keep up the rock and you don't stop
(The rock)
Maintain the rock and you don't stop
(The rock)
You keep up the rock and you don't stop
(The rock)
Maintain the rock and you don't stop
(The rock)
