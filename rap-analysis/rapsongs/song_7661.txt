Yeah, just call me Young nigga
Our money's grown though
By the way, let's go, yeah
You already know what time it is, let's go
I said I'm Young by the way, the one by the way
I ain't trippin', I just do this shit for fun by the way
The truth by the way, the proof by the way
Mr. front up on me know I'm gonna shoot by the way
I said it's on by the way, I'm in the zone by the way
And you can call me Mr. Get 'Em Gone by the way
I did it by the way, I was with it by the way
I talk it like I did it 'cause I lived it by the way
Young, the boy might go nuts
Whole sale niggas just like donuts
Creme be crispy these niggas can't hear me
Must be the wrong size 'cause these niggas can't feel me
Never let 'em play me, never let 'em bullshit me
If they ever bullshit me send the coroner to get me
And when the coroner come to get me I'ma take you pussys with me
And I ain't trustin' twelve shots, no I keep them choppers with me
And I don't trust you from a block, gotta keep them shottas with me
Can't let the goons get bored, gotta keep them niggas busy
And I ain't trustin' nobody so I took my money with me
'Cause last time they got me, get me
I said I'm Young by the way, the one by the way
I ain't trippin', I just do this shit for fun by the way
The truth by the way, the proof by the way
Mr. front up on me know I'm gonna shoot by the way
I said it's on by the way, I'm in the zone by the way
You can call me Mr. Get 'Em Gone by the way
I did it by the way, I was with it by the way
I talk it like I did it 'cause I lived it by the way
Stay on it by the way, I want it by the way
Take it to your momma's momma house
Where everybody stay, where everybody sleep
Leave everybody sleep, have a baby bottle
That's everybody's freak
Baby like a dry cleaners, seen everybody's sheets
Take 'em straight to the hood, then everybody eat
They went down, I went down
Now everybody cheap or should I say cheaper
Or maybe ever lower
You niggas gettin' this shit, should I talk any slower?
Any slower it be screwed and that would be rude
I'm a man, no respect and plus I got a sack
Got the west side crackin', ask about 'em in the mess
I said I'm Young by the way, the one by the way
I ain't trippin', I just do this shit for fun by the way
The truth by the way, the proof by the way
Mr. front up on me know I'm gonna shoot by the way
I said it's on by the way, I'm in the zone by the way
You can call me Mr. Get 'Em Gone by the way
I did it by the way, I was with it by the way
I talk it like I did it 'cause I lived it by the way
