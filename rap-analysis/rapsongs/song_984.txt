[Chester Bennington] 
Together we made it 
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall 
[Busta Rhymes:] 
See you survived the worst but my life is glorious 
Betta know that i leaped every hurdle and i'm so victorious 
Take a look, I'm a symbol of greatness now you can call me Morpheus 
As for securing the win, better believe I'm so notorious 
You know that I've been buying my bread even though we rapping now (yes) 
We use to live on the strip and even though we're a higher level tramping now 
Superceded everyone of my middle struggles and 
Failure never ever has been an option 
A paper long like we was on the trap and we bout ta take the hood shoppin' 
Get it! 
[Chorus: Chester Bennington] (Busta Rhymes) *Mike Shinoda* 
Together we made it (you see we did it did it) 
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall (c'mon) 
Forever we waited (haha!) 
And they told us we were never going to get it 
but we took it on the road (to the riches) 
on the road (to the ghetto) 
on the roooooad (in the project to this bangin instrumental) 
on the road (ride with me) *yeah 
on the road (you come and get it) *yeah, yeah* 
on the roooooooad *yeah, yeah, yeah, yo!* 
[Mike Shinoda:] 
When it all got started we was steadily just getting rejected 
And it seemed like nothing we could do would ever get us respected 
At best we were stressed and the worst they probably said we're pathetic 
Had all the pieces to that puzzle just no way to connect it 
And I was fighting through every rhyme tightening up every line 
Never resting the question if I was out of my mind 
And it finally came time to do it or let it die 
So we put the chips on the table and told 'em to let it ride 
Sing it! 
[Chorus: Chester Bennington] (Busta Rhymes) 
Together we made it (you see we did itit did it) 
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall (c'mon) 
Forever we waited (haha!) 
And they told us we were never going to get it 
but we took it on the road (to the riches) 
on the road (to the ghetto) 
on the roooooad (in the projects to this bangin instrumental) 
on the road (ride with me) 
on the road (you come and get it) 
on the roooooooad 
[Busta Rhymes:] 
Look in case you misunderstand exactly what I'm building 
Things that I could leave for my children (children) children (children) 
Now I only wake up with a smile to see how far I've come 
Fighting for sales on a strip to get the hustle from 
From nights in jail on a bench using my muscles son 
To counting money like Dre and Jimmy or Russell Ross 
But now I live what I dream you see we finally did it 
Let's make a toast to the hustle regardless how you did it 
Sing it 
[Chorus: Chester Bennington] (Busta Rhymes) 
Together we made it (you see we did it did it) 
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall (c'mon) 
Forever we waited (haha!) 
And they told us we were never going to get it 
but we took it on the road (to the riches) 
on the road (to the ghetto) 
on the roooooad (in the projects to this bangin instrumental) 
on the road (ride with me) 
on the road (you come and get it) 
on the roooooooad
