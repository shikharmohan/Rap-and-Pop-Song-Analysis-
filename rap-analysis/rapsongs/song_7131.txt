Ooooooo
I've been travelin
On this road to long		dead &gone; t.i & j.t
Just trying to find
My way back home BUT
The old me
Is dead and gone
Dead and gone
Ooooooo
I've been travelin
On this road to long
Just trying to find
My way back home
The old me
Is dead and gone
Dead and gone
I turn my head to the east
I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the west
Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the north, 
Swallow that pill
That they call pride
The old me is dead and gone, 
The new me will be alright
I turn my head to the east
I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the west
Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the north, 
Swallow that pill
That they call pride
The old me is dead and gone, 
The new me will be alright
