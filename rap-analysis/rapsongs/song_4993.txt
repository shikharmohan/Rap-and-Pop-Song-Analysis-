Chorus:
Everybody's breakin' breakin' up
Let's stay together (together 2x)
Let's stay together(2x)
Yeah!
Tell Y'all a lil' story right quick
LUDA!
Verse 1:
First the Fat Boyz break up
Now everyday I wake up
Somebody  done call it quits
Shit I thought Bobby and Witney stay together forever if they made it that long
I guess the drugs weren't that strong
And now its Russell and Kamora even Jordan and Wanita
And to top it off Brad left Jen for Angelina
What the hell is going on in this World?
This just can't be!
If Will and Jada can do it then why can't we?
Hillary is still with Bill Clinton,
How did they do it
He got his dick sucked and the whole damn world knew it!    
Now Paul McCartney losing half of his life
All because he got divorced from his wife
Somebody said its cheaper to keep her 
But not in K-Fed's case (nope!)
cause Britney even had to pay for K-Fed's case (Cha-Ching!)
Nick and Jessica, Trina and Wayne
And if you broke up wit your girl
I know you feelin da pain becauseÃ¢Â¦
Chorus:
Everybody's breakin' breakin' up
Let's stay together (together 2x)
United we Stand, divided we fall
Let's stay together
United we Stand, divided we fall
Come on!
Everybody's breakin' breakin' up
Let's stay together (together 2x)
United we Stand, divided we fall
Let's stay together
United we Stand, divided we fall
Verse 2:
First it was Shaq and Kobe
then Iverson and Philly
T-O and Mcnab
Even Game and Fifty
I guess sometimes you gotta let the pass be the pass (pass)
But I give a hundred thou to see Jay with Dame Dash
BG with Lil' Wayne
Juvenile and Turk
Mannie Fresh with Baby
How can we make it work?
Crunchy with 3-6
Diamond with Crime Mob
Lauren hill with the Fugees
Remy with Terror Squad
Lil' Kill 'em back with C's
Snoop with Mo-Dray
Dray With Mo-Big Boys
CD's with Mo-Plays
Drives with no press
Salt with no pepper
Even the Eagles broke up and got the fuck back together
Selling millions of copies
And getting mad cash
And Raz B said Chris Stoke was getting that ass
I don't even understand it
What the hell went wrong?
Maybe folks will wise up and take heed to this song because
Chorus:
Everybody's breakin' breakin' up
Let's stay together (together 2x)
United we Stand, divided we fall
Let's stay together
United we Stand, divided we fall
Come on!
Everybody's breakin' breakin' up
Let's stay together (together 2x)
United we Stand, divided we fall
Let's stay together
United we Stand, divided we fall (I can't take it, Oh!)
Verse 3:
The first Wu-Tang broke up
Now Oldie B is gone
Now I'm hearing Cameron don't talk to Jim Jones
Who saw that S*** coming
Certainly not me
On a dog pound break up
Who could it mo- be
Then Shawnna almost jump S*** from DTP
If Chingy left than came back
Than damn it, why can't she?
We gotta think us of all for one
And one for all
HIP HOP
United we stand divided we Fall
So why isÃ¢Â¦?
Chorus:
Everybody's breakin' breakin' down
Let's stay together (together 2x)
United we Stand, divided we fall
Let's stay together
United we Stand, divided we fall
Common!
Everybody's breakin' breakin' up
Let's stay together (together 2x)
United we Stand, divided we fall
Let's stay together
United we Stand, divided we fall
Come on!
Everybody's breakin' breakin'up
Let's stay together (together 2x)
United we Stand, divided we fall
Let's stay together
United we Stand, divided we fall (faded Ending)
