You're the reason I don't trust no one
And I don't love no one from the places I've come
Sad songs I've sung, all the times I've been stung
For you bring the worst out of me
And I can't down these tears I've cried
The heaviness inside left me so petrified
Tried to keep love alive but I became too tired
'Cuz you bring the worst out of me
I wish I could change the way things have gone
And start life anew and now maybe once again
I don't know anywhere but something must've went wrong
And all I can say
Is when I sing this song, I get so teary eyed
'Cuz you get under my skin, can't let you suck me dry
I was gonna marry you, have kids for you stay true to you
Live life wit you, but look what you've done to me
I compromised all my time and rearranged my life
To make sure you was fine
'Cuz our love was on the line and I became so unkind
'Cuz you brought the worst out of me
This is how the story goes
Those ones who know when it's out of control
You work and you work and someone gets hurt
And I guess that be me
When I sing this song, I get so teary eyed
'Cuz you get under my skin, can't let you suck me dry
I was gonna marry you, have kids for you, stay true to you
Live life wit you, but look what you've done to me
I wish I could change the way things have gone
And start life anew and now maybe once again
I don't know when and where but something must've went wrong
And all I can say
Is when I sing this song, I get so teary eyed
'Cuz you get under my skin, can't let you suck me dry
I was gonna marry you, have kids for you, stay true to you
Live life wit you, but look what you've done to me
