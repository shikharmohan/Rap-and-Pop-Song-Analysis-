Yo, get it right from jump
Doc tapin' on debate for months
I got zits on your face that can't wait to bump
Boogie down to the point I barricade the Bronx
Papi spins the rhymes through your optilens, check it
It's five below, my brain is cold
Runny nose every time doc exchange a blow
My street team snipe the block up like Rob Lowe
Bodega liquor store, I'm dead in the window
P P P symbol got F.B.I. on lookout
Strip the dirty clothes, hit a one eighteen cookout
I wolf out, son you better buckle in
I write the madness, got ink foamin' at the pen
I tear a ligament when I spit it in the wind
I got so much game I can con Edison
Yeah chicken stand by for exposure
Shut your house down foreclosure in cold blood
Shut the power out in your house
Cut the phone put a sock in your mouth
Let da monkey out
Let da monkeys out
Show them fools what it's all about
Holla out, hear me out
Say, ooo ooo ah ah ah
Say, ooo ooo ah ah ah
Let da monkeys out
Show them fools what it's all about
Holla out, hear me out
Say, ooo ooo ah ah ah
Say, ooo ooo ah ah ah
Is Redman in the house?
(One time)
Form a line, jack ya, then pawn the shine
Stay there, runnin' with more kids than daycare
One shot prove it ain't nothin' but weight here
When he lands flat I'm the minivan
With lil' Cease, runnin' cities like Geechie Dan
When Richie Cunningham was O.P. I was low key
Airing niggaz that was more square than my gold teeth
My appetite for destruction is to hustle
All the cottonmouth'll turnbuckle when I rustle
Mr. tough guy on the side, I fuck him up too
Slam him, when I bark I marked his Buchanan
Yo, New York niggaz in the house?
Yo yo yo, is Jersey niggaz in the house?
Yo yo, I hold fort with a quart of old E from Newark
I tell lies under oath if it please the court supreme force
In the swamps with the green moss
Bug repellent suit, bustin' machines off
I'm deadly roamin' with the forty four blazin' in, no negotiator
Yo not even Chris Sabien can save your life
Doc'll creep in the house
Yo cut the phones, put a sock in your mouth
Let da monkey out
Let da monkeys out
Show them fools what it's all about
Holla out, hear me out
Say, ooo ooo ah ah ah
Say, ooo ooo ah ah ah
Let da monkeys out
Show them fools what it's all about
Holla out, hear me out
Say, ooo ooo ah ah ah
Say, ooo ooo ah ah ah
Let da monkeys out
Show them fools what it's all about
Holla out
Say, ooo ooo ah ah ah
Say, ooo ooo ah ah ah
Let da monkeys out
Show them fools what it's all about
Holla out
Say, ooo ooo ah ah ah
Say, ooo ooo ah ah ah
Yo, nineteen ninety motherfuckin' nine niggaz
Brick city comin' through

Ain't shit changed motherfucker
Pack your own heat
Supply your own motherfuckin' ammo nigga
P P P comin' through, this is Dr. Trevis
Bitch asses
