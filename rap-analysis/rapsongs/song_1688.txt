Planets be the champ of amplified sound
Swimmin' in this art born up the boogie down
The Rubin Rod Squad flew angles toward the point
Could a wierdo group of bugs slam a gang of funky joints
The provin's in the movin' of the baggy clothes
At the dimly lit clubs where flock the milk duds
Hip hop enzymes with pride kicks inside
Dig the threads the nappy heads
Bobbin' over beats that sleeps with ghetto slang
No sirens just felts and wax from ghetto brains
The cosmic child's hit with dance and beats and kits
Like the [Incomprehensible] uhh uhh and shit
The ancestors grin cause rap is gettin' fat
To some of them it's grim cause it's youth be havin' gats
So save all the cares, let down your nappy hairs
'Cause the beats is givin' life like air
The flyest fly bids is swellin' the inside
The locest loc kids left they Glocks in the ride
Hoodlums in the house gettin' they flams on
'Cause even peace got some clout when the funky jams on
Get free, get free y'all
Get free, get free y'all
Get free, get free y'all
Get free, get free y'all
Funk is you, funk is me, funk is us, funk is free
Funk is you, funk is me, funk is us, funk is free
Funk is you, funk is me, funk is us, funk is free
Funk is you, funk is me, funk is us, funk is free
Insects at the joint no flam just kickin' it
Wiggle with the fruits over by the liquids
The slick kids is down, the flyers passed around
We try to dig the group or recognize the loop
The strobe light is out in the crowd, dig my speakin'
Who you see freakin' is the native cause your seekin'
I came in the door, I said it before
Jams make me kite, if they slam then it's life remember this
Yo, silkworm's chillin'
Butterfly's chillin'
A crew of Ladybugs
We giggle with the thugs
The world is in here 'cause expressions under hair
I love my peers
You for a black jam makes you for a black man
A kid I didn't know slapped his fingers in my hand
A wisdom caught my eye damn a jams fly
Honeys with some cuties someone havin' hootie
Get free, get free y'all
Get free, get free y'all
Get free, get free y'all
Get free, get free y'all
Funk is you, funk is me, funk is us, funk is free
Funk is you, funk is me, funk is us, funk is free
Funk is you, funk is me, funk is us, funk is free
Funk is you, funk is me, funk is us, funk is free
I think every mom and dad should say to their kids
K-k-kids be free
Be whoever you are and do whatever you wanna do
Get free, get free y'all
Get free, get free y'all
Get free, get free y'all
Get free, get free y'all
Funk is you, funk is me, funk is us, funk is free
Funk is you, funk is me, funk is us, funk is free
Funk is you, funk is me, funk is us, funk is free
Funk is you, funk is me, funk is us, funk is free
Funk is you, funk is me, funk is us, funk is free
Funk is you, funk is me, funk is us, funk is free
Funk is you, funk is me, funk is us, funk is free
Funk is you, funk is me, funk is us, funk is free
Funk is you, funk is me, funk is us, funk is free
Funk is you, funk is me, funk is us, funk is free
Funk is you, funk is me, funk is us, funk is free
