this is the life I chose for me and this is the way I chose to be
A lot of fools is holding me but thatÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢s just the way itÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢s supposed to be
Never win, against the grain, always playing 20 games
Stand for something dawg or you gonna fall for anything but later for that
Yeah, I got my swag back, IÃÂ¢€Ã¢Â¢m with the Soulja Boy, that nigga bad, back
But them GCs and TCs begin the VIP, blowin on some liquor, purple trees
Jerkin knees, workin these cute bad bitches
I think they bent their knees, we gonna get them for their cheese
Break it down, spread it round, five pound
Put it in the air, right now like pronto
