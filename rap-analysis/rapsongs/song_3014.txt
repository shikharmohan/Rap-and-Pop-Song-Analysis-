Why is it you fail, to see a man
In the same hour, that his kin come grinnin'?
In another code, fell asleep, party mode, tryin' to come up
From the ashes that defy your lift, listen up
Ladies seem sweet, the ocean meets the mountain peaks
Stone-walker, side-walker, watch those loose lips, wall street
Numbers set by stock movers, buy my tip so I can touch
Not for no print size, plate saint, white wasted H2O
Four coats will make it glaze
Beams rooted like dogwood, between the pine, wind
Twenty-fo' stores with malt for sale, still fetchin' water
Out the well, help em size, find the grind, find the times
Where the times weighed as hard as [Incomprehensible]
Find me shoes, baby daddy
Rico daddy, he didn't break the TV
So why should I weep, man gon' bye, see you when my light blow
Got more good than dirt to throw, and I won't pull
Between the halo, and a fork-pitch suffocated by my rhymes
Worship high, it's just another name
Take your time and concentrate on it
Take a stand and make your hand a fist
We got a reason to resist
The mortal orbit your nadir, don't cross the fade
Chillin' in Decatur, where it's greater, secure streets
In the hood late at nights, dippin' fine
Hard not to be slippin', if they come, I won't run
When it's time, I ain't trippin', I got my date
And you got yours too, I see, the record sales soar
After the death, of this creator, genocidal, tendencies
When they mention he, who listens, to unseen hand
Cappin' the faces of the young black man, when they sing
Knowin' that we godly, got to keep it right
With my people 'cause I'm equal no matter, how much I make
I can't escape fate, the date as I await, as I await, I can't fake
Can't fake, I can't fake, I'm true with it
A duffel for the cash, platinum within myself from another earth
Spill, Nina, tea leaf, your very, existence is considered a privilege
Buck up, and they can't, be revoked pay your taxes, uhh, snake eyes
Strapped with flaws, still iterant to a lot of laws
Man made, but that's a dot, everybody
From the east coast don't wear it back home, whatchu think?
Gettin' they thoughts mixed negative, after reassurances
I say a prayer, plus if I, entertained them
It's easy to commit, hard to resist
And once we cross that line segment, not even our producers
Can bring us back, eyeballs peeled
Eardrums opened, egos stripped stroked, another low blow
Delivered to the hip-hop culture, uhh
Industry consists of thieveries, prostitutes
And folgers if somethin' bigger than us, past the blue
Told us that it wasn't a heaven for G's
Then we do this, continue your devilish deeds
I mean activities, that just show, that it's a hell
For jacks, independent, but you distributed by your masters
Labels still a slave, but you just get to eat at
The white man's table, lookin' like Gable Gunther
On the Guinness Book of World Records, God didn't like ugly
And he wasn't too fond of cute either
A climate of caution, a climate of caution in effect
Worship high, it's just another name
Take your time and concentrate on it
Take a stand and make your hand a fist
We got a reason to resist
Wherever I am, you can feel god is present, in the midst of darkness
If you spark up bet somebody gonna see it
It is necessary for me to speak these words now
Another day here hasn't been promised to me
Don't you agree that you never fail when you try
I'm willing to die but first I am willing to live
And I over stand that this will be a lifelong sacrifice
In order to reveal you gon' have to destroy
And if you ain't thinkin' right you damn sure can't act right
Somebody raise your fist and let me know I'm not alone
Revolution, doesn't mean fightin' in these streets
And it ain't gonna be no revolution without the women
And, it ain't gonna be no future without the children
And, it ain't gonna be no children without the men
And, you can't have no love without the trust
And no, trust can come without communication
And you can't communicate if you ain't got shit to say
You can't teach about what you, been deceived about too
Any book you read is still limited education
You gonna have to talk to God personally and time is short
And, He's on His way, and I will receive
A grateful word for what I've done
And this is all that really matters to me
In time you will see what I told you was true
And I ain't have to rhyme to say that to you
I ain't got to rhyme to say it to you, it's true
Worship high, it's just another name
Take your time and concentrate on it
Take a stand and make your hand a fist
We got a reason to resist
We got a reason to resist
We got a reason to resist
Resist, resist, resist
We got a reason to resist
