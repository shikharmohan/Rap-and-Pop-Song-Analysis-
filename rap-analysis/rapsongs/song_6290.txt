Got the phat groove on the reel
(Can you groove with me?)
Got the phat groove on the reel
To groove me, I need you
So put it here, baby, open your eyes
And let me groove you
Got the phat groove on the reel
So put it here, baby, open your eyes
And let me groove you
Got the phat groove
Salt-N-Pepa came back to the mic
It's not the end of the road
And like the boom in the bass about to explode
I got the rhymes to keep you goin' like petro
So everytime you see me on the mic
You know you just can't let go
So here we go again, sexy in a twin-pack
Straight from my eyes down to my back stacked
You're under my control
I got your heart and soul
Go down and take your time
I want you deep inside
So put it here, yeah, baby
Open your eyes and let me groove you
The music in my mic can move you
Like engine-engine number nine
I got the rump-shakin' flavor with the nasty rhyme
So if the crowd can move with me, move with me
Salt-N-Pepa said groove with me, groove with me
To groove me, I need you
So put it here, baby
Open your eyes and let me groove you
Got the phat groove on the reel
So put it here, baby
Open your eyes and let me groove you
Got the phat groove on the reel
To groove me, I need you
Well I'm the P-E-P-A, Pepa here to stay
And good when naughty so hip-hop hooray
I rock the mic like Anita freak a love song
I must say, yes, it's been so long
But now I'm back, bustin' phat rhymes, and I'm here to stay
So you got to give it up like Marv Gaye
You're under my control
I got your heart and soul
Go down and take your time
I want you deep inside
Yes, yes, I'm swingin' my rhymes at full speed
To groove with the style 'cause it's full breed
I bring it home like Stephanie Mills, and then I chill
Got the phat groove on the reel
So move with the tune, yeah, move with me
Salt-N-Pepa said groove with me, groove with me
To groove me, I need you
Why don't you throw it to me now?
I mean now, yeah babe, right now
Let the bass boom-boom and pow-pow me
I like my music real loud and grimey
Slick and slimey, you may try me
But can't run no bullshit by me
'Cause Wink and I, we flow to a?beat automatically
Anything else can be a?, G, see
See, see what I'm sayin'?
See the crowd swayin' to the phat joint playin'
To groove me, I need you
