Hmm hmm mm
You make me do- dooo yeah girl (yeah)
I never can erase
the love that you have placed (inside)
no girl I can't deny
I just never felt that I
would ever be the one to find the special lady that'll make me do for love
 You make me do for love
What I would not do
Everyday my love
You got me wanting you
You make me do for love
What I never do
And what we do for love
That all depends on you
A man can recognize when love is in the sky
I just had to let you rain all over me
Then one day it dawned on me
I had changed completely
I don't know just how it happened- 
but I love the way
You make me do for love
What I would not do
And everyday my love
You got me missing you
You make me do for love
(Hey) what I never do
And what we do for love
That all depends on you
No, I never thought of finding someone to love me
(Come on the road with me) And to come on the road with me
Then I opened my eyes so lovely (so lovely)
I LOVE THE WAY
You make me do
What I would not do
'cause everyday my love (everyday babe, you got me thinking for you) 
You make me do for love
What I never do
And what we do for loveÃÂ¢€"
You got me talking baby
You got me spending money
You got me trippin (tripping)
You make do- ohhhh
You make me do for love
What I would not do
'cause everyday for loveÃÂ¢€"
Everyday babe, I been missing you
You make me do for love
What I never do
And what we do for love
What we do--- depends on you
DO FOR LOVE
