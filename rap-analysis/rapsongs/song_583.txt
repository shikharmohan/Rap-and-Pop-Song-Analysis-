You better count your money
Ghetto cowboy
The name is Krayzie 'Big Bad Ass' Bone
Wanted up north for all the gold that I stole
Along with some cash
Even took the mayor's daughter
Now, that there's kidnappin', but she was with it, so I brought her
Then, got myself into a whole heap of trouble
Double-crossed by the law, so there's nobody to run to, yeah
It's just me and my sawed-off shotgun
Outlaw call him Leather Face, I'm headed for the West
Heard they got a couple banks in town that ain't been held up yet
Well, uh, I oughta make it by sundown
I figure that's enough time for me to get the whole rundown
So, I continue my mission
It's gettin' dark, so I'm watchin' for them damn
Injuns they like to catch ya, then they rob and split
I be a rootin'-tootin'-shootin' damn fool, protectin' my chips
All of a sudden, I heard somebody rumble in the bushes
Stop my horse
"Whoa, Nellie, who in the bushes?
You better speak out or I'm a let my shotgun song sing out"
Who is this? I hope this ain't the law
Jump out the bushes with my sawed-off shotgun
C'mon out, right now. I'm gettin' angry
Took a step back, 'cause it could get dangerous
Please don't shoot
It's just me, Thug Queen, the horse-stealer
Then, why the hell is you hidin'
In them bushes?
I'm wanted in four counties for armed robbery
Killed to two sheriffs, six of his best men want my head
Stole two horses
Thought you was the law, that's why I jumped in the bushes
Goodness, now, she was hotter than the barrel on fire
But I could use her for the job, so I told her to ride, c'mon
May I ask you what you headed
To the West for?
I got a partner, got a plan for some dough
And if you're down, you can pick up yourself a pretty penny
Be in town in a minute
Now be sure if you're with it
We out before the sun rise
Gotta stallion for your partner to ride
Hit the saloon for the moonshine
Down for whatever, let's ride, let's ride
These directions say we go to Tucson, Arizona
When we arrive, we'll cop a place we can bunk
And meet my boy in the mornin'
For details and hook-up
You better count your money
Ghetto cowboy
Rise and shine, good mornin'
Howdy, nine o'clock we meet my boy in the saloon in the valley
Now, I done came a long way
And I don't wanna be late
Tell him I'll make it to him 'cause you know we ain't
Move out, giddyup, giddyup, giddyup
You better count your money
Ghetto cowboy
I'm peepin' Krayzie's wanted poster in the saloon
So I assume it'll be trouble around here pretty soon
Glance across the room, I see this youngster getting ready to fight
But if he mess up the night
I think that Krayzie just might take his life
So, I approach him, and I pause
Look, man, I really don't wanna brawl
But won't you chill before them laws come messin' up this master plan?
Since he already rowdy, I just asked the man
Hey, you want some work? Well, partner, put in your bid
And by the way, now what's your name? They call me Layzie the Kid
The name's Powder P, can I get a twelve gauge?
Outlaw, everyday on the front page
Mister Kid, if you give me the lowdown
Me and Black Jack be ready for the showdown
With two double-barrels pointed at whatever
We'll stick together, I'm purty clever
So saddle up, jump on the bandwagon
Because it's all goin' down
I heard a guy run in the bar screamin'
Krayzie's in town
Now when we get to the saloon, you don't worry
Wait outside, and don't be stealin' nobody's damn horses
Step inside the bar
Lay the kid, you son of a gun
Hey, man, I'm glad you made it safely
Now let's go have some fun
And this my partner Powder
He's a young gun
Howdy
Mighty glad to meet ya, son
Oh yeah, you know I also brought a friend along
Meet Thug Queen, the horse peddler
Straggler, just met her
Howdy, partner, already got the horses saddled up
I hope you good at robbin' banks like you rustle that cattle up
Now, y'all, it's gon' be gettin' dark real soon
I think you're right, I say we move c'mon, let's move out
Giddyup, giddyup, giddyup, move out
You better count your money
