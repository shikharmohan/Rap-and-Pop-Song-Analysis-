Pump pump, pump pump, pump pump
Pump pump, pump pump
Let the motion of your body be the key
'Cuz we be the motherfucking G Funk family
Now, I'll play the G in this deadly game
Snoop Dogg is the name, Dogg Pound's the game
If it ain't one thing it's a motherfucking 'nother
Word to my granny and my daddy and my mother
Whether standing on the corner or bouncing in the six-deuce
When I was locked up, I couldn't wait to get loose
'Cuz back in the days, on the side where it's at
A nigga had to have a fat stack
And I was a fool, don't make me have to grab my strap
And go rat-tat-tat-tat, nigga
Slap to a motherfucker face, he fall
Can't none of y'all niggaz see the Doggy Dogg
'Cuz I'm one rude bwoy coming with the wickedness
So shut the fuck up and listen while I'm kicking this
Blam blam, blam to dem all
Listen to the shots from my nigga Doggy Dogg
(Pump pump)
Blam blam, blam to dem all
Listen to the shots from my nigga Doggy Dogg
(Pump pump)
Now you can look to the sun and spot the moon
And see Snoop Doggy Dogg step into the room
With the G funk, he funk, she funk, we funk
Follow me, follow me, listen to the words that a nigga
I come down with the wickedness
One rude bwoy coming with the darkness
(Blam)
Close your eyes 'cuz you can't see me
I quit school cause of recess you fucking B.G.
I'm shaking up the party, like 'Lodi Dodi'
Is he the dopest? Ya betta ask somebody
When then send, some gin
And a pack of zig zags, now let the games begin
In nineteen motherfucking ninety three
I'm fucking up every nigga known in the industry
Check this out, it's a Dogg Pound thang
You know who I am, you know my motherfuckin name, who am I?
(The S N Double O P)
Nickname, last name
(Silky Smooth, D O double G)
The behavior and the flavor that I found
Makes me wanna hit that ass up with the Dogg Pound
Blam blam, blam to dem all
Listen to the shots from my nigga Doggy Dogg
(Pump pump)
Blam blam, blam to dem all
Listen to the shots from my nigga Doggy Dogg
(Pump pump)
Now just back up, don't act up, I pack up much heat
Any battle I'm in, I win, I can't be beat
Don't sleep while I creep, peep out my technique
I forgot, I'm out of sight, so you can't see
The MC of the year, you hear and you fear
I got something for them niggaz in the front and the rear
I handle the sides, did a drive-by in the who-ride
I'm satisfied now everything is really alright
You know when I come, nigga, I come wicked
Don't need no permission, motherfucker, I'ma kick it
Niggaz sweat my shit, I wet 'em up with the biscuit
Lick 'em up shot, it don't stop 'til dem all drop
Make up your mind, go pop or slang rocks
Just stop, rotting on the next niggaz jock
I'm strapped with my glock on your block
And ready to let loose on the first imitator that I spot
Blam blam, blam to dem all
Listen to the shots from my nigga Doggy Dogg
(Pump pump)
Blam blam, blam to dem all
Listen to the shots from my nigga Doggy Dogg
(Pump pump)
