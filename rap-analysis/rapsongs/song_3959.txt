Drink somethin', toast somethin'
So, he can beat the pussy up
Like he stole somethin'
Yeah, y'all know what it is, it's your girl comin' at you
Shot out to all my dope boys in the hood
Huggin' the block till wee hours in the mornin'
Shot out to my sexy girls who know how to put it on
So they lookin'

Get it poppin' all night till like 4 somethin'
And then we right back at it 'round 6 somethin'
It's supposed to be girls night out
So you know he got my girlfriends cursin' me out
Sayin' that I'm whipped and he turnin' me out
No need for the gym 'cause he be workin' me out
For me, he got a huge appetite
Lick my ice cream like a tasty delight
The bond between us is tight
I heard, dude, they poppin' tonight
(What?)
I ain't goin' to the club
No hangin' with my girls
I'm chillin' with ma nigga tonight
R.Kelly got a show but I can't go
I'm chillin' with ma nigga tonight
Victoria Secret lingerie on
Layin' up with my nigga tonight
When we about to get it on
We turn off the phone
It's all about my man, tonight
Yeah, tonight it's just me and my boo
Candle light dinner, sippin' some wine too
Lingerie, see through, you know how I do
Playin' slow jams to set the mood
Some Marvin Gaye, Luther Vandross, a little Anita
In the bed laughin' at Martin and Gina
All eyes on us like Brad and Angelina
No can come between us
(Nope)
The things he do gives me the chills
Like writin' out I love you in 100 dollar bills
He don't even think about playin' the field
He in ecstasy without takin' the pills
He treats me like a queen, I love the way he courts me
Makin' love in the Ferrari he just bought me
Playin' Playstation, Fight Night
I heard stereo poppin' tonight
(What?)
I ain't goin' to the club
No hangin' with my girls
I'm chillin' with ma nigga tonight
R.Kelly got a show but I can't go
I'm chillin' with my nigga tonight
Victoria Secret lingerie on
Layin' up with my nigga tonight
When we about to get it on
We turn off the phone
It's all about my man, tonight
From the bed to the kitchen
To the livin' room and couch
We done blessed every room
In this New York penthouse
Miami estate house by the lake
We ain't watchin' pornos, we watchin' our own sex tape
I caught a Kenny all over his jimmy
So when he stick it in me he drunk off the Kimmy
I make a nigga bust faster then a semi
'Cause Kimmy get the Kenny, rock harder than a penny
Full body massage, champagne, bubble bath
Then we make love on a bed made of cash
He can't get enough, he always ready to smash
He loves how I'm shaped just like a hour glass
This niggas' tight chillin' with his wife
The day don't come before the love of his life
We in the crib havin' a pillow fight
I heard Lodis poppin' tonight
(What?)
I ain't goin' to the club
No hangin' with my girls
I'm chillin' with ma nigga tonight
R.Kelly got a show but I can't go
I'm chillin' with ma nigga tonight
Victoria Secret lingerie on
Layin' up with ma nigga tonight
When we about to get it on
We turn off the phone
It's all about my man tonight
