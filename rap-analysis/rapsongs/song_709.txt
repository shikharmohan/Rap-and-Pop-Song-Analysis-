This one hyah, is a must
Let top selector crush y'all with skill
Cause ya know it's so skillful
Long time for reggae music no hip-hop music
Could take it with said speed
So come.. bust!

You're sleepin and you're creepin with the stardom
First you do the nasty, then he raped me

This should take five seconds
Yo, this is dj kenny parker in the house
I just wanna say peace to my man bizmarkie
Epmd, de la soul, a tribe called quest
Shabba ranks, ice-t over on the west coast
Nice and smooth, gangstarr
And umm kid capri
And yo check out this next beat
Cause it's kinda funky!
