Yo, you got these niggas running around like they head cut off
Like they gully then switch when I'm spittin' those gummies
I creep in the cold till my nose get runny
Then I'm laying for a nigga like I'm waiting on money
I ask these hoes what the fuck they want from me
From the gate I keep it real that's why the gold love me
I got a shorty and she get down for me, when I'm out of town
You know she holdin' down the crown for me
Dog, God forbid if I die, don't worry kid
Take you with me shit put some dope on me
My life's story was the henny, had to stop that
And now I'm focusing clear when I cop that
Fuck getting clapped, it be more like applause
Since they tellin' like broads, might as well be the Mobb
The H da A da V da O da C I'm the man
The myth pushing shit to the white league
You can two face me, backstab me
A nigga still ain't taking what's mines gon' die trying
(I won't fall)
You can try to set me up and all that
A nigga too much on point for all that
(I won't fall)
You can two face me, backstab me
A nigga still ain't taking what's mines gon' die trying
(I won't fall)
You can try to set me up and all that
A nigga too much on point for all that
Don't make me be after you niggas like the Ku Klux Man
Throwin' my hoody, and you know I'm burnin' that grass
Plottin' on how I'm gon' murda that ass
I'm poppin' up, guns choppin' up, yo whole staff
We stoppin' the cassette, ain't nothin' gettin' passed
'Cuz we gettin' fat, on top of that we gettin' cash
I hear you niggas wanna get me may God be with you
Plus you better keep that mothafuckin' thing right wit you
And if I feel you a threat to my well-being
Niggas is bleeding you niggas better back up off the P kid
I blam you, and pass you to Jesus Christ
You be a ghostdog like Forest Whitaker right
Be a dumb mothafucka thinkin' P not squeezin'
Like Palm Springs the only thing beefin'
Is that gumball 'cuz I ain't got talk for ya'll
I got big four-pound towners do you new bounce
You can two face me, backstab me
A nigga still ain't taking what's mines gon' die trying
(I won't fall)
You can try to set me up and all that
A nigga too much on point for all that
(I won't fall)
You can two face me, backstab me
A nigga still ain't taking what's mines gon' die trying
(I won't fall)
You can try to set me up and all that
A nigga too much on point for all that
The two-face niggas
The backstab niggas
I felt that shit coming
Nip that in the bud gunnin'
No tolerance for them niggas
Fuck the dumb shit, I hope you niggas die broke
While we in the plushes
Hotel Suites
Expensive car seats
Windows half-down bumpin' out Mobb Beatz
With a bad bitch beside me
Raisin' up the volume
Know they hate to see that
And that's why we come through
You can two face me, backstab me
A nigga still ain't taking what's mines gon' die trying
(I won't fall)
You can try to set me up and all that
A nigga too much on point for all that
(I won't fall)
You can two face me, backstab me
A nigga still ain't taking what's mines gon' die trying
(I won't fall)
You can try to set me up and all that
A nigga too much on point for all that
I won't fall
