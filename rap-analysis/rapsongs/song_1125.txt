I wanna get closer to you baby, ooh
You have come so far, you've got so far to go
You have come so far, you've got so far to go
Sweetheart, you know that you the most
Important, at least on the West coast, ha
I'm just trippin', there's something 'bout you though
You think different and understand how I flow
Got cribs on both coasts
But I'm a Chicago getter
You get down, but you ain't a gold digger
You got the soul with the figure to match
Your girlfriend said, "Yo that dude is a catch
Creative with the gifts plus he hit it from the back"
In places we ain't supposed to
We makin' music, baby you on the vocals
International lover, I never stay local
Go to places that you've never been
Beautiful outside, even better when it's in
You have arrived girl, you can come again, come on
You have come so far, you've got so far to go
Say it again
You have come so far, you've got so far to go
Hoo, yeah
You sexy, I know brothers try to spit to you
But I'm the only one that could get to you
Liftin' you, my drive is shiftin' you
I opened your freak, it's like a gift to you
I truly and thickly am thankful
Long as I'm in your town I'ma stay faithful
Ha, you know I can't escape you
No matter how far, you're still my star
You was there when Lamar try to steal my car
Snappin' with me, that's just how real you are
Sophisticated woman, you understand a man
You don't call all the time just to see where I am
Put a g in your hand, make sure you're livin' all right
Makin' love is me and I'ma give it all night
Turn over in the mornin', make it warmer and better
Long as we can be, we can come together, come on
You have come so far, you've got so far to go
I don't believe you heard me baby
You have come so far, you've got so far to go
Go on, go on baby
Go on, go on girl
Go on, go on
Go on baby, go on baby
Go on baby, go on baby
Go on
You have come so far, you've got so far to go
Know what I mean baby?
You have come so far, you've got so far to go
You have come so far, you've got so far to go
You have come so far, you've got so far to go
