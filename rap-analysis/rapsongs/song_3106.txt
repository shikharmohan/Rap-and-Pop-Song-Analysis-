Today, how you like me now, I'm in the mix?
It's 1986 and I got the fix with the chicken and a quota
Got the baking soda, let the water boil, workers all loyal
Dropped out the twelveth 'cuz my wealth is shorter
Than a midget on his knees, now, I slang keys
Infest my hood with crack, 'cuz I'm the mack
Take a nation of millions to hold me back
Too big for my britches and I got bitches
Now, I'm hittin' switches, niggas want my riches
Used to get 18 when my G was alive, now a key is 13-5
'89s the number, another summer, police ain't get no dumber
Streets dried up, used to think it would last
But being a king-pin is a thing of the past
They tried to blast me for selling a boulder
Now, I got my ass in Minnesota
Got my own crew, it's on brand new
Damn, what can I do today?
Now, it was on from dusk to dawn
And everything jumped, what the fuck can I do today?
Now, it was on from dusk to dawn
And everything jumped
Already done stack me half a mill ticket
Bought a house next to Prince, so now, I can kick it
Now I got ends, wavin' to my friends, rollin' in my Benz
Goin' to see the Twins
Play at the dome, police are tappin' my mobile phone
I'm almost home, gettin' excited, indited
Spent a grip and a year tryin' to fight it
Lawyer got paid, plea, no contest
And everything I own got repossessed
Now take a look at the dust
And I'm happy 'cuz I only got 36 months
Never picked up a book
But my arms are 16 inches, niggas, look
Can't wait for '92, so I can get with my crew
And see, what can I do today?
Now, it was on from dusk to dawn
And everything jumped
Phucked up in the pen, now it's ninety-fo
Back in LA and I'm bailin' in the dough
Everybody, now I gotta start from scratch
So, where to work at, and niggas smirk at
Me say ain't nuttin' poppin' from here to the L B
What you tell me?
No, it ain't crack, and everybody's jackin' for a coupe
'Cuz they sent in the troops
Even though I got muscle, that ain't my hustle
Takin' niggas shit in a tussle
No skills to pay the bills
Takin' 'bout education to battle inflation
No college degree, just a dumb ass G
Yeah, you Nigga, who me?
I got a baby on the way, damn, it's a mess
Have you ever been convicted of a felony? Yes
Took some advice from my Uncle Fester
All dressed up in polyester
Welcome to McDonalds, may I please help you?
Shit, what can I do today?
Now, it was on from dusk to dawn
And everything jumped
The white man has broke every law
Known to man to establish America
But he'll put you in the state penitentiary
He'll put you in the federal penitentiary for breaking these same laws
Now, we gonna look and see if this muthaphucker is guilty
For the laws he'll put you in jail for drug using, drug selling
Armed robbery, strong armed robbery, grand
Larceny, rape, racketeering, conspiracy to commit murder
Extortion, aggravated assault, mayhem, sodomy of the black man
Trespassing, embezzlement, purgery, kidnapping, smuggling
Grand theft, brandishing a firearm, carrying a concealed weapon
Breaking and entering and premeditated cold-blooded murder
Guilty on every charge
