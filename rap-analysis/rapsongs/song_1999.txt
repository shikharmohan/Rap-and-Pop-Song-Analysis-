They say, "A black man is a pimp", Well let me tell you the biggest pimp
On planet motherfuckin' earth, is her Momma
It's her Momma that told her, "Get a man that got a good job girl
Make sure he got a good car girl"
"Make sure he can take you out and buy you somethin' girl"
What happened to just fallin' in love with a nigga with a bus pass?
Just 'cause you love the nigga, but I'm no pimp motherfucker
I gotta be the player
Biggest hoes, on planet earth
Are walkin' through the motherfuckin' neighborhood
You knew when you got with the nigga he already had a woman
You knew he already had a family but you fucked him anyway
And then when you thought you gon' lose the nigga
You went and got pregnant, didn't you bitch, didn't you?
The ol' keep a nigga baby
And then when the nigga ain't around, what do you tell the child?
"That nigga ain't shit, that's why yo' Daddy ain't here
'Cause that nigga ain't shit"
How 'bout bein' a woman and tellin' the kid the truth
That yo' Momma, you was a hoe, tell the kid
Momma was a hoe, I was weekend pussy
I had you to keep the nigga, it didn't work out
That's why he ain't here but he a good nigga
'Cause he take care of his real family
I was just a dumb bitch tryin' to keep a nigga that I wanted
