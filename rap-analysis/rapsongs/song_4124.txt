Goddamn, missed and hit a nigga in his head with dis one
I'ma paint da city red wit dis one
I'm ahead wit dis one
See u fuckin' wit da boys
Who tote toys way before Christmas
No assistance just
That persistence with
That commitment if
I don't get it, somebody gon' die tonight
I know my vibe is tight
And I deserve da throne
And if da kid ain't right
Den let me die in his songs
See I'll be ridin' just
Ridin alone'
Wit my daddy on my mind, like u gotta be kiddin'
How da hell u ain't here 2 see ya prince do his thing?
Sometimes I wanna drop a tear but no emotions from a king
Shant be, so I be who I be, that's me
Dats Weezy F. Baby and
Please say da motherfuckin'
So I be who I be, that's me
Dats Weezy F. Baby and
Please say da motherfuckin'
Baby u gotta kno dat I'm just out here
Doin' what I gotta do 4 me and u and we eatin'
So bitch, how da fuck iz u trippin'?
I'm takin' dese chances
My head 2 da sky
My feet on da ground
My fingas 2 da judge
If da money don't move
Then I won't budge
(Won't budge)
No I won't budge, no Lord
Money iz da motivation
Facin' da avenue
Back touchin' da wall
Got da weed, got da gun
Gotta run when I hear da bird call
Dang, hop in dat thang and merk off
Swerve off
U kno me dey call me Birdman Jr.
Anybody murderer
If Birdman sponsor it
Phantom of da Opera
All black, guap tent, locked in
I can let them shots out
U can't get no shots in
Bullet proof, leave a nigga wit a bullet roof
Shoot ya in ya mouth, Leroy
They call 'em Bullet Tooth
I'm like, what it do, what it do
There's a full court pressure
I'm just going for da 2
If I'm open for da 3
I'ma take it in a second
Even if there's one second
I'ma make it, it's nothin'
I don't take it for granted
I don't take it for nothin'
I take it for what it's worth
To da derf motherfucker
(Yea)
Baby u gotta kno dat I'm just out here
Doin' what I gotta do 4 me and u and we eatin'

And I promise if u try me
He gon' have to rewind dis track
And make me go back

Dat boy will lay flat, so flat
Dat act is wat I perform amongst u hatas
Got Nina in my palm and I'm masturbating
Black Peter Pan, fly till I die, what u sayin'?

Got me feelin' like Scarface
Light da Cohiba, streets reply

Get right in the 4 seater, top floor of da Four Seasons

And look I got some
And only one know how to bag, bitch bundle up
See it's a cold world so homie bundle up
We ain't on dis grind for nothin'
Now get ya hustle up
Baby u gotta kno dat I'm just out here
