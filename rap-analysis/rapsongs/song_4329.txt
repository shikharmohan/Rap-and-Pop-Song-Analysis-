Whats poppin?!
Me, Im good, figured Id update my glorious fans again. Better sooner than later right? Ill try to do this more frequently.
Well aint nothing going on in here but the time, which seems like its taking forever. Im trying to make the most out of every second tho, mentally. Theres some pretty cool people in here. Even though this isnt a cool place to be. Ive learned plenty already and the best lesson is to not come back. Last night, I kicked ass in UNO! Anyway, thats neither here nor there. Just thought Id let yall know. Gotta stay hydrated. Though its hot, I still work out. Now dont be expecting me to look like Hercules when I get out, but I should be a little bulky. I guess. Anyways, please remember to always check for your name in the thank yous. Im always reading letters and responding. Off the subject but Chris, I think you should team up with Kobe! Go Lakers! Hey Lindsey, glad it
