Yes, indeedy sho' 'nuff needy
I got the feeling to stretch on out
My children are cryin', my elders are dying
And me I'm relying on a check for rent
If I gotta be broke, then ain't no joke
I'm moving to the country and buying some land
And I'll be alright if I can rest at night
Knowing my children got land to stand on
Ache'n for acres plenty of acres
Money spent in rent ain't earning me cent
Ain't gettin' no Caddy, no Benz, no Jeep
Until I got some and for some land to keep
No more children crying instead they'll be running
Running free and wild in the heat of the sun
'Cuz once I'm gone I wanna feel strong
That my children will go on, family land and all sayin'
I got some land to stand on, no more ache'n for acres
No beggin' for leftovers, got some space of my own
I got grounds to raise on, no more ache'n for acres
No more giving to takers, got some land to leave on
No more elders passin' without my kids askin'
Papa who's tombstones are those in the yard
Family gotta stay close all of us gotta stay close
Ache'n for acres for buildin' a nation
Ain't about depending on government spendin'
Especially when the government's got a plan of their own
Separate from me, separate from you
Separate from most, in sync with a few
Ache'n for acres plenty of acres
My grandpappa had 'em all but he lost 'em and he sold 'em
The cities were a growin' and grandpa's getting older
Little did he know that his land was valuable
Got land to stand on then you can stand up
Stand up for your rights as a woman, as a man
Man o' man my choices expand
Ain't got me no money but I got me some land
I got some land to stand on, no more ache'n for acres
No beggin' for leftovers, got some space of my own
I got grounds to raise on, no more ache'n for acres
No more giving to takers, got some land to leave on, yeah
