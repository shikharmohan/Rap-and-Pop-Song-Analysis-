"Do you believe?"
"I believe"
In time, in time
In time this rhyme'll be more than just a fantasy
A Black man'll be the man to claim Presidency
Is it hard to see?
So try to see as i see
In time i see a better Black reality
It took one man to open the door, yep!
He let in one million more
And i don't think that this country knows
What the hell that it's in for
A Black reign, to tough to tame (to tame)
Enough to blow the other man's brain (man's brain)
Things just won't be the same (the same)
It's gonna be a whole new game (a whole new game)
New lessons will be taught
Meaningless fights will not be fought
An attempt to save some lives
Spreading out more peaceful vibes
See that less drugs will be sold
So a man can live to grow old
Instead of being left in the cold to rot
'Cause he got stopped by a small white rock
I hope in time things change
And that i'm around to see that stage
In time my brother
In time my brother
In time my brother
In time
Bible in the closet collecting dust (dust)
Mama on crack, now who ya gonna trust (trust)
Daddy, daddy drinking that Vodka and Rum (rum)
Guzzling down that One Fifty One (One!)
Churchless people are running too (Two!)
Preparing themselves for the second coming (Three!)
Sign of the times i see some (see some)
Angels in the sky, (look!) i wanna be one
Living in darkness, find the light (light)
Afraid to play this record 'cause you fear the truth (truth)
I know that you know you aint living right (right)
The holy scriptures provide the proof (proof)
Below the heavens and above sea level (level)
In time my brother, I'm trying ta tell ya
In time my brother, In time 
In time my brother, In time
Everybody thinks Q-Tip is odd
'Cause holy, holy Q-Tip speaks of God
The changes of time arranges a rhyme
Rhymers (?) like Aarons rod
You can care less about what i'm saying
So i'll pray for you when i start praying
I'm a sinner, you're a sinner
Get off the bandwagon and repent your sins
I don't wanna push my beliefs on you
But you think about it and see if it's true
I'm telling you, Do what ya do
See if ya last for the broadcast
'Cause it's on the way
Preachers preach about us almost every day
These bag-a-bon(?) shoes are longing to stray
But i'm a bag-a-bag-bon(?)
'Cause i won't pay
Clock that clock, I'm clocking mine
Better watch out, it's coming in time
In time (In time)
In time my brother In time (in time)
In time my brother In time (in time)
In time my brother In time (in time)
I said
In time my brother In time 
In time my brother In time
In time my brother In time
In time my brother In time
