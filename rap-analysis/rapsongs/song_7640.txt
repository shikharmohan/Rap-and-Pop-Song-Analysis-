[Intro]
[Chorus:]
I Said The Game The Game Yea It's Over It's Over
And Don't Forget To Tell 'Em That I Told Ya
I Said The Game The Game Yea It's Over It's Over
And Don't Forget To Tell 'Em That I Told Ya
[Verse 1:]
Said I'm Going in Shawty I Got This Little Niggas
I'm Lighting Mama Babys Daddy I'm Doubt These Little Niggas
Still Acting Like They In Or Out These Little Niggas
I Survived Many Magic In My House These Little Niggas
See I Ain't Tryin To Brag I Ain't Tryin To Boast
And Since We Talking That Guess Who Sold The Most
Yea Damn Right Not Even Close
I'm The Type Of Nigga To Re-Up Could Buy A Boat
And When I Say Boat Just So I Meant A Yacht
We Talking About Those Cars Just Know That I Got Alot
Yea No Nigga Just Know I Got A Alot
I'm A Trampolince Nigga Just Know I Flip Before I Flop
[Chorus:]
I Said The Game The Game Yea It's Over It's Over
And Don't Forget To Tell 'Em That I Told Ya
I Said The Game The Game Yea It's Over It's Over
And Don't Forget To Tell 'Em That I Told Ya
[Verse 2:]
They Ask Me Why Do I Never Stress Cause I'm The Best
Hello World You're Rocking With Young So Fuck The Rest
My Aunty Mother Let Me Borrow A Kiss And I Never Miss ?
She Always Used To Clean Up Behind Me Love Her To Death
I Used Too Busy Off On The Block With The Crackheads
I Rather Do That Then Sleep In A Packed Bed
Talking About So Much Pee Stains Wish I Was Dead
Wish I Could Sleep Aside This Bitch Wish I Was Ten
You Don't Know That My Nigga I'm Bumpin That Slick Daddy
Thinking How Could Get My Son The Rich Daddy
I Could Sell Me Some Dope I'm Writing Some Dope Thrines
And That's How You Kill Some Birds With One Dime
[Chorus:]
I Said The Game The Game Yea It's Over It's Over
And Don't Forget To Tell 'Em That I Told Ya
I Said The Game The Game Yea It's Over It's Over
And Don't Forget To Tell 'Em That I Told Ya
[Verse 3:]
I'm in The A-Town Fitted That's Blue With The Red Benz
I'm a Holla TIPs With Me Just And Him Just Us In The Black ?
I Got Them Martin Lawerence Stones In My Ear Them Bring 'em Streets
Last Time I Looked Down I Was Buyig For Two Weeks
I Was Once The MVP In The Triple Beam Team
And Push The Lamborghini That's Listerine Green
What The Fresh That Bitch Was Clean
Mustve Sucked From A Little PMS That Bitch Was Mean
[Chorus:]
I Said The Game The Game Yea It's Over It's Over
And Don't Forget To Tell 'Em That I Told Ya
I Said The Game The Game Yea It's Over It's Over
And Don't Forget To Tell 'Em That I Told Ya
Let's GO!
