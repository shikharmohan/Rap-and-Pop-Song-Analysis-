Sexy noises turn me on and on 
Talk to me and you can't go wrong 
I love the sound of your voice when you make love to me 
And you caress my lips with your tongue

Love it when you whisper down my ears (oooo baby) 
Love it when you breathin' down me face (oooo baby) 
Love it when you rub down me spine (oooo baby) 
Love it when we drink white wine (oooo baby)

Do anything you like, and do it just how you like it 
But when you feel you wanna scream, baby, don't fight it

You're gonna feel the rotation in my hips

And don't stop the lyrics if you don't wanna lose me 
Because I wanna know, lover, if I'm doin' it well 
But if you don't yell, brother, how can I tell?
