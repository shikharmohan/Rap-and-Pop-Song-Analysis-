Let me tell ya a little story 'bout my homeboy Ed
Use to drink every day, straight 40's to the head
You try to snap on him, he'd ask what you said
You still try to break, he'd start given up lead
Love to gamble on one knee he stayed
Tryin' to hit seven on one knee he played
Worked tees and weights so he always got paid
Blew on the hoes every dollar he made
Crazy friends, crazy friends he had
Superfly drobe, super dope pad
Cars for your ass and I'm talkin' 'bout class
Benz's and better with his name on the dash
One night he got drunk and started drivin' real fast
Ed's dead
