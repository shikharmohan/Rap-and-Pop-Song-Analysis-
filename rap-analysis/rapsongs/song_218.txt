Nigga that watch is nice

Make money, make money, money, money
Nigga if you ask me, it's the only way
Take money, take money, money, money
You wanna spray at me? Go head, the last nigga that tried
Got hit, keeled over and bled 'til he died
Ya little sister callin' you stupid, reason why?
Her and ya momma in the livin' room now hog tied
I came up wit two new ways to get rich I can't wait
Got a brand new cig and that old thirty eight
I be schemin' to put a lil' bread on my plate
Watchin' Dre serve skunk through the hole in the gate
I stick a nigga for his shine sell 'em back the next day
You thought I really wanted ya pussy bitch please
This is stash house, jack pot, leave her them keys
My black G unit hoody just reak of Marijuana
Cocaine comin' out my pores in the sauna
I'm serious man I'm so sincere
This the flow right here that fucked up Jeffery's career
Make money, take money, yeah nigga yeah
Nigga that watch is nice
That's what you bought from me
That chain is nice
That's what you bought from me
Them earrings is nice
That's what you bought from me
Take that shit off, move I'll break you off properly
I get mine the fast way, ski mask way
Make money, make money, money, money
Nigga if you ask me, it's the only way
Take money, take money, money, money
Who's dat peepin' in my window, wow
The Feds on me now, they know when I'm sleepin'
They know when I'm wake
I know they got my phone taped I'm screamin' fuck Jake
I'm tryin to stay out them pens, so I switched states
Bad news V A now that sounds great
I see niggas wit that ice on, rims shined up
This towns one big pussy waitin' to get fucked
I holla at A I peoples to get gats
They charged me 500 a piece for two macs
Then I'm back doin' me, I'm back out on a spree
Catch me n' niggas slippin' out pumpin' dat D
Give me a lil' crew I'll have 'em pumpin' for me
The more product I take the more paper we see
Change my name in N Y they don't know where I be
Yeah, a nigga doin' dirt but a nigga low key
Nigga that watch is nice
That's what you bought from me
That chain is nice
That's what you bought from me
Them earrings is nice
That's what you bought from me
Take that shit off, move I'll break you off properly
