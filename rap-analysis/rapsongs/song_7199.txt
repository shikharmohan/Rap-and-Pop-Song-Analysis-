Hit me on the hipper anytime, I don't mind
Why y'all niggas bitchin' on and whinin' I'm a grind
Shack it in the winter and the summer I'm a shine, gettin' mine
It's plenty of money to be made from Candler Road to Bankhead
It's plenty of room to get paid for those that ain't scared
I got the hard for the j's and dro' for the dank heads
The dope game still strong like pimpin' ain't dead
Heard what I said I ain't buyin' no yell
Weighin' 36 O's or more on a triple beam scale

Standin' round in my trapp I think you fuckin' up shawty

Get a quarter ki and cut it down to all dimes
Buy my own blow so the profits all mine
How we gone shine? The same way we gone grind
Niggas ain't gone be able to see us hey, they gone think they gone blind
C got choppers on his vert and I got daden's on mine
Triple gold and vogues, poppin' moe', blowin' pine
Honey brown wood grain' wheel in the 'lac
Oak on the dash and the 12's in the back
Came for years of trappin', stayin' down wit the crack
Now that I made it rappin' I ain't never goin' back
I'ma let the paper stack till it can't no more
Still got love for my niggas slangin' blow, gettin' do' fo' sure

Nann nigga barred we the trillest niggas livin'
If this ain't yo trapp then what the fuck you doin' in it?
What the muthafuckin' business, do you think you puttin' down?
If so then my corner you need to get the fuck from round
Unless you wanna sell some weed my nigga Beed got the pound
Anythin' else I don't need ya help, I got the hard locked down
37's ki's in da grill of the broam
Jumped from 33 to my folk in Boyd homes
All most gone ain't got but four mo'
Eternal Simpson Road ain't no more blow
Nothin' left for you but to count my do'
Just somethin' else to do while I blow my dro'

Gettin' rich in this bitch
