Spit that venom, pretty thick bitches walk by
If you let them pussy printin' through they denim
Take her for a ride around the block, let her enjoy the whip
Drop her off, let her walk the strip
Ain't it funny how nature work?
Make bitches wanna bounce on a nigga
Until they make it hurt

Throw yo' pussy 'til you make it hurt
Pop that shit until you make it hurt

Let go before you make a nigga
Wanna let the tec blow
Bitches dancin' like a stepshow, nigga
Violate nigga, you gets no love, ghetto

Whylin' like a bunch of lesbo bitches
The best show of bitches, so electro bitches, c'mon
Get on your mark, get ready set go bitches
Then we go and add a little propane to it

And make bitches wanna get ass-naked, c'mon
