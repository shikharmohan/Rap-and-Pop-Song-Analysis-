I got a part to play, we going hard these days
Fuck the harder way, we're doing it the smarter way
To my God I pray, that's how I start my day
The bullets starts to spray the revolution starts today
I say the shit these people ain't got the heart to say
Fuck the harder way, we doing it the smarter way
To my God I pray, that's how I start my day
The bullets starts to spray the revolution starts today
You say you never scared there's kids in other countries
Making jerseys, jeans, and sneakers they could never wear
Parents never there, they're busy building homes
They can't afford to buy, cars they can't afford to drive
Working jobs that don't support their life
You busy screaming gangsta, gangsta all that talk is strife
You already know lost the fight if you don't know the cost of life
These kids is forced to fight a war they can't outrun
Ain't got no shoes but got a gun
Now where the fuck he pulled that out from?
People ask me how we wearing diamonds
When there's little kids in Sierra Leone
Losing arms for crying while they mining
Probably an orphan who's momma died of aids
He built a coffin working often but he never paid
Forever slaving in the world that's forever cold
Becoming the man of the house at 11 years old
This reality rap, I get inside the mentality that
Terrorize you like a cowardly act
I got a part to play, we going hard these days
Fuck the harder way, we're doing it the smarter way
To my God I pray, that's how I start my day
The bullets starts to spray the revolution starts today
I say the shit these people ain't got the heart to say
Fuck the harder way, we doing it the smarter way
To my God I pray, that's how I start my day
The bullets starts to spray the revolution starts today
I was sold to a sick European by a rich African battlin'
Middle passages, I can't go back again
Battlin' years of denied history, lies and mysteries
Wives with misty eyes watchin' their husbands be beaten viciously
Battle in the wilderness of North America
Run by the river, only stoppin' to pray chased by predators
Terrorists with etiquette who vote and kill their president
Their capacity for evil so evident and prevalent
Ain't no hesitation involved, a nation dissolved
While we sit back waitin' to evolve
Those who would trade in their freedom
For their protection deserve neither
Not a name, not tradition
Religion, you learn Jesus, turn the other cheek
Inherit the earth, just stay meek, fuck the way you speak
Try to run, we chop off your feet, fast forward to 2004 we selling
Yo this ain't what I'm settling for, I want more, yo
I got a part to play, we going hard these days
Fuck the harder way, we're doing it the smarter way
To my God I pray, that's how I start my day
The bullets starts to spray the revolution starts today
I say the shit these people ain't got the heart to say
Fuck the harder way, we doing it the smarter way
To my God I pray, that's how I start my day
The bullets starts to spray the revolution starts today
