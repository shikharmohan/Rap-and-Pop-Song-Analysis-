Acting like you don't see the dollar signs in her eyes
She wants her nails done, and her hair too
Plus a diamond necklace, that's all on you

If you do it homeboy, man, I couldn't be it
Hypnotized by her good looks?

Mil around your neck, mil around your arms
A championship ring, she must be a bowla hard
She turns on the leader, as soon as you need her
Once you bite the bait, you look mighty thico
When money talks, she ticks like F.B.I
Ready to handcuff the right guy
Look you in the eye, and tell a boldface lie
Scheming on the way to money, yo, well ya tried
Guess it's a game now, gotta watch who you trust
Like her because, it's only out for your books
Ye sir, she's all about being paid
