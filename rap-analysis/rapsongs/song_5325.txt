Say what, say what?
Say what, say what?
Say what, say what?
Missy, bring it in
Why you played on me? Wasn't I good enough for you?
All those other girls you've been with can't do like I do
Gave you all my dough when you needed it all the time
And if you planning on leavin' me again, then give me a sign
Beep me 911 or call me on my cell phone
I'll call you back to see what you gon' tell me
You don't wanna date, no if's ands or waits
It's over, babe
Beep me 911 or call me on my cell phone
I'll call you back to see what you gon' tell me
You don't wanna date, no if's ands or waits
It's over, babe
Why you cheatin' on me? Can you tell me what I've done?
I thought you was the one but you just a hit and run
Gave up clubs and parties, I put them aside
Left me in the dark with no kind of sign
Beep me 911 or call me on my cell phone
I'll call you back to see what you gon' tell me
You don't wanna date, no if's ands or waits
It's over, babe
Beep me 911 or call me on my cell phone
I'll call you back to see what you gon' tell me
You don't wanna date, no if's ands or waits
It's over, babe
All my friends say I can do better than you
Maybe, they was right 'cause I feel like a fool
But I can't let you go until you take some time
To tell me why you left me without a goddamn sign
Beep me 911 or call me on my cell phone
I'll call you back to see what you gon' tell me
You don't wanna date, no if's ands or waits
It's over, babe
Beep me 911 or call me on my cell phone
I'll call you back to see what you gon' tell me
You don't wanna date, no if's ands or waits
It's over, babe
Magoo, magoo
Type of nigga' made built to last
Look homegirl, I pump like gas wind
Get ya friend and ya girl and them
My sex drive workout like a gym can
Was the girl that I used to hit
You the girl that I got to quit
See the kitty cat, gotta gold it like a light
In the night, you the freak I'm out with, don't bite
No diggity, who took you out
No doubt when I first got down, made the bro' shout
Look out, make it live, dip and dive, stayin' alive
Shoot me sugar, there it is
Now we talkin' square biz
I'm leaving you without a reason
What I steal but a kiss
What you think, I'm hen pecked?
Girl, get yo mind checked
Take the time, recollect
I just gave you disrespect
Ah, like that, like that
Beep me 911, baby
Say what? Say what?
Misdemeanor, 702
What cha'all gonna do, fellas?
Don't beep them 911
Don't beep them 911
Don't beep them 911
