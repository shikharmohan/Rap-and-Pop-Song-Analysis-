How we stop the Black Panthers?
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer, you hear that?
What Gil Scott is "Heron"
When our heroes and heroines got hooked on heroin
Crack raised the murder rate in DC and Maryland
We, invested in that, it's like we got Merril-Lynched
And we been hangin' from the same tree ever since
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
So we cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it, sell it
The fiends cop it, nowadays they can't tell if
That's that good shit, we ain't sure, man
Put the CD on your toungue, yeah, that's pure, man
That's that crack music, nigga
That real black music, nigga
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la
That's that crack music, nigga

From the place where the father's gone
The mothers is hardly home
And the madigon's lock us up in the Audy Home
How the Mexicans say, we just tryin' to party homes
They wanna pack us all in a box like styrofoam
Who gave Saddam anthrax? George Bush got the answers
Back in the hood, it's a different type of chemical
Arm and Hammer, baking soda raised they own quota
Right when our soldiers ran for the stove 'cause
'Cause dreams of being Hova went from bein' a brokeman
To bein' a dopeman, to bein' a president, look there's hope, man
This that inspiration for the mos and the folks, man
Shorty, come and see if mama straight overdosin'
And this is the soundtrack
This the type of music you make when you 'round that
Crack music nigga
That real black music nigga
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la
That's that crack music, nigga
That real black music, nigga
La la la la la la la la

Our Father, give us this day our daily bread
Before the feds give us these days and take our daily bread
See, I done did all this ol' bullshit
And to atone I throw a little somethin', somethin' on the pulpit
We took that shit, measured it and then cooked that shit
And what we gave back was crack music
And now we ooze it through they nooks and crannies
So our mammas ain't got to be they cooks and nannies
And we gonna repo everything they ever took from grammy
Now the former slaves trade hooks for Grammy's
This dark diction has become America's addiction
Those who ain't even black use it
We gon keep backin' up this here, crack music
