Gotta cut the music up, man
Gotta cut the music up, man
I'm-I'm-I'm Mi-Mi-Missy, radio play me all the time
Write my own rhymes and I swear I'm fly
This flow here form eighty-three
From A to Z ,you can't fuck with me
Me and Timbaland, man, I'll be damn
Remember when Lyte was in love wit Sam
I used to be in love wit this guy name Sam
But to me oh my gosh he was one in a million
I came through 'cause I rock the show
Wack MC's get kicked in the throat
Keep on sleepin' 'cause you think I'm a joke
(Let it bump)
I'm Missy
I'm-I'm-I'm Missy
  (Let it bump)
  (Let it bump)
I'm Missy
I'm Missy on the microphone
I'm I'm Missy
I'm-I'm-I'm Missy
  (Let it bump)
  (Let it bump)
I'm Missy
I'm Missy on the microphone
I'm Missy on the microphone
I'm stupid fresh that's the shit I'm on, come on
Sucker MC's come new in the game
Swear ya hip-hop you just a new jack swing
Remember when Shantay was live on stage
Shantay was live on stage
Let me back that shit up for ya, for ya no hip-hoppers
I'm Missy on the microphone
I'm stupid fresh that's the shit I'm on
Sucker MC's come new in the game
Swear ya hip-hop but don't know Daddy Kane
This time Missy rhyme crazy though
Haters wanna know my antidote
Try to catch up 'cause ya mind is slow
  (Let it bump)
I'm Missy
  (Let it bump)
I'm Missy
  (Let it bump)
I'm Missy
I'm Missy on the microphone
I'm Missy
I'm-I'm-I'm Missy
  (Let it bump)
  (Let it bump)
I'm Missy
I'm Missy on the microphone
Me and Timba-Timba-Timba-Timba Timbaland
Me and Timbaland, man, I'll be damn
(Cut, cut, cut-cu-cu, cut the music up, man)
(Cut, cut, cut-cu-cu, cut the music up, man)
Me and Missy come fresh on tracks
Five albums deep can ya handle that
We came from the basement to platinum plaques
We sittin' on something this black on black
Jimmy Dean, he's the engineer
A nigga been down for about ten years
Fixin' that stuff to make it sound so clear
  (Let it bump)
I'm Missy
  (Let it bump)
I'm Missy
  (Let it bump)
I'm Missy
I'm Missy on the microphone
I'm Missy
I'm-I'm-I'm Missy
  (Let it bump)
  (Let it bump)
I'm Missy
I'm Missy on the microphone
