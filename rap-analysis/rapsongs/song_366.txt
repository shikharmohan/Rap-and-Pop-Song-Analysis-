Settin' it off lettin' it off (whatever)   (x4)

(let 'em have it)
Verse 1:
A-yo I'm serious I'm not the type to joke a lot
Dressed in all black never seen in polka dots
No other writes rhymes like these
I'm cool as a light breeze
I'm playin' rappers out like striped lees
Smoother than velvet
My lyrics are well writ
You sayin' l's this and l's that
Get off l dick
I don't roll with punks I only roll with live guys
And we do drivebys in 325 i's
I had beef with this thief named randolph
Now he's in a casket dressed up with his hands crossed
So you better leave l alone
Before I reach out and touch you but not with a telephone
Yo I'm the brother that you never even thought of beatin'
Black white or puerto rican
I'm gonna slaughter each and
Every crab mc that runs up
When a battle comes up
Give me two thumbs up
Hook
Verse 2:
I damage all opponents as soon as the bell rings
Yo it's all about me it's a b. i. g. l thing
The crown is still mine cause I drop ill rhymes
A lot of rappers talk that murder shit and couldn't kill time
One two one two crews I run through
Fuck karate big l practice gun fu
Cause I'm a mc assassinator
I grab a mag and leave a nag leakin' like activator
Step to this and get shanked up
I knocked out so many teeth the tooth fairy went bankrupt
And I entertain well because of my brain cells
I'm naughty and stop callin' me shorty my name's l
Where raps are hotter than old  ? 
Mcs be talkin' about breakin' jaws when they couldn't break a promise
With big l you can't swing long
So get behind me and sing cause every hero got a theme song
Hook
Verse 3:
The big l's back to attack with a phat rap
Matter of fact black I'm puttin' harlem on the map
What's up cause I'm a stiggy star
Breakin' 'em up and then talkin' they heart
You better believe that big l is the man that be rippin' microphones apart
I'm undefeated that's the stone truth
Cause battlin' me is like fightin' a gorilla in a phone booth
I take lives with no pride
I just committed a homicide
A punk brother died cause he tried
To take my cash but he didn't last
I pulled out fast
I tried to bash then I blast on his monkey ass (boom)
I make a lot of doe
I'm quick to spot a foe
Even if my grandma violate she gotta go
When I was young I played with guns not a kiddy toy
Cause I'm a ruff rugged gangsta not a pretty boy
Facts on tracks I recite well
Everybody be like mike but mike wanna be like l
Hook
Big l outro:
A-yo big shots to all them niggas on the corner
Doin' something they ain't got no business doin'
I gotta say what's up to s&s;, doo wop, and the bounce squad
Can't forget my peeps from brooklyn youknowhati'msayin'? 
Like box and herb and big sid
A-yo l you must be buggin' b
You didn't even let me say what's up to my hoes b
Big l:
Oh yeah we gotta say what's up to the hoes man
Word up let's go see our p.o.
