Yeah
Too fast, you movin' too quick
You heavy on the gas, you movin' too swift
Can't keep up the pace
Might not finish the race
But do it now for it's too late to switch
And how you make a impala lift
But the set card is ya heart
And is hard to be fixed
You gon break it if you don't downshift
And I know you get a rush when you hang around risk
But you gon get enough when you breakin' down sick
All ill can't move your wheels and feelin' like shh
Just a mile back you was feelin' quite brisk
Now you sittin' on bricks, wit ya car on strict
Radio gone, insurance won't cover
Paint job wreck and you draggin' your muffler
Wouldn't listen then, but I bet you hear now
Cuz you gotta speed ticket cuz you wouldn't slow down
Yeeeah
[Kanye West]
Hold up, born in 88
How old is that?
Old enough
I got seniority with the sorority
So, that explains why I love college
Getting brain in the library cuz I love knowledge
When you used your Medulla Oblongata
And give me scoliosis until I comatose'st
And do while I'm sleep, yeah a lil Osmosis
And that's my commandment, you ain't gotta ask Moses
More champagne, more toast'st
More damn planes, more coasts'st
And fuck the bus, the Benz is parked like Rosa(osa)
[Kid Cudi]
Ay I mean stand like a craaper cuz you gotta beep her
I mean prime might be sayin you ain't joggin either
But man ol' girl gotta fat ol' ass
Yeah the type to make you tell "bitch just dance"
And fuck them otha niggas cuz you down for the bitches
And fuck them otha niggas cuz she down for the stickin
And fuck them otha niggas cuz hope she down for some lickin
And fuck them otha bitches cuz she down for the trickin
I'm hoping she a rider
When it's said and done will she spit it up and swallow nooow
I ain't got trip bout them niggas who like her
Cuz me and mommy know, could really make her go
