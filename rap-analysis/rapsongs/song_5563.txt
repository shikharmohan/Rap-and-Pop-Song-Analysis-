Bitch ass nigga, yo it's time to pull the trigga
I might be small, but fuck with bein' bigga
Niggaz wanna throw with that bullshit but step aside
Pull out the four-five, and kill him motherfuckin' dead
Pump his ass with lead
Never fakin' moves, motherfucker run the jewels
Buckwild, blowin' niggaz out the frame
Matter fact, don't call me shorty, kid you know my name
So next time, you see me, you better duck me
'Cause, I don't give a fuck G
Catch wreck with the tec then I'm out like quick sex
Who's next, bitch ass nigga?
Bitch ass nigga, nah you don't want none
Bitch ass nigga, nah you don't want none
Bitch ass nigga, nah you don't want none
Bitch ass nigga, nah you don't want none
Bitch ass
Kick it when I'm wicked and all smoked out
The little nigga that gets on your nerves so read about
You say yo shorty trauma, what's all the drama?
I shoot 'em up like their last name was Farmer
Shorty got the death wish, I wish to die
But when I try, it just goes by
You couldn't kill me because I can't kill myself
And if I got beef then I got it for self
And if I catch a body, I catch it for self
To me, murder is good for the health
Little man paranoid, Mr. Schizophrenic
Thirty-five niggaz wanna funk, don't panic
Just shoot a head up, or take your beatin' like a man
Or pull a burner if you want a longer lifespan
That's how I see it if I gotta die so be it
But maybe one day, my luck'll run out though
Until then, I couldn't give a fuck yo
Little shorty one time, I'm goin' all out for mines
'Cause, there won't be a next time
So what you wanna do punk, back up a little
Gimme some space, I'm hittin' hearts, street sweeper
A little crazed nigga from the streets
Raised in the ghetto, I'm puttin out heads yo
I'm open, time to catch wreck, put 'em in check
Snap his neck, grab his loot then jet
Who's next to be a victim, easily ripped up
Get ready to run when I ripped 'em
Drop to the floor, feel the wrath of the drug war
Call me a thug who gets buck when I want more
Maniac react with a Tech 9
Hit me up now 'cause there won't be a next time
Nah you don't want none
Bitch ass nigga, nah you don't want none
Bitch ass nigga, nah you don't want none
Bitch ass nigga, nah you don't want none
Bitch ass nigga, nah you don't want none
Bitch ass nigga, nah you don't want none
Bitch ass
Who's that nigga standin' with the jewels?
Throw on my hood, cock back the tool
Just to get a rep, yea you goddamn right
Just lick, lick shots 'cause I don't fuck with fights
Back on the ave, and five, oh arrive
Chalk on the ground where the motherfucker died
Niggaz know who did it but ain't nobody snitchin'
No word of to myself, if they do, I'm flippin' the script
Settin' it off, yo, put 'em in a dopefiend
And cut 'em up like protein
The Lord of criminal juvenile crimes committed
Set it some bitch ass nigga, I'm widdit
You couldn't fuck with the skills of the Five Foot
And all it takes is a set to get your crew shook
You're fucked up, kid your rap styles sucks
I'm bustin' niggaz, like my first nut
Should I pull the trigga, huh, no question
Bitch ass nigga, nah you don't want none
Bitch ass nigga, nah you don't want none
Bitch ass nigga, nah you don't want none
Bitch ass nigga, nah you don't want none
Bitch ass nigga, nah you don't want none
Bitch ass nigga, nah you don't want none
Bitch ass nigga, nah you don't want none
Bitch ass nigga, nah you don't want none
Bitch ass nigga
