Yeah, press the start button
Tell these hoes to press the start button
Punch in your code and press the start button
And let the motherfuckin' games begin bitch!
For anyone of these flows just press the start button
Tell my foes to press the start button
For a ludicrous show, just press the start button
And let the motherfuckin' games begin bitch!
Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Eyes low 'cause Igloo done rolled the perfect swisha
Hit you with the weaponry, tell your soldiers to back down
I'm Raw like W.E., you'll get Smackdown!
How you want it?
I clobber my opponents like Blanka
Boy, you Street Fightin' with a monsta
A-Town mobsta, blowin' smoke like Rastas
Pullin' out guns like in Contra
Mo' toys than Tonka
I'm a fuckin' problem, rob 'em
It's Grand Theft Auto, his burner's right beside him
Hollow points headed to your dome
Hollow points headed to your home
Your head of lettuce shredded from the chrome
It's ludicrous parents think I'm a weirdo
I'm a God of War, you a Guitar Hero
Let's box like Tyson, you'll get Punched Out!
Welcome to Luda's world, now bring the blunts out!
Yeah, press the start button
Tell these hoes to press the start button
Punch in your code and press the start button
And let the motherfuckin' games begin bitch!
For anyone of these flows just press the start button
Tell my foes to press the start button
For a ludicrous show, just press the start button
And let the motherfuckin' games begin bitch!
I'm liver than NBA, Luda's Super like Mario
That Playstation 4 shit, you older than Atari, hoe!
Flows that'll make MCs Go! like Diego
Call me the Master Chief, my life is like Halo
Fightin' off haters, I'm the best, ask Khaled
I'm at the Call of Duty plus my Metal Gear Solid
My Resident is Evil, full of Southside riders
I hope your Pac-Man, I got 6 Virtua Fighters
That'll Blitz ya like Madden '09
Or hit you with the Mac and four 9's
Then later sit back and blow pine like it's somethin' to do
It ain't pretty, the Final Fantasy, they think they livin' SimCity
But I'm a MechWarrior, try me and I'll damage ya
Holdin' a Soul Calibur or shoot you like Galaga
Have my Creed Assassin' ya
So clear the room before the shotgun helps you meet your Ultimate Doom
Yeah, press the start button
Tell these hoes to press the start button
Punch in your code and press the start button
And let the motherfuckin' games begin bitch!
For anyone of these flows just press the start button
Tell my foes to press the start button
For a ludicrous show, just press the start button
And let the motherfuckin' games begin bitch!
Whether 25,000 or 25 mil'
Survival of the fittest, either kill or be killed
Get ya game on playa', get ya game on
Get ya game on playa', get ya game on
Doesn't matter whether it's 25 bricks or 25 bucks
Survival of the fittest, either stick or get stuck
Get ya game on playa', get ya game on
Get ya game on playa', get ya game on
Yeah, press the start button
Tell these hoes to press the start button
Punch in your code and press the start button
And let the motherfuckin' games begin bitch!
For anyone of these flows just press the start button
Tell my foes to press the start button
For a ludicrous show, just press the start button
And let the motherfuckin' games begin bitch!
