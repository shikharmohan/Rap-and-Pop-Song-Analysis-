And in case you forgot, I'm tha King
Yea, yea, aye, aye, aye, aye
Who I'm is, nigga?
(I'm tha King)
T.I.P., Atlanta's own King of the South, shawty
(I'm tha King)
Yea, yea, yeah, better keep my name out ya mouth, shawty
(I'm tha King)
Yeah, PSC, nigga, aye, aye
All hail Atlanta's own, owner of Atlanta's throne
  (I'm tha King)
If ain't want no trouble leave, shit, shoulda left the man alone
It's been seen, shown and evident Atlanta's known
Tha King been the one representing all of Atlanta's zones
Back when niggas was representing Atlanta wrong
Every shot he got, he put the hoods of Atlanta on
The big screen then hit every trap and traveled on
Past, present to Texas to Alabama strong
  (I'm tha King)
Down in Miami, up to Louisiana homes
From the Carolinas, Virginia to David Banner's home
I'm well connected, haters, best to mind ya manners homes
I got a nickel-plated 38 but hey, the hammer chrome
And it shine like ya should set the phantom on
In it see me riding, getting blown like the saxophone
Hey shawty, spit the shit, it takes to cut a candle on
If I ain't on ya tube, dude, you must got ya channel wrong
I'm tha King of the South, there is none flyer
Sucker MC's outta call me sire
Ya songs okay but I'm on fire
  (I'm tha King)
24 inches on my rims and tires
I'm tha King of the South, there is none flyer
  (I'm tha King)
Sucker MC's outta call me sire
Thought you was on top
  (I'm tha King)
I pass right by ya
I will not stop and I won't retire
I came, I saw, I conquered with no big names
  (I'm tha King)
No fame, no celebrity sponsors
Just a game and a flow that was bonkers
Nigga, front if ya wanna
Dead niggas like the bitches from 'Monster'
Now you been told so don't say I ain't warned ya
And don't let it alarm ya when ya leaking then the reapers upon ya
Speak on me and I'm creepin' upon ya, say that I ain't tha King
But you just sour, you ain't think of it aren't ya
All the hating, is no time to respond, I miss tryin' to conjure up
A way to get experience and launder
Hey, I thought ya record company conned ya
Into signing a deal, shy of a mill 'cause they really ain't want ya
Moving yay, it's safe to say that they own to ya
So it's time to move on to real estate
And get cake selling big estates
  (I'm tha King)
I'm King of the South now but it's fifty states
I'ma spread out and I'll eliminate, who in the way?
  (I'm tha King)
I'm 24 today, give it to, I'm 28
I'll be ruler of all that I survey and not just in the state
  (I'm tha King)
See, I bend just to win but I ain't finna break
Most you niggas fake and I'll say it in nigga's face
I'm tha King of the South, there is none flyer
  (I'm tha King)
Sucker MC's outta call me sire
Ya songs okay but I'm on fire
  (I'm tha King)
24 inches on my rims and tires
I'm tha King of the South, there is none flyer
  (I'm tha King)
Sucker MC's outta call me sire
Thought you was on top
  (I'm tha King)
I pass right by ya
I will not stop and I won't retire
I'm tha King
I'm tha King
I'm tha King
I'm tha King
I'm tha King
