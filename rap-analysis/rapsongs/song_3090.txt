Understand, I come from south central
Motherfuckers don't know what I been through
I keep my motherfuckin' heat in my igloo
And it's lookin' for some meat, it can get through
Fuck with me, there will be agony
In these streets, it will be a tragedy
Can't you see, it ain't no fag in me?
If it was I would've joined the academy

I never take shit from rappers
I turn them motherfuckers into cadavers
I'm fuckin' mo', niggaz than Napster
'Cause youse a trick and your Ghost Rider is Casper
I heard you lost on Fear Factor
'Cause you couldn't swallow deez nuts big as a tractor
You dumb bitch think I'm an actor
And a nigga couldn't get close enough to slap her
(Word up, bitch)
Ice Cube, understand it's real
I'm the nigga of steel, got you 'killin' at will'
Got my nigga a deal, he tried to fuck me and steal
I love the nigga but he now feelin' the chill
It's west coast, east coast
  (West coast, east coast)
South side, worldwide

North side, let's ride

Let's do it 'til God and the Devil collide, come on
