(Yo Gotti)
It's a white world
All white land

White men can't jump but the work can
And this a coupe you can't ride but yo hoe can
Two shifts both stoves me and young
Streets talkin this the realest shit yall eva done
Heard if it was snowin in the summer would the world end
I'm talkin rain and quarter ounce will get yo ass in
Mayonnaise whip
Cottage cheese seats
Marshmallow rims
Yea dat bitch a beast
White Camaro black stripes call it tiger woods
White girl under par birdies in the hood
