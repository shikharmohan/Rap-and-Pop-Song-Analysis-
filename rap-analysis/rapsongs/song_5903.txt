Check it out
I heard this track here right and I kind of felt a lil' somethin'
You know, it took my mind some place it ain't been
So I'm trying to figure out what make this world go round for real
People are stressin'
Oh how, oh how come every time we have problems they nix none
Sending people to other plants when they still ain't fix this one
Victims from a distance, predictions of affliction
Some faction cause frictions, some fractions need fixing
Mixing making music man to make it work
Some sticking shakin' bruisin' damn just ta brake a purse
It's worse misguided some guttered locked on the block
'Cuz the cops can't be trusted
Busted, trusted, frustrated, frustrations of no more patience
Insides are cold and vacant, check how we lay it
Why when we speak they try to stifle our breath
Cock a rifle to chest
Then ya have the party of your life at your death
Oh, I wanna know, I wanna know, oh, life goes
So I look at the kids and wonder where their life might go
Get high to tell ya low that's how its done on the bricks
We all mad at the world when the world ain't done shit
Just the people in it and the scavengers who function
Who destroy the earth then blame the earth for its malfunctions
And that's getting maybe a tad bit too deep to follow
But the black form is strong and far from being hollow
Why do we get so much into this freeing Willy when Willy is free
He and them ain't doing shit to free my city
And it's a pity for those who can't get the nitty gritty
That's when the gritty gets grimy and the wicked gets witty
So much pain on the brain can't restrain
Place the comma, too much drama but I'll bleed to please my momma
So I'm a strive to perfection, leave pride in slum sections
Keep wit my crew and make all due connections, connections
But, but, but, but, but that's what makes the world go round
But, but, but, but, but that's what makes the world go round
The axis and down the carousel
Oh, how the ways?
Nowadays baby's coming from spitting out momma's nipple
From the cradle to the killa leaving corpse and cripples
A Brooklyn boy dies shot by a cop for a play gun
Our kids days are up even if they ain't stray ones
You lay one or two on the more now the merrier the day's dumb
When crews war and now streets get scarier
Cops hit blocks saying we'll beat 'em into freedom
Then we feel robbed like there's no God when we need Him
So we act accordingly cause we don't' see enjoyment
The only line of business I'm offered is unemployment
So we gots to get ours and ours gotta get it
And it is what it be so see that I'm with this
Media has us believin' they hype
Don't pull out ya new shoes that's faking
Before our whole race is stripped naked
That's what makes the world go round
The axis and down the carousel
But, but, but, but, but that's what makes the world go round
The axis and down the carousel
But, but, but, but, but
