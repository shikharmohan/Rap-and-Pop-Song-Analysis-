I'm just playin the wall, I'm just playin the wall
Coolin with my niggaz on the right, hold tight
Late Friday night strobelight shine bright blind
Coolin at this party with the sugars on my mind
It's the sex patrol, the sex patrol
Yeah the young sis was stacked wicked, wanted me to kick it
Said I never dance, made advance outside
Took a glance to expect, Shorty was correct
so it seemed, her name Shavon, age seventeen
I flipped when I seen her eyes, bloodshot green
She said she wanted riches and a nigga with cash
Lex Land' or a Path', didn't know the half
I react to flip the script and get ill
My man Malik B kept telling me to relax
Diggin how you're livin on some unreal high
as I realize -- you're not that fly
You ain't fly
You ain't fly
You ain't fly
so go 'head, witcha self

Dig it, you see sisters is thinkin that I snooze
She must don't know, I have a sister confused
Thinkin that she's pretty and saditty when I spill
She said, "I might, I think I can, alright I will."
Tossed up was the digits cause the game is like splendor
I said, "Sabrina yea, I met you way back in December; you remember."
She said, "I guess."
Substitute to Santa, she was sittin on the desk
And then she said, "You never called me; Mailk you never tried to press.
You never tried to push the seven buttons and address."
I said, "Hold up sis -- you're out of order, man you lost it.
My name ain't Jake; Malik's no Flake that's Frosted."
Tryin to cause a scene Sabrina's rest is self-redeemed
She thought she was cute, but never made it on my team
I should beam up, about-face fall out
And don'tcha even dare to ask why -- because you're not that fly
You ain't fly
You ain't fly
You ain't fly
so go 'head, witcha self

Mmmmmm strollin in my Pumas down the avenue
Not tokin on a J, not sippin on a brew
Saw a soul sister on the streets of five-two
"MMM, my name's Question, ummmm, who are you?"
She didn't respond, she didn't respond
???*MUFFLED VOICE*??? -- Continue on
Thought to myself, should of said a little louder
Bet hurry up before she gets lost in the crowd of
"Excuse me Miss, excuse me miss"
"No, I'm not havin it!"  I just got dissed
I didn't get mad, was calm and collect
I didn't call her bitch, I didn't break her neck
Start to wonder why the brothers disrespect the cutie
It's a place of 180's and the high-priced floozie
As she walked away, man I couldn't deny
Started lying to myself, man she wasn't that fly
You ain't fly
You ain't fly
You ain't fly
so go 'head, witcha self

Black, butter umm... that's what I be
Had to tell a girl to set her mind free
Use the Third Eye possibly you will see
what you get, with material objects
Wanna be the envy of the whole projects gettin loot
Pretty in your cute limited Express suit
Baby I can see everything you wanna be
See you're gamin as a key to escape poverty
Known to be shown around, sport about her niggaz
Thinkin you a woman cause your ass got bigger
Kickin it to me as if I don't know the time
But I'm the BlackThought, I'm all up in your mind
I figure you the kind to say, "Give me a call"
but then switch to act strange, countin on my change
Pay to the order of who???  Not you
Why?  You're not THAT fly
You ain't fly
You ain't fly
You ain't fly
so go 'head, witcha self
