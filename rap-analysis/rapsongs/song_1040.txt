Live from the South Side this one
Hide your gun, representing Chi-Town to the fullest
Raps or bullets, see them rappers, they be duckin'
When Com be buckin' in the kitchen, fuckin'
On the sink, got my mama a mink
Think Common is the link, thought the game was extinct
Lay there, them jeans is as slim as Shady
Brought 'em back from the 80's, now let's make some babies
Freestyle paid off so Lincoln paid me
No we can push more whips than slavery
Alex Haley and this rap shit, my roots is deep
You heard the bitch is you, yeah I know what's beef
Let it cook and I pop like grease
You thirsty niggas can't stop my feast, uh
I still love her, she be needin' the dick
When it come to hip hop it's just me and my bitch, uh
Everybody I'd like to announce

Baby, you're like, what the fuck? There is no other
Valet crushed my Rolls so quickly I bought another
Sorry Mr. William moved out the building
Spot to the top, fifty feet with was the ceiling
Slow down son, you're killin' 'em, well funded it was not
Came to shitty deals, reminiscing give me chills
When Puff was with Biggie, Versace on every niggie
The backpacker copped the Porsche and drove to his city
Now all the little bitties from ugly to pretty
I was the magician mesmerize 'em, made 'em listen
My dick is like a Blow Pop baby
And it gets stiffer than some Botox baby
But show out baby and show me you ain't gon' act right
And I'll be pedaling backwards like a track bike
She ain't know the Casio cost a hundred
It's been two years since I done it, now all the rappers want it, what?
Everybody I'd like to announce
Throw you hands up when we in the house
Yeah, this is hip hop baby
I'm fin' to take you to the tip top baby
And tell your girl that the tickets is out
And we gon' do it till they kickin' us out
'Cause this is hip hop baby
I'm fin' to take you to the tip top baby
As I sit back, relax with Chicago on my back
Unzip the backpack, pull out a fifth of Jack
I'll probably go to jail for, naw that ain't me
I style crazy and act like Jay-Z
The black Kojak, I get money and want mo' stacks
The rap photographer, the way the flow stop
Broads say, "Are you a philosopher?"
"Yeah yeah, I philosophize on top of ya" Uh!
Everybody I'd like to announce
Throw you hands up when we in the house
Yeah, this is hip hop baby
I'm fin' to take you to the tip top baby

And we gon' do it till they kickin' us out
