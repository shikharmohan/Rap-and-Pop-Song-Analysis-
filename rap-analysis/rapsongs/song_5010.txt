They thought it was cool to burn crosses in your front lawn
As they hung you from trees in your backyard
They thought it was cool to leave you thirsty and stranded, Katrina
He thought it was cool to carry a gun in his classroom
And open fire, Virginia Tech, Columbine, stop the violence
They thought it was cool to tare down the projects
And put up million dollar condos, gentrification
They think it's cool to stand on the block
Hiding products in their socks making quick dime bag dollars
They think its cool to to ride down on you
In blue and white unmarked cars bustin' you upside yo head
Freeze 'cause the problem is we think it's cool too
Check your ingredients before you overdose on the cool
