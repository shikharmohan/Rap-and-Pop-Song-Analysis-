Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do
Yo, Deltron thunder force, ain't no other source of sunlight
Two ton mic, leave you tongue-tied
Runnin' amuck with technology with no apology
Shoutin' out to my colony with third eye physiology
Millennium past apocalypse is all I spit
Make you swallow it, your weak style, I'll abolish it
With nuclear rockets, they glued to your optics with sci-fi
Unsettlin' man and metal blends
Underground chillin' with the Mole Man and his whole fam
Inhibit bacterial growth, material wrote
Impenetrable, incontestable, indigestible intelligence
Never let a computer tell me shit
It's rapid innovation, penetratin'
Artificial life forms who bite songs
I'ma buy a vest, lies next, then I'll flip the biotechs
Right into the wireless, your third eye is hit with psoriasis
The mightiest Deltron Zero
Traverse and purge the travesties that tempt your ear holes
The area of distribution, lifts the clueless
My flow is like, liquid oxygen
Rip it often with specific impulse, increasin' thrust
Grease the cuts, unleash a cluster of thoughts I muster
I talk to touch ya and rupture commercial communications
Convert solar energy into imagery
In the mind's eye, blindside the contagious
With radioactive isotopes to decay them
Atomic mass, they small as fragments
I magnetize the avid lies
My radiation shields reflects, rejects Decepticons
Who take the truth and stretch it long while I bless a song
Next level incredible, metal meldin'
Flexibility and my engine is never failin'
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do
All your rhyme histories combined couldn't violate
The Prime Optimus operative
Use my hydrometer to see how warm you are, watch me form a star
Hydrogen turned to helium when I shine
Ridin' 'em, revealin' 'em, leadin' 'em to the vacuum
Interact with tunes in my digital citadel
Critical pivotal with the mental shit on you
Spit infinity, hidden energies too dope for our planet
Star spannin', slammin' hymns
With mechanical limbs, scannin' your lens
With cosmic rays, you'll all get played, your brain's inferior
I hit the lateral and posterior
My science is eerier
Ionic bondin' for your moronic ponderin', meet the armorines
My micro machines, might throw your team into paralysis
They not talented, just a malady
Worry 'bout a salary, creative casualty
Couldn't defrag my power density intensity
Nonequivalence, nine hundred newtons
Crush you like crotons, you plus Houston
Hiero's like dipoles inside a silo
Turbulence ten-fold, never simple
Defies accepted methods, development most unique
Paralyze central nervous when you close to me
Interstellar void fills with color, appears to bubble
And split into four like amoeba
Inhabitin' planets with grandiose boast
And coast like Silver Surfer, feel the purpose
High velocity, verbal atrocities
Fire resistance, better hire assistants
My pistons glisten ultra, high performance
Inside your private quarters where I fry your components
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do
