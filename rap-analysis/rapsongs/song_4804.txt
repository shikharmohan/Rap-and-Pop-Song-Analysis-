The act of makin love is
Pink cookies in a plastic bag, gettin crushed by buildings
Pink cookies in a plastic bag, gettin crushed by buildings
I'll take 30 electric chairs
And put'em in a classroom
30 MC's
And set'em free from thier doom
Just like a tomahawk cuts through the wind
When we begin
The wheel of furtune it spins
Holdin'
The rhythm like elastic
Moldin'
Your whole body like plastic
So why try to deny what ya already know ya love
Up above
Cause the mania
Hysteria
In the streets
While ya lovers gettin merrier
In the sheets
I met this lady named
Sweet young thing and
She gave me that feelin
That sunshine bring in
Hordable
Sportable
Totally affordable
Silky smooth
Voice was real audible
I said your cool as Ice Cuba
She said, "your that Public Enemy
I seen on the tuba."
Naw
I'm like your Uncle baby
The style of your beautiful face
Drives me crazy
Well can we do ya so Heavy ah D?
She said, "You tried to play me
Like Big Dad-dy."
I said, "I know your Tribe
I Called and re-Quested
For you to be manifested."
She said, "You know the Same Gang and my Flava Unit too?"
I said, "You only knew the certain things I wanna do, do you?"
Rub ya down with warm Ice-T
Make ya feel Bran Nubien
In-stant-ly
Boogie Down
And check this Production
Gimme them lips
They look good for suction
She said, "Sweet tease
Cool with a little almond joy
On the side
Just doin' the fly"
You like poundcake?
Comin' to my house
Turn on the lights
And see me on the couch
I said, "Do the jingle
And your from around the way
I like your earrings
L's
But anyway
Your grand-daddy is
Here to spread cheer
Somethin nice and smooth
With my tounge in your ear
Give me a snack
Some Salt And Pepper on a burger
Ice Cube T
Or if you prefer the
Taste of honey Kid
Ride in my Capri and
That's the joint
They got the real clear CD in
She said, "Stars couldn't get me in a car
I don't know what type of man ya are
You might know karate
Do me and get away
I got a glimpse of your license plate
N-W-A."

Pink cookies in a plastic bag, gettin crushed by buildings
Pink cookies in a plastic bag, gettin crushed by buildings
Pink cookies in a plastic bag, gettin crushed by buildings
She was Chubb-y and
Ready to Rock
Naughty By Nature and
Part of my private stock and
Ridin in the relax
Frame of mind and
Hmmmmmmmmmmmm
Hammer timin
Incredible
So edible
And unforgettable
Soft like a Q-Tip
I'd love to get with you
Cause I'm the type of guy that got props do
Feel it in mo and more
When I get ready for a showcase
Put together well
I go deep
And have an oil well
Show and tell
I said, "Yo-Yo
You're so intelligent
And elegent."
I n-I never Run to be D
With another MC
I got what I want
Right in front of me
I know a kid named K
He's a MD
Last time I heard
Yo, was gettin real friendly
Belly to belly and
Chest to chest
Thigh by thigh
Leg by leg and
I guess
Ain't no way to get ya out
Your so caught up S-E-X-U-A-L - sort
Of a freaky situation
With a peppermint twist
Ricky or Mike is next on the list
Nastified and all-funkified
Come'on
Come'on
Come'on
Ride
Can you hear?
Never fear
Whatcha hear
What ya hear
Is it clear?
Understand
And love ya big dear
And I will appear
My dear
With a beer
And bags full of cheer
And waterbed
YEAH
Cause I rumble and groan
She said, "You got to be bad to
Make the moanie moan."
Ain't no reason to front
On the way your life shown
Booyaa
How I'm jumpin' your bones
Like a Grand
Master in a Flash
Put out your cigarette
And rest your tired ash
All I wanna do
Is make woopie
Your my pink cookie
Not a wookie
When you take it off
I'd love a lookie
Cause I'ma mix it up toss style
Peace out
You got the sexual profile
