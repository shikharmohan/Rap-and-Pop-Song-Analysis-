This is the intro, I dent foes
And bend them and upchuck send ya outta luck fuck
That shit is nasty, I blast the MC's
Who try to sneak past me, I'm dastardly
I scare 'em dare 'em to maneuver, I'm smoother
I will prove to all your boys that I do the
Psychotic plot if it's necessary, yes, it's very down, pat
Now I'm tellin' brothers brown black lighter
Fight for ya righta, I incite riots
If they try that shit that happen in the '60s
I ain'ts the whimpee, I simply flip the whip
That holds my flow, so no foes will know
What motivates me, I show no race, see
It's higher conspirin' on MC's who tire me with wackness
Usin' metaphors, breakin' backs if it comes to that
'Cause I'm the one who raps
Fillin' gaps in the space
Perhaps there's a space for me in the world of rap
Your girl's on my lap, she's on the dilznick
I kill shit, the negative feels the musical sedative
And I'm ahead of them
I'm goin' tha extra mile and I bet you smile
'Cause my texture's wild, yeah
I'm goin' tha extra mile and I bet you smile
'Cause my texture's wild
I'm goin' tha extra mile and I bet you smile
'Cause my texture's wild, yeah
I'm goin' tha extra mile and I bet you smile
'Cause my texture's wild
I only give a little ittle blurb
If I prefer to confuse, now were you enthused
Just by the way I play with syllables?
And still I do work 'cause I pursue jerks
'Til they know I'm berserk
Quick with my quirk like Dirk the Daring
You can spare me the tears, I ain't carin'
Just preparin' for Armageddon, ya head in
A guillotine is sure to thrill a mean
Motivation [Incomprehensible] placed in a casket
Drastic, you'll get ya ass kicked bein' placid
Ask if I rips suddenly, I say
What in the hell is you speakin'
Neva change my strange way that I come about shit
But you doubt it, wanna dis the D E?
Then you see me and you shout if
I would come to you and screw you
You new crew and you got the bitch with the mad voodoo
Over niggas because you know the vigor
That I use to abuse hoes and foes
So get a whiff of the spliff that I'm puffin'
Ya wanna step to me in the club but I dubs nothin', yeah
I'm goin' tha extra mile and I bet you smile
'Cause my texture's wild
Yeah, I'm goin' tha extra mile and I bet you smile
'Cause my texture's wild, yeah
I'm goin' tha extra mile and I bet you smile
'Cause my texture's wild
Yeah, I'm goin' tha extra mile and I bet you smile
'Cause my texture's wild, bass
