That shit
Yo, yo yo yo, yo
Yo, check it
Yo, I'm too old for these young whippersnappers out here
I'm a legend, you should be popping corks to my beer
When I appear full gear, down from the rear
Sliced so quick you thought doc, whispered in your ear
Yeah, there's too many MC's but not enough MC's
Are raw like that liquid that you pour on mint leaves
Look around the premises, spot blemishes
Call me doc o dog, more Menace than Dennis
It's him in this, the raunchy shit I prefer
So every word be hard to turn when you stir
My grill, my balls, my jaws
Stretch twelve floors vacate your college dorm halls
I can stand still and ricochet off the walls
The gun sparks yourself cause your pee ate the stall
Who shot J.R.? I did, right in the melon
So I could own a ranch and start fuckin' Sue Ellen
I do murders that's hard to solve through forensic
Any clash of hash able to burn I bent it
You push a six while I push a rented tempest
Rocking, hoe hopping, bumping lil' Kim shit
Ay yo, niggas popping shit red
I don't care
Bitches say you don't got money
I don't care
Yo, nigga say he nicer than you
I don't care
I'm knockin somebody right the fuck out
  (I don't care)
He got a big icy chain
I don't care
He got a Benz and a range
I don't care
His records get mad airplay
I don't care
I'm knockin' somebody right the fuck out
I don't care
Yo yo, fuck all you radio that wanna play clean singles
I cleaned mine for years and still ain't hit a million
Why? I get the Buddha heads bugging
Shit, I should be four mil' and better for that shit I'm unplugging
Doc rocked every corridor in Florida
Watch the formula pour sucker absorb it up
And while you foaming up from the two in your Nautica
I orchestrate the orchestra to orchestra
Never trust no bitch, map your click
She ain't with it, call Tyrone to pack her shit
Funk doc, Goldeneye, Double o Agent
I be in court more than them dollar cap Haitians
Lick a shot, blaow think the doc is goin' pop?
Eat a cock, blaow ready for real hip hop
To rock the block blaow, all chicks I turn 'em out
Send their boyfriends back home, taking the garbage out
Ha ha, yo, I'm a sewer rat the tracks
With gnats bigger than Will Smith gat in Men in Black
And if it's Friday, you better double your lap
I hit you on the floor saying my neck and my back
Yo, let's settle it out of court for ten dollars smoke
Two fifty in jawbreakers, dollar in envelopes
Yo, how tight are you? Tighter than a Federal jail
How high? You better check double XL
Yo, niggaz say you ain't shit
I don't care
Yo bitches say you broke as fuck
I don't care
Nigga say he better than you
I don't care
I'm knockin' somebody right the fuck out
  (I, I don't care)
Yo yo, he got a lot of fucking ice
I don't care
Yo, he got a Benz and a range
I don't care
He get forty spins a day
I don't care
I'm knockin' somebody right the fuck out
   (I, I don't care)
I don't care
I'm knockin' somebody right the fuck out
   (I, I don't care)
I don't care
I'm knockin' somebody right the fuck out
   (I, I don't care)
Yo, this time
