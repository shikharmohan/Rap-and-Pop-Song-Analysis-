(One, two, y'all know, y'all know, y'all know)
Alright, we gon' keep it movin'
  (Check this out though)
We gon' keep it movin', we gon' keep it movin'
Get 'em up, y'all know what time it is, get 'em up
  (Right you are)
You a true underground head
You know what this mean right here baby
This ain't motherfuckin' LL Cool J, get it up
You know what this mean?
It don't mean lazy, motherfucker either
Get it up, aight?
(You ready Prim'?)
 It don't mean
(Everybody keep your L up like that)
It don't mean nothing, but one thing
Big L, Big L, Big L, Big L
Big L, Big L rest in peace
Yeah, yeah [Incomprehensible] come on
Yeah, yeah do you want to rest in peace?
Yeah, what are the best chances?
Big L, throw that L up in the air
We gon' have you do this shit
All motherfuckin' night so get used to it, get used to it
This is for my man Big L, word 'em up
Put ya L's up, put ya L's up
Put ya L's up, put ya L's up
Big L, Corleone, my nigga, my nigga C-Town
My big brother, Big Lee, holdin' it down
Flamboyant baby
For life, Big L, for my man Big L, Big L
Yo, do you know the game plan? C-Town, that's my main man
We never bring luggage, we go shoppin' when the plane lands
Still run with the same clan, used to be a Kane fan
Everything I rock is name brand, L'll make ya dame swallow
Your ice don't shine and your chain hollow
While you front in clubs for hours with the same bottle
Takin' midget sips, I run with the richest clicks
Tap the thickest chicks, plus drop the slickest hits
You know nuttin' about L, so don't doubt L
What's this motherfuckin' rap game without L?
Yo, that's like jewels without ice
That's like China without rice or the Holy Bible without Christ
Or the bulls without Mike or crack heads without pipes
The village without dykes or hockey games without fights
Don't touch the mic if you unable to spit
Flamboyant is the label I'm with, motherfucker
Big L, Corleone
My nigga, my nigga C-Town
My big brother, Big Lee, holdin' it down
Flamboyant baby, for life
