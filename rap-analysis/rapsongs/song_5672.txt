Magnetic, the flows are athletic
Dimensions are perfected but the static and kinetic is power
Past pressure and mass beyond measure
You can place son where ever he
(Don't stop)
Magnetic, the flows are athletic
Dimensions are perfected but the static and kinetic is power
Past pressure and mass beyond measure
You can place son where ever he Bed-Stuy

Magnetic, the flows are athletic
Dimensions are perfected but the static and kinetic is power
Past pressure and mass beyond measure
You can place son where ever he Bed-Stuy
(Thank you and thank you very kindly)
Magnetic, the flows are athletic
Dimensions are perfected but the static and kinetic is power
Past pressure and mass beyond measure
You can place son where ever he Bed-Stuy forever
The fresh, the author
And associates are proud to present
M-Def the Black, fantastic raw dynamic
True Ecstatic ghetto
Outstanding classic active every place
I have the skill, power, passion raise your red lantern
Stanzas and anthems based on expansion
A vantage point of the past, present and after
Rapture, master of ceremony, a master craft
Of the masterminds who craft masters
Master and viber from Brooklyn Island
Legendary asylum, Black Star shining
Bedford-Stuyvesant isn't Strivers
Flatbush blazing like it's smoke of the prophet
And it's constant, my mother an artwork
And God is the author from Flaco to Archer
We right on target, a ready steady responsive
A black light white in the darkness
Y'all just are fantastic rawness, good morning, yes
You are rocking with the fresh
You are rocking with the fresh
You are rocking with the Def with a kiss
Yes, right now on it always
So shocking, never stopping
Always keep the beat on popping
Yes, right now on it always
Play on Adidas
You know you can't stop my go
You can't stop my go
Born to be who I am
(Been born to be who I am)
Bright light from a distant star
(Bright light from a distant star)
Miracles, answered prayers
(Miracles, answered prayers)
All in together now
You can't stop my go
I've been born to be where I am
A bright light from a distant star
Miracles and answered prayers
You can't stop my go
I've been born to be where I am
Mos light from a distant star
Miracles and answered prayers
Yes, yes, right now on it always
So shocking, never stopping
Always keep the beat on popping
Yes, yes, right now on it always
Author and associates are proud to present
