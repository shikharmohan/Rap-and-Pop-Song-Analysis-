Gonna get in the car
Drive away
Drive so far
No one's gonna find me
Put my foot on the gas
Accelerate
Some days I be wantin' to get away, from it all
To be real this game ain't all it seem to y'all
I mean I'm blessed by my good God high, that no question
And I know my journeys long just a life learned lesson
But the world's just a mess right now, gone all crazy
Thankful for my single mother, strong how she raised me
Could've gave up long time and been lazy
But my dream's strong, hear this song I'm not complainin'
Just the realisation, livin' in this world of dreamin'
I mean I cry real tears and I got real fears
Want a marriage and some babies, do ya'll hear me in ya ears?
Discouraging, keep ya courage and walk ya path
Question everyday, "How much longer will we last?"
How can you apologize for mankind?
No heart, no soul got sight but yo, the man blind
Not really seeing what he done to the future, he lost
Gonna get in the car
Drive away
Drive so far
No one's gonna find me
Put my foot on the gas
Accelerate
Drive so far
No one's gonna find me
Love, hate, pain, all the same
Still took for granted, either reason that's to blame
Gone 'coz he loved her, gone 'coz she hated him
Flipped out, taken out from the pain, who she datin' him?
It's like we don't have no meanin', what we breathin' for?
Birth, child raised right, gone now, fightin' for the war
Damn! Enough to make you crawl up in a shell
Cry for the innocent babies in this hell
Stuck from a fast fuck no shelter from the cold
Drugs and disease never growin' to be old
Do you feel me? Am I seein' all this by myself?
Can't trust the air I breathe, I'm prayin' for my health
Wanna get away but where I'm supposed to go?
Can't escape it so I'm makin' songs, let it flow
I said I wanna get away but where I'm supposed to go?
Can't escape it so I'm makin' songs, let it flow
Gonna get in the car
Drive away
Drive so far
No one's gonna find me
Put my foot on the gas
Accelerate
Drive so far
No one's gonna find me
Sometimes my heart hurt
Wish I could take away the pain with music
But it won't work, I guess I'm just an optimist
What's it gonna take for all o' us to stand up, put a stop to this?
Man, we in this thing together
Live and breathe together
Everybody love life but never make it better
Everybody talk shit but never get together
Shit, I ain't tryin' to preach I ain't even teachin'
This some shit that's bottled up inside me, I'm just speakin'
Wanna get away but where I'm supposed to go?
Can't escape it so I'm makin songs let it flow
I said I wanna get away but where I'm supposed to go?
Can't escape it
So I'm makin' songs let it flow
