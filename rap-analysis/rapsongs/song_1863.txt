Now I know only I can stop the rain
Now I know only I can stop the rain
It's not that we gotta do what we do
It's what we know, so to me it ain't nuttin' but bein' true but
Now I know only I can stop the rain
It doesn't have to be the way it is, you say it is
Just because for the past twenty years, every day it is
Now I know only I can stop the rain
I wanna be able to walk out my front door
Without worryin' about comin' in conflict with the law, 'cause
Now I know only I can stop the rain
If I follow him, they'll follow me
And I'll speak life into the word that you can see, 'cause
Now I know only I can stop the rain
We get away with everyday shit but everyday shit
Catches up to you and when it does you can't say shit
Now I know only I can stop the rain
If I don't, you will, when I won't, you steal
What makes it feel like we gots to kill?
Now I know only I can stop the rain
How many more lives must we lose?
How many more times must we choose to trust these fools?
Now I know only I can stop the rain
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
I gave it to you straight don't mix it, twist it up on some slick shit
Now I know only I can stop the rain
I don't have to talk to it any more
I don't have to walk to it any more, I'm out the door
Now I know only I can stop the rain
I wanna find peace with the Lord
I don't wanna find a beast with the sword, I can't afford to
Now I know only I can stop the rain
When every day of my life
Is a constant fight between wrong and right
Now I know only I can stop the rain
I thank you Lord for my life
Thank you Lord for keepin' it loose when things got tight
Now I know only I can stop the rain
Only I can stop the rain
Only I can stop the pain, yea
Now I know only I can stop the rain
Only I can stop the rain, stop the rain, yea
 
 
Only I can stop the rain, 'cause the rain falls on me
Now I know only I can stop the rain
Only I can stop the rain
