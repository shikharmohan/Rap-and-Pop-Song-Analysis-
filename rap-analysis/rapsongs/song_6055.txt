Who you gon' call when it's time to brawl?
Standin' 'round, waitin' for my Queendom to fall
Well, I think not, styles are pipin' hot
Blazin', amazin', I give it all I got
Who you gon' call when it's time to brawl?
Standin' 'round, waitin' for my Queendom to fall
Well, I think not, styles are pipin' hot
Blazin', amazin', I give it all I got
I'm tellin' you straight up all you sleepin' beauties better wake up
I'll tear your state up so set the date up
And I'm a rip it, what if it what was it
Who did it, who does it? From private to public
Anywhere I'm in there and been there so recognize this, who the nicest
Sit down and settle for your constellation prizes
Whatever you want I got, whether you ready or not
It's about to get hot when I drop so pick up, pause another spot
To do you, don't get me in a corner, make me do you
Don't try to be me, do you? Be coo' to you and do you
I'm on a higher level with different class, another plane
The Queen, that's my name, time to explain
That I spit game with dames, leave 'em all with shit stains
Split frames, hopin' you hopin' that I'm jokin'
Don't know but still blink off like fo'-fo's
But so-so, slow mo's comin' in like the po-po's
Don't want rocks comin' at me the wrong way
Packin' much rocks, it's gonna be a long day
For real, spittin' on imbessiles and spinnin' wheels
On my 600 you want it, you must be blunted
I'll take it to your stomach, run it, give me all
Mic for mic, steppin' to me you gonna fall, we brawl
Throwin' a two-piece so loose leafs
It's the Q U double E N, you know how I'm MCin'
Who you gon' call when it's time to brawl?
Standin' 'round waitin' for my Queendom to fall
I think not, styles are pipin' hot
Blazin', amazin', I give it all I got
Who you gon' call when it's time to brawl?
Standin' 'round, waitin' for my Queendom to fall
Well, I think not, styles are pipin' hot
Blazin', amazin', I give it all I got
See, physically you not ready, lyrically you not ready
Mentally maybe, who talks tough, time to get the baby
No threats or small bets on my bond we can get it on
From dusk 'til dawn, from night 'til morn
Some bubble hard squads's gone
No gimmicks, no tricks
'Til one of us admits it's a battle a whisk
So look, I'm off the hook, while you off the rocker
Thinkin' I'm shook, get the phone book, call the doctor
Are you out of your mind, doubtin' mines, out of line
Talkin' out your behind, shoutin' rhymes out of time?
It's all over, what's up? Yeah, what, what now? You tough now
Now you hush, hush now, ain't sayin' too much now
Thought so haunt yo' sleepin' ass, creepin' fast
Like you was doin' somethin', now I gotta ruin somethin'
You image, your career, lookie here
Your whole life is hangin' in the air like a chandelier
Poppin' off like a can of beer, understand, is it clear?
If not, let me put it in your ear that I'm royalty
Even though I'm low-key, you know me
You be singin' over my tracks like it's karaoke
If you don't know the half, you gon' feel the wrath
Represent the rugged path, the Flavor Unit staff
Droppin' mathematics, layin' you out like craftmatic
I'll let you have it so you don't want the static
Who you gon' call when it's time to brawl?
Standin' 'round waitin' for my Queendom to fall
I think not, styles are pipin' hot
Blazin', amazin', I give it all I got
Who you gon' call when it's time to brawl?
Standin' 'round, waitin' for my Queendom to fall
I think not, styles are pipin' hot
Blazin', amazin', I give it all I got
Bananas, bananas
