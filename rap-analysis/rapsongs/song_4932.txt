In this life one thing counts
In the bank, large amounts
In this life one thing counts
In the bank, large amounts
In this life one thing counts
In the bank, large amounts
In this life one thing counts
In the bank, large amounts
Now everybody wants a piece of my pockets
And it don't help when I'm screaming on these records that I'm rich
Calling people from my number now I block it
'Cuz ain't nothing worse then getting haunted by a stalkin' ass bitch
'Cuz good game I talk it and yet you're so true some women
Will have you feeling blue like Crips
I lay my feet upon the path and I walk it
And I spread my wealth out or someone close
Will have me layin' in a ditch I have my friends steal from me
Snatch my credit card and my wallet hit the town
And leave outstanding bills for me
They say, I got the cash for it and I can't recall
One single member of my family that never asked for it
They've been kicking down doors and bustin' out flows
They can't get me on the phone so they surprise me at my show
And everybody needs a loan plus they say they won't blow it
All I hear "Common c'uz, you know I'm good for it" Man
In this life one thing counts
In the bank, large amounts
In this life one thing counts
In the bank, large amounts
In this life one thing counts
In the bank, large amounts
In this life one thing counts
In the bank, large amounts
Now don't get me wrong 'cuz being rich is such a beautiful thing
But more money, more problems people drive me insane
Not giving no handouts no more so take advantage and flee
My goal's to set my friends up to make some paper like me
Put em in position and make their wishes come true
So they can have multiple accounts gain interest over night
Given a million dollars, what you gone do?
Map your life out for your kids-kids or would you spend it over night?
Now see me I'll do both I got unlimited funds
My daughters life was set before her stankin' butt turned one
And it don't help that I got 4 or 5 retirement funds
So if I choose before I'm 30 I can lay in the sun
My dividends can show and prove the real meaning of fun
That's why I live by the sword but you can die by my gun
The irs 'll never sweat me or even put up a fight
'Cuz I'm sure I'll pay more in taxes
Then you made in your life because
In this life one thing counts
In the bank, large amounts
In this life one thing counts
In the bank, large amounts
In this life one thing counts
In the bank, large amounts
In this life one thing counts
In the bank, large amounts
Now women these days don't want a man without a nice pay check
So he splurge even though our lives ain't in right place yet
Buying jewelery and some cars just to impress these whores
Mean while you child's poor like "daddy what you left me for?"
Yeah but it all comes back that's why I named my daughter Karma
Who's teaching me the lesson of life and making me smarter
I sweep her off her feet 'cuz I'm her knight in shining Armour
And I have your fucking head if anybody tries to harm her
Got to teach her about the game that most of us niggaz will spit
And about these scandalous ass women that get money through gifts
They'll suck a cold hard wood for some cold hard cash
Or ride a brother good to put a foot up on the gas
Of that brand new ride, pick up our friends
While you're slippin' she slides
Drop top Benz gold diggers inside
Crazy what the world will do for money
Thinking that everything will be alright 'cuz
In this life one thing counts
In the bank, large amounts
