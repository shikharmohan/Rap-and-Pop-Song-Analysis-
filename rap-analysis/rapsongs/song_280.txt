Okay
The way kids are living is 100% European
African boys and girls
Set down your Nintendo joysticks right now
Unplug the television
And make way for an old vision
Which will now be a new vision, yes
Headliner, lay the foundation
Dig your hands in the dirt
That's right
Children play with earth
That's right
Dig your hands in the dirt

Children play with earth

Children play with earth
That's right
Dig your hands in the dirt
Children play with earth
Gain knowledge of the big
But small earth around you
Dig your hands into the dirt
The dirt that made you
Get acquainted with the earth
The earth that eventually will take you
And the world that hopefully
Will appear to wake you
Children, play in the fields
Play in the grass, climb Mr. tree
Get to know each branch
Give it a name
For the branches resemble the many decisions
You will have to make in life
Eat of the earth children, grow an apple tree
Taste the apple, communicate
Watch and listen to the neglected mother of all
Short, tall children play with earth
Eat rhubarb wet from the rain
Beautiful fruits all the same
Pears, oranges and grapes from the vine
Children it is the earth's time
