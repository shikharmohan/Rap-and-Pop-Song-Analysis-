(Didn't I fool ya baby? Aww, didn't I fool ya?)
What's really good? X I'm in the buildin' man, yeah
  (Didn't I fool ya baby? Aww, didn't I fool ya?)
It's all, good, my, nigga
That's right, you know how we do dawg, pull it
Y.O., Harlem, we back part two man
Dark Man where you at?
Let's set this shit off, start this shit right
It's goin' down tonight
Dawg off the leash, dawg walks with heat
Dawg stalks the streets, in New York to eat
How many times do I gotta come through
Layin' that thing down, puttin' holes in you
You cats get it on the double, so stay the fuck
Out of my way, you don't want no trouble
We travel double far, to bring you trouble God
We rollin' double hard, yeah nigga Double R
I don't know what you thought it was, but it's not
But I know that you caught the slugs, they was hot
Get the fuck off the block, there's no more room
For bitch niggaz dawg I'm comin' to get niggaz
Lift niggaz, out they boots, dust it
'Cause I don't just walk around with them things to bust it
We go hard
Never mind what a nigga say, we go hard
We gon' play how we wanna play, we go hard
Man we do this shit all day, we go hard
Motherfucker
We go hard
Never mind what a nigga say, we go hard
We gon' play how we wanna play, we go hard
Bitch, we do this shit all day, we go hard
Motherfucker
Yo, I leave jail smoothly, jump in the pale hooptie
Fuck the dick-suckin'-ass nigga male groupies
Diplomats, you look at alliance, you shook in defiance
I'm cookin' up coke, lookin' for clients
I got the AK, SK, 40 cal
Scope red on your head still 40 thou'
Worse than files of [Incomprehensible] turf burstin' blaow
Give the church my child, ask to nurture thou
'Cause I've seen the hearses now
But if this was Gilligan's Isle, Thirstin' Howl
Look at his kicks, they worth a thou'
Isn't it sad, do what I say and wish that you had
You Michigan crabs, you stabbed you piss in a bag
Or worse than that, zipped in a bag
Broke to fractions, a division of math
From, Hollywood, shittin' on Shaft, we go hard
Killa killa killa, killa
  (Didn't I fool ya baby? Aww, didn't I fool ya?)
Killa
X and Killer Cam
  (Didn't I fool ya baby? Aww, didn't I fool ya?)
Dark Man X
Once again, pull it
I just love how it's goin', Cam, X flowin'
Get at 'em dawg, I'm already knowin'
Step lightly around dawg, I might be hittin' town dawg
You really tryin' to get down dawg?
Only thing I can do with pussy is fuck it
And I would tell you to suck my dick but you might suck it
See y'all niggaz the cat type, you still a baby get your ass wiped
Must I take a nigga's last stripe?
You're a bitch, now more bitch than a bitch
Still a bitch fuckin' bitch, you been a bitch
Know how we do, run up, in a bitch
Peep the crib, run up, in it quick
Everything breathin' stops, only thing my niggaz is leavin'
Is shots, you done got a nigga hot
Let me catch you on the block, bitch-ass niggaz is cowards
Done fucked around and dropped the soap in the shower
We go hard
Never mind what a nigga say, we go hard
We gon' play how we wanna play, we go hard
Man we do this shit all day, we go hard
Motherfucker
We go hard
Never mind what a nigga say, we go hard
We gon' play how we wanna play, we go hard
Bitch, we do this shit all day, we go hard
Motherfucker
