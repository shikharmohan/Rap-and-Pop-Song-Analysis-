DJ Khaled, Konvict Music
We the best, we takin' over, listen
I started in Atlanta then I spread out wit' it
South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi
On to North Carolina, Philadelphia and Virginia
From down in Miami where it warm in the winter
On up to Minnesota where it storm in the winter
Jackson then Tallahassee, Memphis, Tenn holla at me
Been in H-Town, Southside, Cloverland daddy
I'm the man out in Dallas, better ask Khaled
Kept me out in Cali with my eyes open barely
Blowin' and spinnin', goin' down Bennett
Drop six-fo', three-wheel then switch it
Red light stop, make it drop for the ***
Got a ***, *** your head off wit' it
Anything you hear that I said, I meant it
King got the crown then sped off wit' it
Say you need bricks, I said I get it
If you want to, we can supply you
Got enough work to feed the whole town
They won't *** you unless you try to
Come around and try to stomp on our ground
'Cause we takin' over one city at a time
Said, we takin' over one city at a time
Said, we takin' over one city at a time
Said, we takin' over one city at a time
Listen
Buzz is what I does
I get money everyday, everyday I does
That Benz is how I ride
Black flag on the left, two *** on right
You better move, AK all day
Get *** up like Shyne, that's on my niece
I'm B.I.G. like Diddy, dammit, I'm wit' it
Khaled, we did it, Biggie in my city
Please no fitted, *** it, I'm too pretty
Lean back and get brain, stupid, I'm silly
Money that come, runnin' like water
Mami so hot, dammit, she gorgeous
Miami on fire, you better be cautious
Might get *** on the porch of your fortress
Now they see it was no one from Port City
I run here, Rick Ross is boss ***
'Cause we takin' over one city at a time
Said, we takin' over one city at a time
Said, we takin' over one city at a time
Said, we takin' over one city at a time
Listen
Blat, when you see crack, better duck
Like the *** gotta ease past, *** what?
***, I don't give ***, I run these streets
Y'all talk that ***, I want that beef
I'ma tell you like a G told me
They'll come back quick if a *** O.D.
Cash Rule Everything Around Me
I'm YSL, Versace
You could see me in that Porsche GT
Comin' down Sunset sittin' on D's
Feelin' like 'Pac, All Eyez On Me
Fresh bandanna when I'm *** mad trees
*** please, I spit crack, every verse a ki
Some say Khaled, some say Colli
Twelve years down and I'm finally free
If you want to, we can supply you
Got enough work to feed the whole town
They won't *** you unless you try to
Come around and try to stomp on our ground
'Cause we takin' over one city at a time
Said, we takin' over one city at a time
Said, we takin' over one city at a time
Said, we takin' over one city at a time
Listen
Birdman dead, I'm number one
*** came at me wrong so we got him done
*** with the family, I'ma give him some
Spent that co'ner, he didn't run
Sunday had a whole church singin' a song
"Why'd they have to send my baby home?"
*** with some ***, that paper long
Been a G in the game, now my son on the throne
I am the beast
Feed me rappers or feed me beats
I'm untamed, I need a leash
I'm insane, I need a shrink
I love brain, I need a leech
Why complain on easy streets?
I don't even talk, I let the Visa speak
And I like my Sprite Easter pink
And my wrist special clock but the mule's cooler
I have more jewels than your jeweler
Touch and I will bust your medulla
That's a *** ***, it is not a tumor
Red like, red like stop your rumors
I stay on track like a box of Pumas
Now just r-r-r-rock with Junior
I am the little big kahuna, ya dig?
'Cause we takin' over one city at a time
