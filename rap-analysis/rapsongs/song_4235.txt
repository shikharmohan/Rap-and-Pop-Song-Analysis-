And i'll take probation
I dont want that T.I and Vick vacation
Private plane, pick location
Im going to the bank to make a big donation
Yeah, I dont stunt i stunt hard
And if the food aint on the stove
I hunt for it
But in the mean time you can call me young roy
Jones Jnr fighting the drugs and gun charge
Shit
Dont leave me unguarded
And ima cheese head, where the vince lambardi
Word to Mark Martin leave a snitch departed
All that blood like the red tea party
My gun go crazy like its retarded
Red light on it like its recordin'
I ain't recordin', im just C-4ing
My currency foreign
We are in a league they aren't
Better dig in your pocket and pay homage
Better cover your eyes, your face fallin
Watch the game from the side im play callin'
No i didnt say that im flawless
But i damn sure dont tarnish
My pistol got comments for your garments
Im so high i can vomit on a comet
KY no homo im on it
Weezy F Baby new bomb bitch
You know what they say about when your palm itch
Im gon get money, money, im gon get
Young Money in ya tummy, and we gon shit
And get that toilet paper quick like when bones spit
Thats right bitch im back on my grown shit
That Audemars Piguet
No ice just chrome shit
And your boyfriend softer than a foam pit
I scream fuck the world with a long dick
Muthafucker im me
Yeah bitch im me
You niggaz sweet like the pussy in which i eat
Fireman burn down your entire street 
So fly ima take off when i leap
bye
And you can suck my wings
Stand on my money head butt Yao Ming
Put your hand in the oven if you touch my things
Im shuffling the cards bout to cut my queens
But i aint the dealer(a)
House full of bitchs like Tila Tequila
Im the man in the mirror
My swagga just screamin' muthafucka do you hear her(a) 
Drizzy Drake 'what the lick read'  (means: how are you doing)
we make magic boy, Roy and sidfreed
Wow
Young Mula Baby
Ya
