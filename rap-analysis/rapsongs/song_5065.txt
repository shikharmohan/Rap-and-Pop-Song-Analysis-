You know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
So, check it out, uh
First got it when he was six
Didn't know any tricks
Matter fact, first time he got on it he slipped
Landed on his hip and bust his lip
For a week he had to talk with a lisp
Like thiss
Now we can end the story right here
But shorty didn't quit, it was somethin' in the air
Yeah, he said it was somethin' so appealing
He couldn't fight the feelin'
Somethin' about it
He knew he couldn't doubt it
Couldn't understand it
Brand it, since the first kickflip he land it
Uh, labeled a misfit, abandoned
Ca-kunk, ca-kunk, ca-kunk
His neighbors couldn't stand it, so
He was banished to the park
Started in the morning wouldn't stop till after dark
Yeah, when they said it's gettin late in here
"So I'm sorry young man there's no skating here"
And so we kick push, kick push
Kick push, kick push, coast

Kick push, kick push, coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be
So let's kick, uh, and push, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, and coast
Uh, uh ,uh
My man got a lil older, became a better roller
Yeah, no helmet, hellbent on killin' himself
Is was what his momma said
But he was feelin' himself
Got a little more swagger in his style
Met his girlfriend, she was clappin' in the crowd
Love is what what was happening to him now, uh
He said, "I would marry you
But I'm engaged to these aerials and varials"
"And I don't think this board is strong enough to carry two"
She said, "Bow, I weigh 120 pounds, now
Lemme make one thing clear
I dont need to ride yours I got mine right here"
So she took him to a spot
He didn't know about
Somewhere in the apartment parking lot, she said
"I don't normally take dates in here"
Security came and said, "I'm sorry there's no skating here"
And so they kick push, kick push
Kick push, kick push, coast
And the way they roll
Just lovers in the twine with no place to go
And so they kick push, kick push
Kick push, kick push, coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be
So let's kick, uh uh, and push, yea yea, and coast
Yea uh, swanky, yea, yea
Before he knew he had a crew
That weren't no punk
In they Spitfire shirts and SB Dunks
They would push, till they couldn't skate no more
Office building, li-b's wasn't safe no more
And it wasn't like they wasn't getting chased no more
Just the freedom was better than breathing they said
And they escape route, they used to escape out
When things got crazy they needed to break out
They'd head to any place with stairs
Any good grinds, the world was theirs, uh
And they four wheels would take them there
Till the cops came and said, "There's no skating here"
And so they kick push, kick push
Kick push, kick push, coast
And the way they roll
Just rebels without a cause with no place to go
And so they kick push, kick push
Kick push, kick push, coast
So come roll with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be
So let's kick, uh uh, and push, yea yea, and coast
