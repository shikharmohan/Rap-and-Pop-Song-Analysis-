Ya, uh, I was once told, you get your freedom
By letting your enemy know that
You'll do anything to get your freedom
Then you'll get it, it's the only way you'll get it
When you get that kind of attitude
They'll label you as a crazy Negro
Or they'll just call you a crazy nigga
They don't say 'Negro'
Or they'll call you an Extremist
Or a subversive, or a setatus, or a red or radical
But when you stay radical long enough
And get enough people to like you
You'll get your freedom
So don't run around here tryin' to make friends
With somebody who's deprivin' you of your rights
They're not your friends, no, they ya enemies
And treat them like that and fight them
And you'll get your freedom
And after you get your freedom
Your enemy will respect you, and we'll respect you
And I say that with no hate
'Cause I don't have no hate in me
I have no hate at all
So I say to you, big man
I'm the man you think you are
If you want to know what I'll do
Figure out what you'll do
And I'll do the same, only more of it, nigga
Damn, shit
Oh, it ain't over muthafuckers
