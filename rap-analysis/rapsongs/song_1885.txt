On and off the leash, I'm a beast of East
No one ever gonna cross me in the streets
My only worries if I'm gon' eat
Because we gon' walk these dogs
Yeah, live it how I spit it
Look at how I walk it, y'all *** could get it
But it must all go down, X is wit it
Because we gon' walk these dogs
You got it livin' phat when everyone stall
I'ma bring it back 'cause I'ma go hard
*** til' a *** play the yard
We gon' walk these dogs
Gettin' down has never been an issue
I'ma bust my *** and not gon' miss you
Hate the smell of the slug burnin' the tissue
We gon' walk these dogs
Trigger bust us still but thugs
And it's about to get real out of hand, dog
Better get your man, dog
Hit 'em and leave him where *** can't stand, dog
It's your man, dog
Trigger bust us still but thugs
And it's about to get real out of hand, dog
Better get your man, dog
Hit 'em and leave him where *** can't stand, dog
It's your man, dog
Y'all better come in, get him now
Better grab his arm and sit him down
N*** leave him in his house, I'm a put him down
We gon' walk these dogs
We don't give a f*** about you
You talk real slick, homie but we doubt you
Got slugs that'll put a n*** right back out you
'Cause we gon' walk these dogs
I'm right here now, n*** what up?
Always talkin' about how you could've, would've
But never doin' *** 'cause you sweeter then sugar
We gon' walk these dogs
Go on now, not the one
Kashmir, 7:30, put the pop the ***
Have your moms on the news sreamin', "Not my son"
'Cause we gon' walk these dogs
Trigger bust us still but thugs
And it's about to get real out of hand, dog
Better get your man, dog
Hit 'em and leave him where *** can't stand, dog
It's your man, dog
Trigger bust us still but thugs
And it's about to get real out of hand, dog
Better get your man, dog
Hit 'em and leave him where *** can't stand, dog
It's your man, dog
Don't f*** with things you don't know about
I'll have Mr. Smith & Wesson show him out
Take him to the desert and blow him out
'Cause we gon' walk these dogs
Right to the streets with the heat
Until I find somethin' to eat, don't sleep
*** around, thinkin' it's sweet til' a *** creep
'Cause we gon' walk these dogs
Don't cry now, it's too late
I'ma empty ya stomach of that *** you ate
One time from the park, make a *** lose weight
'Cause we gon' walk these dogs
Bigga, betta, stronga, fasta
*** a b*** bit longa if I have to
Then I [Incomprehensible] directly up
'Cause we gon' walk these dogs
Trigger bust us still but thugs
And it's about to get real out of hand, dog
Better get your man, dog
Hit 'em and leave him where *** can't stand, dog
It's your man, dog
Trigger bust us still but thugs
And it's about to get real out of hand, dog
Better get your man, dog
Hit 'em and leave him where *** can't stand, dog
It's your man, dog
