Ruff riders, ride or die, get at these niggaz dog
I don't really trust humans that much these days
Shit, fact of the matter is, I trust dogs more than I trust humans
Shit, nothin' like that dog love I tell you
Not just any dog,  gotta be a pit bull
Yep, thats the only dog for me
You don't wanna get caught in a pit with one a them boy
They make good companions, but even worse enemies
Its all on how you take it
Nothings goes down and I don't get a small piece of
Get the picture, see the beauty and the beast of
The mad man its the bad man is here
'Cause a nigga like me smells wreck in the air
Just be fair, shit that I be doin' to niggaz, and
Get away with the same shit ruining a niggaz
Cover all ground and not roll thick, like the fog
The only motherfucking friend I ever had was a dog
Never ate the hog but glad to say I smoked plenty of 'em
The 5th precinct, the name one of many of 'em
In one verse I'll beat you worse than you mama
I'll fuck around I 'll eat you first like dahmus
I'm a, play that ass out like bomber
Killed the nigga once for lookin' like he wanted drama
I'm buggin', the pain it hurts, I gotta scream, ahh!
Lettin' of a little steam society was just too much
I couldn't hack it, six motherfuckin' years in a straight jacket
But back it wasn't wise for wise for them to let me out the joint
I've never really got better, so I'm not on point
I just might flip, quick, but its too late to be bitchin'
Got more loose screws than the table in your kitchen
I'm itchin', lets hope you ain't around when I scratch
Just like I said before , I eats what I catch
Searchin' shit, will have a nigga hurtin' sick
The dirt you kick, will get you in the dirt an' quick
Word to maze you niggaz is kids, don't play
I'm too old for the jokes you'll get smoke, I don't play
I'm gonna say, whats gonna happen if you force my hand
Some, somewhere will be like, lost my man
Take it to heart its about to get dark so run that
All that shit niggaz talkin', been there done that
What black, think its a act, let me know
But he like what I'm sayin' so shut the fuck up and let me flow
Yo, you think its a game, keep playin'
They gonna find your ass, somewhere in the creek layin'
It's over, you just ain't layed down yet
And in a minute, you gonna be that
Motherfucker that they ain't found yet
Hold off on makin' movies and make moves
Stop talkin' about shit that you cant prove
I'm the mountain you cant move, so why you tryin'?
Lookin' at me stupid wonderin' why you dyin'?
Why you flyin', through the air, wit a big ass hole in your chest?
Wishin' you was holdin' a vest
But its too late for wishes, so you gettin' this rest
Go to sleep, papa will take care of the stress
God bless, and may He have mercy on your soul
Pop, pop! take these two more wit you, on your stroll, nigga
I don't really trust humans that much these days
Shit, fact of the matter is, I trust dogs more than I trust humans
Shit, nothin' like that dog love I tell you
Not just any dog, gotta be a pit bull
Yep, thats the only dog for me
You don't wanna get caught in a pit with one a them boy
They make good companions, but even worse enemies
It's all on how you take it
You know how we do baby, alright
Grand champ, you know how we do
Scratch all day, match all weight
Fuck nigga, cant be fuckin' serious
Raccoon ain't nuttin' but a big cat
