[Dr. Dre] 
I got my mind made up, come on; get in, get into it 
Let it ride, tonight's the night, yeah 
*repeat 2X* 
Yeah, yeah, come on 
[LL Cool J] 
Uh, you know you a freak 
Before the album went platinum, ya hardly speak 
And now you're skin grinnin, gassed off the chrome rims and 
twenty room mansion, I rest my Timb's in 
Uhh, I feel it how ya shake it 
Rings in ya belly, I can't take it 
Toss up your Moet, money make it 
Last week frontin, tonight butt naked 
I got the flava, make em Zoom-a-zoom 
The LL Cool J, [fuck it] give me room 
Looked up in my eyes as I lowered the boom 
Twenty thousand freaks packed up in one room, uhh 
[Dr. Dre] 
All I wanna do, is Zoom-a-Zoom Zoom Zoom 
(Mmmm, whatchu wanna do) Uhh, whatchu wanna do? 
*repeat 2X* 
[Dr. Dre] 
Once again it's on, can't be home 
The crime got me in the zone; homies blowin up the celly phone 
The world knew I had to come once mo' 
And just to let y'all know, I do my thing and still blow 
Nuff to burn ten mill' cells, confirmed 
The most anticipated since Tyson's return 
So come on everybody let's all get down 
Cause what we have, is a brand new sound 
[LL Cool J] 
All the mommies in the house gettin live tonight 
They wanna (Zoom Zoom Zoom, Zoom Zoom-Zoom) 
And all my dogs feel the vibe tonight 
They wanna (Zoom Zoom Zoom, Zoom Zoom-Zoom) 
Say what? 
[Dr. Dre] 
All I wanna do, is Zoom-a-Zoom Zoom Zoom 
(Mmmm, whatchu wanna do) Uhh, whatchu wanna do? 
[Dre] All I wanna do, is Zoom-a-Zoom Zoom Zoom 
[LL] Dre, whatchu wanna do? 
[Dre] Mr. Smith, it's on you, uh 
[LL Cool J] 
In other words, it's gon' be like that 
You young boys is blind, I'm seein them cats 
Evolutionary (what?) Revolutionary and legendary 
I got a climax waiting for each and every cherry 
I'm like a narcotic, niggaz is microscopic 
Dr. Dre and Cool J, is the topic 
Forever, my lyrics is rough and energetic 
Them cats is blazin? I don't get it, they cosmetic 
If shorty wanna step up? I'll twist his neck up 
You can't get no money battling me; that's like ripping your check up 
What partna? Take ten paces and turn around 
That quick, yo' whole ghost town is burnin down (Woooof!) 
What I spit, manipulates whole clicks 
Make em conversate on how real niggaz ride my dick 
It's like a serum, I just can't hear em 
All them new niggaz poppin new shit, I never fear em 
As we proceed 
To give you what you need 
Satisfaction guaranteed 
Work and die 
Yeah, yeah 
[Dr. Dre] 
I got my mind made up, come on; get in, get into it 
Let it ride, tonight's the night, yeah
