More advances than technology
Every day I stack chips, whether music or flicks
All these transparent cliques full of devilish politics
Wish they could take my longevity and bottle it for
(Ha)
But they can't so they kill for grants
Smuggle iron in the party, pop ex for hot sex with

Love's an illusion, mental and emotional confusion
Instant gratification oozing
Exotic temptress, eyes just like a empress
