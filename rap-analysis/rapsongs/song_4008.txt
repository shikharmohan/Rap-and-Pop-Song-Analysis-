[Intro] 
[breathing] 
[dog barking] 
[gun shot and glass break] 
[The Game] 
Punk ass mothafucka, get your ass up 
What chu was goin do? kill me in my sleep you bitch ass nigga? 
Tupac, Biggie! shut the fuck up! fucking dogs barking and shit 
[Punk Ass Motherfucker] 
Don't shoot! 
Don't shoot! 
[gun shot] 
[The Game] 
fuck You Nigga! 
[Chorus: Lil' Wayne] 
And I'm grindin' til I'm tired 
They say "You ain't grindin' til you tired" 
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide 
Looking to find 
A way 
Through the day 
A light 
For the night 
Dear Lord, you've done took so many of my people but I'm just wonderin' why 
You haven't taken [my life? x3] 
Like what the hell am I [doing right? x3] 
[My Life x3] 
[Verse 1: The Game] 
Take me away from the hood like a state penitentiary 
Take me away from the hood in the casket or a Bentley 
Take me away 
Like I overdosed on cocaine 
Or take me away like a bullet from Kurt Cobain 
Suicide (Suicide.. suicide..) 
I'm from a Windy City, like "Do or Die" 
From a block close to where Biggie was crucified 
That was Brooklyn's Jesus 
Shot for no fuckin' reason 
And you wonder why Kanye wears Jesus pieces? [My Life x3] 
'Cause that's Jesus people 
And The Game, he's the equal 
Hated on so much, "The Passion of Christ" need a sequel 
Yeah, like Roc-a-fella needed Sigel 
Like I needed my father, but he needed a needle [My Life x3] 
I need some meditation, so I can leave my people 
They askin' "Why?" Why did John Lennon leave The Beatles? 
And why every hood nigga feed off evil? 
Answer my question before this bullet leave this Desert Eagle 
[Chorus: Lil' Wayne] 
And I'm grindin' til I'm tired 
They say "You ain't grindin' til you tired" 
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide 
Looking to find 
A way 
Through the day 
A light 
For the night 
Dear Lord, you've done took so many of my people but I'm just wonderin' why 
You haven't taken [my life? x3] 
Like what the hell am I [doing right? x3] 
[My Life x3] 
[Verse 2: The Game] 
We are not the same, I am a Martian 
So approach my Phantom doors with caution (caution...caution) 
See these 24s spinnin'? I earned em, 
And all thse pictures of me and I burned 'em 
So there aint no proof that i ever walked through 8 mile 
Since they aint no proof,I never walked through 8 mile 
So eat this black music, and tell me how it taste, now? 
And fuck Jesse Jackson cause it ain't about race, now 
Sometimes I think about my life with my face down 
Then I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile [My Life x3] 
Damn, I know his momma's proud 
And since you helped me sell my dream, we can share my momma now 
And like MJB, "No More Drama" now 
Livin' the good life, me and Common on common ground 
I spit crack and niggas could drive it outta town 
Gotta Chris Paul mind state, I'm never outta bounds 
My life used to be empty like a glock without a round 
Now my life full, like a chopper with a thousand rounds [Gunshots] 
[Chorus: Lil' Wayne] 
And I'm grindin' 'til I'm tired 
They say "You ain't grindin' 'til you tired" 
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide 
Looking to find 
A way 
Through the day 
A light 
For the night 
Dear Lord you've done took so many of my people but I'm just wonderin' why 
You haven't taken [my life? x3] 
Like what the hell am I [doing right? x3] 
[My Life x3] 
[Verse 3: The Game] 
Walk through the gates of Hell, see my Impala parked in front 
The high beams on, me and the Devil share chronic blunts 
Listening to the "Chronic" album, playing backwards 
Shootin' at pictures of Don Imus for target practice 
My mind fucked up, so I cover it with a Raider hood 
I'm from the city that made you motherfuckers afraid of Suge 
(Compton... Compton...) 
Made my grandmother pray for good 
And never made her happy, when I bet that new Mercedes could [My Life x3] 
Ain't no bars, but niggas can't escape the hood 
They took so many of my niggas, that I should hate the hood 
But it's real niggas like me, that make the hood 
Ridin' slow in that Phantom just the way I should [My Life x3] 
With the top back 
In my Sox hat 
I'm paid in full, the nigga Alpo couldn't stop that 
Even if they brought the nigga 'Pac back 
I'd still keep this motherfucker cocked back 
[Chorus: Lil' Wayne] 
And I'm grindin' til I'm tired 
They say "You ain't grindin' til you tired" 
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide 
Looking to find 
A way 
Through the day 
A light 
For the night 
Dear Lord you've done took so many of my people but I'm just wonderin' why 
You haven't taken [my life x3] 
Like what the hell am I [doing right? x3] 
[My Life x3] 
[My Life x3] 
[My Life x3] 
[My Life x3]
