Hey y'all
I think we need a lil' excitement
In our relationship
A lil' role playin', know what I mean
You could be the doctor, I'll be the patient
I'ma let you feel my heartbeat
Chest to chest, can you feel my heartbeat?
Pull up your dress, can you feel my heartbeat?
We get the sweatin', you can feel my heartbeat
I'ma let you feel my heartbeat
Chest to chest, can you feel my heartbeat?
Pull up your dress, can you feel my heartbeat?
We get the sweatin', you can feel my heartbeat
Baby, it's time to switch out the way things go
Tonight's the night you'll be in control
I bought you a uniform so you could play the role
Now here's the stethoscope
Lady, I know before we was goin' kinda cold
The same old, the same old, we seem to take a toll
Tryin' to take it back, take a sip all go
And try a couple things we never did before
Maybe you could be a freak for me at the door
I come up to the crib, you dressed ready to go
Girl, take it down low and make it clap real slow
I never had so much fun without spendin' dough
Baby, you the star of the big boy show
I love you even more now you unpredictable
Once we in the bedroom there no tellin' what we do
So what you wanna do?
I'ma let you feel my heartbeat
Chest to chest, can you feel my heartbeat?
Pull up your dress, can you feel my heartbeat?
We get the sweating you can feel my heartbeat
I'ma let you feel my heartbeat
Chest to chest, can you feel my heartbeat?
Pull up your dress, can you feel my heartbeat?
We get the sweatin', you can feel my heartbeat
I like it when you're close than visible
This condition it critical off to the bathroom
There we go, you ride better than my new convertible
Yeah, time for you to buss out the new red pumps
I'm a lick shots, let the box spring jump
Go ahead and play the roll, I'm a give you what you want
Side to side, bring it back to the front
Dress up like the martial's on a man hunt
Leave all my jewels 'cause you love it when I stunt
I'll play any role except bein' the chump
My Jon lil' girl, you love it when I crunk
Your boy told smiff, I'm the future of the funk
Pretend we lil' kids play tag and dry hum
Feel my whole movie back to work just before lunch
That's what I want
I'ma let you feel my heartbeat
Chest to chest, can you feel my heartbeat?
Pull up your dress, can you feel my heartbeat?
We get the sweatin', you can feel my heartbeat
I'ma let you feel my heartbeat
Chest to chest, can you feel my heartbeat?
Pull up your dress, can you feel my heartbeat?
We get the sweatin', you can feel my heartbeat
I like it when you're close than visible
This condition it critical off to the bathroom
There we go, you ride better than my new convertible
Feel the excitement buildin', baby
It's excitin', it's thrillin', it's passionate
You know what I mean
Your heart is beatin' faster and faster
You feel that
What if you felt it ten times more than that
What about twenty times more than that
What about thirty times more than that
Heartbeat
