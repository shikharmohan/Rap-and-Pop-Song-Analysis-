Bust it
Hey yo, I just left the studio and it's about 2 in the morn'
I just finished doin' a song
Now I'm ready for sleep
But first I want spaghetti to eat
In this good Italian restaurant right up the street
So I jumped in the jeep, stash the heat under the seat
Then I got a beep
My voice is harsh, barely can speak
I called back on the cell, it's Coley, mad as hell
He told me to listen well as he started to yell
"I just seen Mike and Ben with your wife and a friend
And they just got a room at the Holiday Inn"
"It's my wife, you sure?", "Yeah I'm sure"
I saw the whore as soon she walked through the door"
"Yo, say no more, which one?"
"The one in Jersey, son, right over the bridge"
"We goin' hurt those hoes" "And hurt both of them kids"
Now I'm in the range
Switchin' lanes, doin' a buck 'n change
I can't wait to touch the lames and them fuckin' dames
Reach the destination, grab the heat without no hesitation
These niggas fuckin' up my reputation
I saw Corleone holdin' the chrome
Ice-grill, lookin' like he had a license to kill
And he had somebody else with 'em playin' the cup
Lookin' like he can't wait to start sprayin' shit up
"Yo, who that in the background?" "It's Tommy Giss"
"Oh, I didn't recognize you with your hat down
Son you ready, we got this whole shit mapped out"
Oh you ain't scared as no tome to back route
"Yeah, wo goin' to take the back route
And pull our gats out and throw our mask on
We ain't leavin' till everyone's dead and all the cash gone"
"We goin' to get our laugh on when we're through
But right now we got a job to do"
"So let's do it", hey yo, I stepped to the desk clerk
Put the gat to her dress-shirt
Told her to listen up before she get hurt
"They just walked in, party of four, two chicks, two males
What room they got?" She paused and said, "212"
Took the steps now I'm out of breath, I gotta stop smokin'
Them cigarettes goin' be the cause of my death
My heart beatin' fast now, 'cause it's about to pop off
Saw the door, let the glock off, tore the lock off
Took a deep breath, then ran inside at a quick pase
I felt disgraced, I should've shot the bitch in the face
Then my other two niggas ran in, each had a cannon
Ready to take care, how we done planned it
"These two crab cats, we know they hustle upstate"
We know they got stacks
'Cause they don't move with nothin' but weight
We got the cuffs and the duck tape and put it to use
Then told 'em when this is over we be lettin' 'em loose
Hey man, I kicked mike in his face, so I just had your back
You wanna live and tell my nigga where the stash at
He gave me the address then I ran outside
But first I took the keys to his van outside
And when I got there, I found 50 keys in a stash
A 100 pound of grass and 2 million in cash
I was dumb glad, the sit didn't fit in one bag
So I got three, filled 'em all up to the teeth
And put the bags in the van, then I locked the truck
When I got back, Coley done popped them punks
"Hey yo', fuck it l, we might as well pop these studs"
Man that's four bodies, two outta-towners and two hotties
And after that we ain't sleep for three days
We hit the PJ's, split the money three ways
Now we all laughin' hard, gettin' nice and weeded
Celebratin' nigga, heist completed
