Slippin', slidin', glidin', low ridin'
Ain't no hidin' from this hit
Fool, you know how we do it
West Side, I'm comin' from the West Side
West Side, it's hittin' on the West Side, yeah, fool
Ain't nuttin' goin' on but the bomb-ass rap song
Hittin' all night long
Just like me on the black and white ivory
Gettin' six on artillery, you don't want to see a G
Break yo' ass like dishes
Buster-ass tricks, sleep with the fishes
Runnin' from Lennox, up at Venice
They wanna have me in stripes, like Dennis the Menace
But that ain't poppin', ain't no stoppin'
Fo' hoppin', ass droppin'
Coupe DeVille, my truth can kill
Fool I got skills
So back on up 'fore I check that chin
Down as fuck and I'm full off Henn'
You gets no love and I thought you knew it
Fool, you know how we do it
West Side
It's bumpin' on the East Side
It's slammin' on the South Side
Makin noise on the North Side
Chillin' with the homies, smellin' the bud
Double parked and I'm talkin' to Dub
About who got a plan, who got a plot
Whom got, got and who got shot
'Cause everybody knows that he got the info
Crazy Toones hangin' out the window
Fool, I got them bomb-ass tapes
'Da Lench Mob', 'Planet Of The Apes'
I'm down with Eih' and Watts Up
'Kam And Solo', they got nuts
When Ice Cube write a sentence
I want 'The Bomb', just like George Clinton
S-K-D is down to catch a body
Put on 'Knee Deep', we'll turn out your party
You gets no love and I thought you knew it
Fool, you know how we do it
Fool, you know how we do it
I'm hittin' on the West Side
It's bumpin' on the East Side
Slammin' on the South Side
Makin' noise on the North Side
Now Jack B. Nimble, and Jack B. Quick
If you wanna jack me on a lick
'Cause I'm that fool from South Central
You think you stuck yourself with a number 2 pencil
That's how I poke hot lead in yo' ass
With 'Mo' Bounce To The Ounce' in the dash
Mash up, Venice, headed for the West
Everything is great, slow down for the dip
On a 100 and 8th and keep mashin'
Don't drink and drive to keep the fo' from crashin'
Stashin' a glock and I thought you knew it
Fool, you know how we do it
And you can't fade the R E M I X
Goin' to the bank cashin' big fat checks
What's next on the menu?
Got a big fat booty to attend to, ooh
With the rhythm it takes to dance to
But we got to live too
Mobbin' and robbin' and squabbin' and stealin'
K-Dee and me, I got the feelin'
And won't be happy 'til I'm platinum loc'
The mic smoke and all the hoes are broke
The freshest MC in the world, who is?
You is, you know how we do it
Fool, you know how we do it
It's hittin' on the West Side
It's bumpin' on the East Side
Slammin' on the South Side
Makin' noise on the North Side
Ain't nuttin' goin on but the bomb-ass rap song
Ain't nuttin' goin on but the bomb-ass rap song
Ain't nuttin' goin on but the bomb-ass rap song
Ain't nuttin' goin on but the bomb-ass rap song
