Get that ass up Scream Double R
We ain't going nowhere we made it this far
Let me see my, my dogs
Let me hear my, my dogs
Get that ass up scream double R
We ain't goin' nowhere we made it this far
We ain't goin' nowhere we made it this far
Let me see my, my dogs
Let me hear my, my dogs
Uh, what, uh, my baby
My, baby, that's my baby come on
Time to hit y'all cats with another joint from Eve and the dog
And you know how we do baby creep in the fog
Now hold it down for the fellas, hold it down for the girls
Keep motherfuckers know this rap shit is our world
Been there and done that, had fun where the run at
Don't got to shoot a motherfucker no more so put the gun back
Pay niggas to do that, 'cause they a lot better at it
Keep the burner in the truck 'cause well you got to have it
It's an unwritten law
Let a faggot open that fordidden door
Hit 'em with four hairline to the jaw
That's what I'm aimin' at
We going to get that nigga X aight well keep saying that
Eve I wish you the best and I'll always love you
Never hear me say fuck you because I love you
Always here for you when somebody else is not
A dog and his bitch blowing up the spot
Come on
Get that ass up scream double R
We ain't going nowhere we made it this far
We ain't going nowhere we made it this far
Let me see my, my dogs
Let me hear my, my dogs
Get that ass up scream double R
We ain't going nowhere we made it this far
We ain't going nowhere we made it this far
Let me see my, my dogs
Let me hear my, my dogs
It should be against the law, me and the dog like a brawl
And the only thing that can help you is God and you should call on him
Weak sight, the streets like, you creep like
'Cause they got each other's she bark and he bite
It ain't strange you cats know the name
Double R scream it bubble hard it's a shame
Realest niggas doing it, them clowns they ruin it
Shut 'em down give 'em pounds 'cause palms got glue in it
Sticky finger niggas steal each other's style
Claiming how they started things not original
Cats they get caught up in the glitter and glam
If that's the case you should be considered a fan
I'm like tired of the same beats they claim streets
Doin' nothin' but duckin' from the hood got the same speech
Only one you feeling is you niggas know the deal
Industry, fuck it, in the streets keep it real, nigga
Get that ass up scream double R
We ain't going nowhere we made it this far
Let me see my, my dogs
Let me hear my, my dogs
Get that ass up scream double R
We ain't going nowhere we made it this far
We ain't going nowhere we made it this far
Let me see my, my dogs
Let me hear my, my dogs
Since the beginning we both knew we was winning
'Cause we been in all type of shit  but kept on spittin', hittin'
Niggas in the head with that shit that let 'em know it was the truth
So they feel that 'cause it's real black
We never going to stop, no matter what they say
No matter what they do
They can't never take it away
What the Lord give you let no man curse
E V E and D M X from the birth to the earth
Why they sick 'cause we still close thought that it was over
Cats trying to tear us apart dogs got closer
All the shit we deal with only make us stronger
Try to do a lot of shit but they can't belong to
For real niggas scared of us, steady catching them bluffing
What you say shut up nigga saying much of nothing
Act like they don't want it but they demand it
Double R keep it hard and niggas can't stand it
Get that ass up and scream double R
We ain't going nowhere we made it this far
We ain't going nowhere we made it this far
Let me see my, my dogs
Let me hear my, my dogs
Get that ass up and scream double R
We ain't going nowhere we made it this far
We ain't going nowhere we made it this far
Let me see my, my dogs
Let me hear my, my dogs
Get that ass up and scream double R
We ain't going nowhere we made it this far
We ain't going nowhere we made it this far
Let me see my, my dogs
Let me hear my, my dogs
