Muthafuckin' murderer
Bitch, yo, killed my sister
Bitch, I'm 'bout to get my pistol
Know that I'm comin' and I gotta get him
And I gotta kill him and cease all his stupid shit
And walk with this venomous shit
'Cuz she's 'sposed to be there for me
Six years, still tears
I know it's gonna be that way
Until the day that your grave is filled up
I still can't forget'cha 'cuz all you did is spilled blood
Bitch that was my only sister, you can't just kill her
Don't that fuck with you, [unverified], can't you feel her?
That's what the fuck she get for givin' you her real love [unverified]
I tried to play cool and mind my business, and stay out it
I was supposed to be all in, when it comes to your family
Share your problems
I just wish I would've knew then what I know now
I just wish I could've woke up before it went down
Now I'm sayin', "Damn", wake up hollerin', "Damn"
Wait until I get that muthafucka, and I am
Murder, murder, murder
Murder, murder, murder
(Get that muthafucka what I tell myself)
Murderer
Murderer
Murder, murder, murder
Murder, murder, murder
(Get that muthafucka what I tell myself)
Murderer
Murderer
Now, why?
Would you come to my house, tell the truth
Then turn around and be 'bout lyin' [unverified]
Muthafucka in that water
I know you didn't want your son to rot
So if you gone support him
Then you can jump up in the skillet with him and fry
Bitch, my goddamn sister used to call you mama
And this is how you honor her [unverified]
I'm furious and to her I say murderer
Her loyalty and her love, you deserted her
Changed the whole story and got on the evening news and shined
The bitch start actin', got on the witness stand and start cryin'
Now who the fuck you think you foolin'? Or convincin'?
It must be your fuckin' self
It hurt me so bad, to avoid doin' somethin' crazy
I had to write this shit down on paper
And show you what the fuck I felt
You disgrace me, it's a show of shame,
You saw that look in my sister face, she died in pain
Murder, murder, murder
Murder, murder, murder
(Get that muthafucka what I tell myself)
Murderer
Murderer
Murder, murder, murder
Murder, murder, murder
(Get that muthafucka what I tell myself)

Thou shalt not kill
Bitch, I can remember finishin' the argument
That y'all was havin' over automobiles
Thou shalt not lie
I know what you did, I'm comin' to get'cha
You cannot live
Look, you sleep forever is the fuckin' price
Shit, a throat for a throat, a life for a life
Fuck my feelings, you owe that to my family and her son
My children auntie ain't there, fuckin', well right I got a grudge
On your Ma, and her lawyer, and the courts
And the jurors and the judge
Defenses, your immediate family members
I'm pissin' on it and burnin' the district attorney
You stepped down on us
Shipped that coward out his fuckin' cell
And let him skip town on us just like that
And I guess I'm 'sposed to let that shit go down, ha?
Just like that, I'm makin' it happen to these actors
My screwdriver and my telephone bar
And my black hat on backwards
Takin' your boyfriend, that's how it end
But until then, I'm livin' for revenge
Murder, murder, murder
Murder, murder, murder
(Get that muthafucka what I tell myself)
Murderer
Murderer
Murder, murder, murder
Murder, murder, murder
(Get that muthafucka what I tell myself)

Bitch you killed my sister
