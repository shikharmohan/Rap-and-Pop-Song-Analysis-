I'm so glad that you believe in me like I believe in you
This love's exactly how I picture
It's such a joy when I receive all that I need in you
We're flowing smooth just like a river
Express my true when, I make love to you
Just like that day back in September
If we might run in some problems, I know you'll see me through
There's nothing for you I won't do 'cause I believe in you
Oh I believe in you
And I believe in you too
See can't nobody make me do what you do
I mean I'm so in love with you
I never thought a girl could make me
Take me to a whole new world
Re-shape me, love me, hate me
Lately we ain't been fussing or fighting
You play all day and I be working at night and
The only one who understands my life and
The cake and the icing these other girls
In the world live their life so trifling
I couldn't do it no more I had to sit you down
And make you my wife
And cold thing but you know it's a cold gain
It's so real I had to bless you with my last name
Slowed me down, straight took me out the fast lane
Hold me down come on baby watch me do this thing
I been crowned king so I guess that means you're my queen
You have my seeds let's go ahead and raise this team
It's so special you're all I ever need
I'm feeling good and my baby's home
You're spending time holding hands to this beat
The fellow that can satisfy my every need, is he the one?
We've been around and we're both grown
Look at me, I'm like a baby I took that chance
And I feel secure about this love romance, let's have some fun
And I believe when you say ain't that special, touch my soul
Feel the same when you whisper softly and call my name here I come
It's more than words that I ever could sing you're that chill bring
Maybe your walk or just the way you do me
I really think we are the two 'cause I believe in you
Take a second realize we can make it if you
Don't stop come on boy we about to take it to the top
I know you're gonna love what you're about to see
Do you believe in me?
We can make it all night long baby if we
Don't stop come on boy you know you got me so hot
I know I'm gonna love what you're about to do
'Cause I believe in you, I believe in you
And I believe in you too 'cause it's the right thing to do
And I believe in you too 'cause it's the only thing to do
I couldn't give you away no matter what my friends sizzay
See when I'm gone away from home I'm alone every dizzay
I left a gang of messages for you on your two way
But you ain't hollered back but you know how, you play
You say, okay I say, no way we got to be together forever
And a dizzay 'cause I believe in you
Take a second realize we can make it if we don't stop
Come on boy we about to take it to the top
I know you're gonna love what you're about to see
Do you believe in me?
We can make it all night long baby if we
Don't stop come on boy you know you got me so hot
I know I'm gone love what you're about to do
'Cause I believe in you
I'm so glad that you believe in me like I believe in you
This love's exactly how I picture
It's such a joy when I receive all that I need in you
We're flowing smooth just like a river
Express my true when, I make love to you
Just like that day back in September
If we might run in some problems, I know you'll see me through
There's nothing for you I won't do
'Cause I believe in you, oh I believe in you
