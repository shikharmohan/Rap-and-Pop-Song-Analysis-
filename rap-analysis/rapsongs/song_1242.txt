[Barron Ricks]
My flows most beneficent, most merciful, outrageous
for wages, vibrate niggaz heads like pagers
Too hard to handle son, we animals, biohazardous
Ghetto evangelist, lyric distortions, abortions
of fortune shit, shittin on your ASR-10 Sequence
Fuckin up the disc
These be the words blow niggaz acoustic nerves
when I swerve I'm bustin adjectives and verbs at curves
Hear the thunder then I melt the frozen tundra, sank Titanics
Crack solid granite, initiate global panic
Harlem got me branded, rhythms jingle like bricks
These niggaz face it or face off, give up or break North
My lines petrify your mind's third eye, when I'm high
I pull the trey in your insides, I strike blindside
Rip inside, my syllables simmer for every criminal
in prison whose an individual lose that struggle
My stories burst niggaz bubbles, make new niggaz mumble
Ready to shed blood up in the jungles
Aiyyo we livin it, magnficent
Cypress, worldwide!
[B-Real]
I take the micraphone cord, use it as a rope
to hang all the weak rappers for leavin the bullshit they wrote
Counterfeit fools all in the pot, let em boil
When we go platinum they go, aluminum foil
The worldwide clicks and the parties with no parties
Cause niggaz'll get you quickly like the skin off a blunt
when they get burned and smoked, put out and used up
Niggaz don't know how to act when they lit the fuse up
Abuse them up, usin the nut, I'm usin buck
Fearin of the shit, that's covered the script, deliver cuts
Cypress Hill, Soul Asassins, all up in the club
Showin love to everyone of you real niggaz
Cause the hip-hop's pumpin through the blood in my veins
like a junkie, fuckin with 'ron and cocaine
Slay you both down, better hold down or get clowned
by the world renowned, Cypress compound!
[Chace Infinite]
Heavy artillery rap niggaz attack from both sides
of the map, leave you flat on your back, my thoughts dwell
in the dark black abyss, Chace Infinite kicks
rhymes over rhythm and spit hot flame from his lips
I represent, the cream of the earth, bless his birth
My order in the elements in the universe
My mental enter your physical frame, penetrate
like pushin your face straight through a window pane
with twenty bars, I'm sinister God, administer pain
to your paragraph it ain't hard, see I studied the life-science
for years in this, doin songs with my indigineous
peers n shit, hit you with the omnipotent gland
The benficient stare, write a rhyme to shine light
in your ear, don't make a move that'll end your career
Stand clear, I stand firm on solid ground
Pump Blood Sweat and Tears, verbal architect, engineer
Shiftin your ear, to Cypress Hill, you wack niggaz
caps is peeled, the scientific Soul Asassin
We dominate tracks and thrash in the front lines
Soldier ready for action, rapid fire rappin
