Oh bitch I'm country as cowboy boots
High debut beating boy band groups
Nigga let me know what the fuck y'all want do
Either keep up or you can't, can't
Met 'em through a barbeque, cracker through yo' thang, thang
I ain't come here for no dumb shit
You think you one of the hardest nigga, lyrics of the drum kick
When it's finished over and done with
I'ma smoke a blunt and knock the pussy off of some bitch
I ain't no speedy when you say I beat it too much
I ain't gone eat it, you ready go drown me and I pound it enough
See me losin' fuck the big butt women
Woman walkin' funny pussy up in her stomach
Sittin' in the front 'cause TV's runnin'
Peanut-butter leather seat, with big truck on it
I must've kidnapped the nigga man-huntin'
'Cause I heard 'em hollain' hold on baby I'm comin'
Far away the stars, never thought we would get this far
But bitch I told, do what you're spoused to
Give me brains, stop lookin' strange fix your jeans
It's just like I told you, walk like I'm spoused to
Man I'm the only mother-fuckin' black prince of the south
So ba-ba-balubop, bitch watch out
I make yo' momma sake a tell feather
Don't tell yo' daddy that I'm here, 'cause you know I make him feel great
Gone get yo' sex, you just turn me on
While he down there quotin bed, I know you not gone sing that song
I hit the chart enough to move off, my homie cool off
Before you knows [Incomprehensible] 1:40
I give it to him and this bitch can't handle
Or ugly jealous mother-fucker this shit jammin'
Ridiculous amounts of raw uncut talent
On top of 8th street kicks Indiana
No callin' me big bucks no wammies
This year I'm screamin' jive records big truck goddamn it
Heads up high enough so you can move
Rank CEO slash rapper, slash fool
Far away the stars, never thought we would get this far
But bitch I told, do what you're spoused to
Give me brains, stop lookin' strange fix your jeans
It's just like I told you, walk like I'm spoused to
I'm fixin' to blow up like the jar of [Incomprehensible] 2:21
Ever the vesent [Incomprehensible] 2:24 come get me
Grammy nominated, especially
The soul train award winner, call me black elvis Presly
You probably [Incomprehensible] 2:30 but you see me on
Either 106 and Park, Queen Latifah, Chris rock, or Jenny Jones
Knock down buildin's, chop down trees
I kick so fuckin' hard they say, "You Japanese"
I'm up in the minute because of what I invent
Look at your over there with your seatbelt
Like I'm [Incomprehensible] 2:44
A.K.A the tarantula, hot rhymes comin' from a cannista'
They keepin' my fan for somethin' to brag on
These people in here ain't leavin' 'til I finish my fuckin' last song
Bitch walk like a balberin', tall dark and cut
Now keep your fuckin' hoes down
Far away the stars, never thought we would get this far
But bitch I told, do what you're spoused to
Give me brains, stop lookin' strange fix your jeans
It's just like I told you, walk like I'm spoused to
Far away the stars, never thought we would get this far
But bitch I told, do what you're spoused to
Give me brains, stop lookin' strange fix your jeans
It's just like I told you, walk like I'm spoused to
South and west come together
However, we plan doing this shit quite clever
My nigga mystikal, it's ya boy butch cass'
And we put a foot off in they ass let's have a blast
