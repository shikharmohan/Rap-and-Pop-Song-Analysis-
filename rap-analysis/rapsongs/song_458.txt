[Eazy-E]
Woke up this mornin' fifty-five past six
Eazy-muthafuckin-E with tha hard ass dick
Nigga plottin', ahhhh
Nigga schemin'so don't wake me bitch 'cause i'm dreamin
1-8-7s on bitches in my head, nigga up snorin' like fuck, sleep in fear
Cock my nine, and i'm out the window
Drunk as fuck and high off that indo
Nigga E, C-P-T, the O.G.
And i really don't think u wanna fuck with me
Nigga walkin half up with nine in hand
I gives a mad fuck but they don't understand
I wet 'em up, wet 'em up, wet 'em up
Now back to the mutha fuckin set, creepin crawlin crawlin creepin
Don't get caught sleepin
[Layzie]
Sleepwalkin stalkin runnin with the guage up under this murderous spell now
Consider me hellbound, crossin my path, i'ma drop this 12-guage shell down
On the road to destruction, guage eruption, creepin so i'm cautious
Catch a nigga sleep, six feet deep 
and scopin out peepin cause ya be makin me nauseous
Deeper than a ocean man, hitttin you with this potion man
Death runnin up from the left, Bang!
