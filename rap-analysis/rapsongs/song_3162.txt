For you wreck yo self
'Cause I'm bad for your health

Sold it for six-o, always let tricks know
And friends know, we got that indoe
Yo, I'm not a sucka sittin' in a house of pain
And no I'm not the butler, i'll cut ya head-butt ya
You say you can't touch this
And I wouldn't touch ya, punk motherfucker
Here to let you know boy, oh boy

Yo, common, chick-ity-check yo self
Before you wreck yo self
'Cause shotgun bullets
Are bad for your health
Tricks wanna step to cube and then they get played
'Cause they bitch may pullin out a switchblade
That's kinda trifle
'Cause that's a knife-o AK-47 assault rifle
Hold the fifty, I' nifty now
Gotta a new style, watch out now
I hate motherfuckers
Claimin' that they foldin'
Bank but steady talkin shit in the holdin'
Tank first you wanna step to me
Now your ass screamin' for the deputy
They send you to Charlie-Baker-Denver row
Now the runnin' up in ya slow
You're God, used to be the Don Juan
Now your name is just Twan
Switch it, snap it, rollin your eyes and neck
You better run a check
So chick-ity-check yo self
Before you wreck yo self
Come on an' chick-ity-check yo self
Before you wreck yo self
So  chick-ity-check yo self
Before you wreck yo self
Big dicks in ya ass is bad for your health
Come, yeah
If you're foul
You better run a make on that license plate
You coulda had a V8
Instead of a trey-eight slug to ya cranium
I got six and I'm aimin' em
Will I bust or keep you guessin'
'Cause fuck you and that shit ya stressin'
Bitch, get off the wood, you no good
There goes the neighborhood hooker
Go ahead and keep your drawers
Givin' up the claps and who needs applause
At a time like this, pop ya coochie and ya dead
Bitch is a Miami hurricane head
Sprung, niggas call her lips and lungs
Nappy dugout, get the fuck out
'Cause women like you gets no respect
Bitch, you better run a check
So chick-ity-check yo self

Sometimes it makes me wonder
How I keep from goin' under?
