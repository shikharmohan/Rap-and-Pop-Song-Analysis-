Yeah, be the realest shit I never wrote
I ain't write this shit by the way, nigga
Some real shit right here, nigga
This will be the realest shit you ever quote
My president is black, my Lambo's blue
And I be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My momma ain't at home and daddy still in jail
Tryna make a plate, anybody seen the scale?
My president is black, my Lambo's blue
And I be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My money's light green and my Jordan's light gray
And they love to see white, now how much you tryna pay, let's go
Today was a good day, hope I have me a great night
I dunno what you fishin' for, hope you catch you a great white
Need I say great white, heavy as killer whales
I cannot believe this, who knew it came in bails?
Who knew it came with jail, who knew it came with prison?
Just 'cause you got an opinion does that make you a politician?
Bush robbed all of us, would that make him a criminal?
And then he cheated in Florida, would that make him a Seminole?
I say and I quote, we need a miracle
And I say a miracle 'cause this shit is hysterical
But my nephews and nieces, I will email Jesus
Tell him forward to Moses and cc: Allah
Mr. Soul Survivor does that make me a Konvict?
'Be all you can be', now, don't that sound like some dumb shit
When you dogged with crude oil as black as my nigga boo
It's really a Desert Storm, that's word to my nigga Clue
Catch me in Las Vegas, A.R. Arizona
Rep for them real niggaz, I'm winnin' in California
Winnin' in Tennessee, hands down Atlanta
Landslide Alabama, on my way to Savannah
My president is black, my Lambo's blue
And I be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My momma ain't at home and daddy still in jail
Tryna make a plate, anybody seen the scale?
My president is black, my Lambo's blue
And I be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My money's light green and my Jordan's light gray
And they love to see white, now how much you tryna pay, let's go
I said I woke up this morning, headache this big
Pay all these damn bills, feed all these damn kids
Buy all these school shoes, buy all these school clothes
For some strange reason my son addicted to Polo's
Mommies a spinach dip, I'm addicted to use Houston's
And if the numbers is right, I take a trip out to Houston
A earthquake out in China, a hurricane in New Orleans
Street Dreams Tour, I sold my ass in New Orleans
Did it for Soulja Slim, brought out B.G.
It's all love from the beginnin' you Pimp C
You know how the pimp be, that nigga gon' speak his mind
If he could speak down from heaven, he tell me stay on my grind
Tell him I'm doin' fine, Obama for mankind
We ready for damn change, so y'all let the man shine
Stuntin' on Martin Luther 'cause I'm feelin' just like a king
Guess this is what he meant when he said that he had a dream
My president is black, my Lambo's blue
And I be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My momma ain't at home and daddy still in jail
Tryna make a plate, anybody seen the scale?
My president is black, my Lambo's blue
And I be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My money's light green and my Jordan's light gray
And they love to see white, now how much you tryna pay, let's go
Our history, black history, no president ever did shit for me
Had to hit the streets, had to flip some keys, so a nigga won't go broke
Then he put us in jail, now, a nigga can't go vote
So I spend dough on these hoes is strippin'
She ain't a politician honeys a polotician
My president is black, Rolls golden charms
22 inch rims like Hulk Hogan's arms
When thousands of peoples is riled up to see you
That can arouse ya ego, you got mouths to feed
So gotta stay true to who you are and where you came from
'Cause at the top will be the same place you hang from
No matter how big you could ever be
For whatever fee or publicity, never lose your integrity
For years there's been surprise horses in this stable
Just two albums in, I'm the realest nigga on this label
Mr. Black President, yeah Obama for real
They gotta put ya face on the 5000 dollar bill
My president is black, my Lambo's blue
And I be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My momma ain't at home and daddy still in jail
Tryna make a plate, anybody seen the scale
My president is black, my Lambo's blue
And I be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My money's light green and my Jordan's light gray
And they love to see white, now how much you tryna pay, let's go
So I'm sittin' here right now man, it's June 3rd, 2:08 a.m.
Nigga, I won't say win, lose or draw man
We congratulate you already homie
See I motivate the thugs right, you motivate us homie
That's what it is, this a hands on policy
Ya'll touchin' me right nigga, yeah, first black president
Win, lose or draw nigga, matter of fact, you know what it is, man
Shouts out Jackie Robinson, Booker T Washington homie
Oh y'all ain't think I knew that shit, Sidney Poitier, what they do
My president is black, I'm important too though
