He's still right here shorty, told you I got you
Like the way I scooped you when them faggot niggaz shot you?
I'ma hold you down and I mean that, for real
But everytime you beef with a nigga, I end up havin' to kill
It ain't like that and hey, forget about them two kids
'Bout to get a deal and it's as nice as you is
Oh, you think?
Nah, I'm just playin', whassup?
Got some new bitches, I know you tryin' to fuck
Not really
What? I ain't your man no more?
Just because a nigga, don't need a hand no more?
You know how we do, if one goes soft
We all take the pussy and go up in her raw
It's like now, where you goin', I ain't tryin' to take it
Fuckin' with a nigga like you, I won't make it
It'll be what it is
Yo, you in for the night?
I'm 'bout to take it to the crib
You get home aight?
The snake
(The snake)

The cat and the dog
How you gonna live
When you're in the fog?
The snake
(The snake)

(The rat)
The cat and the dog
How you gonna live
When you're in the fog?
Yo, I ain't fuckin' with this nigga no more, word to my mother
Fuck it, so you know I'm for sure, word to my brother
It's like he's gotten worse than before, somehow I wonder
What type of dirt this nigga got in store for me to get under?
Then I get the call, yo
X, police just killed your cousin, underneath the projects
Don't get vexed, niggaz'll pay, 'member I got you
Told you I got you, yo, I got you
I'm in a catch twenty two, but them niggaz got to pay
But I know he gon' be askin' for a favor one day
But fuck it, I ain't got no choice in the matter
Them faggots killed my peoples and I wanna see 'em splattered
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout, we ain't on no kid shit
And I'ma use the same gun that you killed them two kids with
Is that hard to live with?
Nah
See, you still a playa
But what you want from me?
Ahh, I'll tell you later
The snake
(The snake)
The rat
(The rat)
The cat and the dog
How you gonna live
When you're in the fog?
The snake
(The snake)
The rat
(The rat)
The cat and the dog
How you gonna live
When you're in the fog?
Shit is all over the news, bomb goes off in Central
What the fuck have I gotten myself into?
The mental, is like, "Get the fuck outta there"
I'm out
Hey, goin' somewhere? Nah
What the bag for?
Fuck it, what you want?
Can your nigga come inside, for a minute, and puff a blunt?
Here we go again
After what I just gave you
Wasn't actin' like that, when you asked for that favor?
Yo, I ain't ask you for shit
Oh yes you did
When you really needed somethin' and you allowed me to give
You sold me your soul when you didn't say no
Just let a nigga go and gimme what you owe
Fuck was you thinkin'?  Ain't shit for free
Ain't a motherfucker you know, can defeat me
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned
And with your help, I know, the Devil won't win
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill
Take you all on our way to hell
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill
We're gon' do do it, do it well
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill
Take you all on our way to hell
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill
We don't want to do it, we do it well
