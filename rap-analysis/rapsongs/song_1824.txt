Who's afraid of the dark? Responsible for the murders in the park
When I bark, they hear the boom but you see the spark
And I seen the part of your head which used to be your face
Was replaced by nothin' for bluffin', what a waste
Niggaz wanna see me taste my own medicine
Picture that, get on some old second grade shit, I'ma get you back
Retaliate, if it hates for you to think I took a loss
When all I did was shook it off, yeah, you heard me, shook it off
Man, if we was up north, niggaz would have been fucked you
But then we in the streets, niggaz should haven been stuck you
Plucked you like a chicken wit' your head cutoff
They'll find you wit' your back open and your legs cutoff
And as for your man, don't you ever in your mutherfuckin' life
Know when I gotta gun come at me wit' a knife?
And forgettin' you ever saw me is the best thing to do
Don't give a fuck about your family, they'll be resting with you

You got yourself in a predicament, that you can't get out of
You already in some shit but it's about to get hotter
Fuckin' wit' a, nigga like you, runnin' your mouth
Will, have that same nigga like you, gun in your mouth
But won't be like the last time when you run in the house
'Cuz I ain't knockin' on the door
I'm comin' in the house and I'm gunnin' for your spouse
Tryin' to send the bitch back to her maker
And if you got a daughter older then 15, I'ma rape her
Take her on the living room floor, right there in front of you
Then ask you seriously, whatchu wanna do?
Frustratin', isn't it? When they kill me, but I'ma kill you
Now watch me fuck just a lil' while longer, please, will you?
This is revenge, no time before you die
And despite how much I hate to see a grown man cry
I'ma make you suffer, see your ass in hell, motherfucker
Click, boom, boom, see your ass in hell
1, 2, X is comin' for you

When I speak you better listen, the harder it gets, the more follows
And I'm hittin' 'em wit' shit that they can't all swallow
I keep my slugs hollow, keep families with sorrow
Keep motherfuckers like you, not seein' tomorrow
I will borrow a gun, then run 'til I catch you
Let you slip up, just once then I'ma wet you
Stretch you out like a limousine
'Cuz where I catch you is where I catch you, that's what killin' means
Fuck whoever's standin' there when you get what you got comin'
'Cuz once I hit you in your head, the witnesses start runnin'
Niggaz started somethin' but they chose not to finish it
So I'ma wrap it up, for real, dog, 'cuz I'ma winner, shit
Fuck it yo, let's end this shit, I don't need the plaques
And I ain't a DJ, nigga, so I don't need the wax
Gimme slugs from my gats
Gimme hoods from my rats
Gimme wood from my bats
Then they meet where the fuck I'm at, for real
1, 2, X is comin' for you
