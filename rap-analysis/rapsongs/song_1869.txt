Like the wind
(Like the wind)
God will take
(God will take)
All my sins
(All of my sins)
Blown away
(Will be blown away)
Like the wind, like the wind blow
  (Yes)
Yea, uh, from 80 school street to way across town
Cats knew how I got down 'cause word got around
I was that robbery kid with no gun and no mask
Catch a nigga out the door slippin', that's yo ass
Didn't laugh much 'cause I didn't have much
Life was like a stick, half gas, half clutch
Meaning half good and half bad
It was good if I caught a good vic, if I didn't, I was bad
Took it out on my regulars, I come through
And if niggaz was broke, I took watches and sneakers
Went to jail a few times but that didn't stop me
All it taught me was, how not to be sloppy
An older cat robbed me when I was like ten
If anybody wanted to help, they should've did it then
But they didn't and all it did was release the beast
So I'ma feast on whatever I come across in the streets
Like the wind
(Like the wind)
God will take
(God will take)
All my sins
(All of my sins)
Blown away
(Will be blown away)
Like the wind
(Like the wind)
Like the wind, blown
(Like the wind)
I had a "S" on my chest, fuck the vest
Did robberies with some cats and robbed the rest
Other times, I came through with just me and my dog
We'd clear out the whole fuckin' block 'cause we went hard
I bag some niggaz I knew and some niggaz I didn't
I ain't a fuck either way, it was no bullshittin'
I'm a cruddy nigga out to get money
And a couple of slugs is the only thing anybody took from me
Run up on a cat smooth like, put it in his left ear
Give up the money, the jewelry or get left here
Keep thinking it's a game and play, let's get popped
See how much fun you having, when your heart be stopped
Shut 'em down, open up shop, blow off a nigga top
Somebody call the cops, but it's too late
'Cause I'm a hit you in the face
And what will kill you will be somethin' that you ate
Like the wind
(Like the wind)
God will take
(God will take)
All my sins
(All of my sins)
Blown away
(Will be blown away)
Like the wind
(Like the wind)
Like the wind, blown
(Like the wind)
If pain is love, why hide my pain with drugs?
Choke off haze and sell attics coke for days
Same clothes, no soap to shave
And I still got a gun on my hip for your open grave
We used to get robbery vics
Until my man got killed for his whip on some robbery shit
Then I switched to the weed and started sellin' crack
But I will pull a steel and put a shell up in ya back
I feel like all my life, I was held up in a trap
Like if I go to heaven, maybe hell will want me back
But all I really want is [Incomprehensible]
And a model bitch sitting with a head up in my lap
But since no doe, don't spin
And my pant's hole got hole within, I got to fold 'em in
It's obvious, I live in a house of sin
I wish I could open up the doors and let 'em blow at the wind
Like the wind God will take
All my sins, blown away
Like the wind, like the wind blown
Like the wind, like the wind, like the wind blown
