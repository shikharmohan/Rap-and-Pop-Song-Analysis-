Earl Simmons A.K.A the dawg gettin' down for real and goin' hard
('Cause it's all goin' on in my life)
This is my life and I'm livin' it how I wanna live it
Motherfuckers won't you fuckin' come and get it
(Come on)
('Cause it's all goin' on in my life)
Check it out yo, give me at least three feet
Or end up stinkin' leakin' in the street
(What?)
('Cause it's all goin' on in my life)
I wanna be able to teach you blood
Wanna be able to sit down and eat with you 'cuz
('Cause it's all goin' on in my life)

You should be glad to have the worst statute
('Cause it's all goin' on in my life)
(Get up)
There it is my dreams my fears
My words that constantly fall on deaf ears

('Cause it's all goin' on in my life)
Forgive me father for I have sinned
