Yo, it's a beautiful day, and everybody's feelin' wonderful
The ladies is out, lookin' fly, dressed comfortable
I love to wake up and feel the breeze through my window
Slip on a fatigues, grab a dutch and roll some indo
It be days like these that make life so much easier
Fish thawin' out, Guinness Stout in the freezer
Walk the block at my leisure
(My leisure)
Summertime is like a anesthesia, so many pretty things to please ya
The greenery, beautiful birds, natural scenery or even just a infinite sky
We be forever puffin' lah on the block
Or tellin' jokes in the ride
(Ha ha ha)
When the weather be hot, everybody be outside
(Whut)
Havin' fun, eatin' fresh fruits and vegetables
(Aight?)
And good food put me in the mood for a festival
Some say the summer make a woman more sexual
(S'up, boo)
It's instinct, that's why my game be right on schedule
I put the great Mother Nature on a pedestal
She always fly, but today, she's exceptional
If I had a chance to make a wish
Every day would be just like this, full of happiness
I feel great even though we got mad things to deal with
Happiness is all in the mind
Let's unwind, and find a reason to smile
I'm just glad to be livin', feelin' fine
Leavin' my bad times behind
Feels great and no, we can't escape from the realness
Happiness is all in the mind
Let's unwind, and find a reason to smile
I'm just glad to be alive, feelin' fine
Livin' life one day at a time
Feelin' great
Yeah, knaw'msayin'?
I just wanna give a shout out
To everybody who got a birthday today
Happiness
(Happiness)
Have you ever heard the children play?
Sometime, I feel the same way, roll up a J
And get away, put some food on the grill
And just chill, maybe build with my elders
(Uh)
Never know the things they could tell ya
Learnin' why the caged bird sings
(Why it do that?)
'Cuz it's the vital things you know
That separate the men from the Kings
The flowers that bloom and the Sun
(Uh)
And everybody singin' the tune 'cuz it's time to have fun
We out, rollerbladin' a day where no one coulda stayed inside
(Uh, uh)
Wash the car, now it's time to take a ride
Me and my crew hangin' out, all night to sunrise
Celebration of life 'cuz every day is a surprise
Think of the rich countryside on the land of Jamaica
Mountains, springs and green acres
Or any other place in the world your mind takes you
It's the good times in life that everybody can relate to
(Uh)
And you can leave your troubles behind and have a wonderful time
Lay back and just ease your mind
(Whut)
You can leave your troubles behind and have a wonderful time
Lay back and just ease your mind
I feel great even though we got mad things to deal with
Happiness is all in the mind
Let's unwind, and find a reason to smile
I'm just glad to be livin', feelin' fine
Leavin' my bad times behind
Feels great and no, we can't escape from the realness
Happiness is all in the mind
Let's unwind, and find a reason to smile
I'm just glad to be alive, feelin' fine
Livin' life one day at a time
Feelin' great
Yeah, knaw'msayin'?
I just wanna give a shout out
To everybody who got a birthday today
