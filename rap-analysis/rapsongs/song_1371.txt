Verse 1: (Beyonce)
Now that you are out of my life I'm so much better
You thought that I'd be weak without you, but I'm stronger
You thought that I'd be broke without you, but I'm richer
You thought that I'd be sad without you I laugh harder
You thought I wouldn't grow without you now I'm wiser
You thought that I'd be helpless without you, but I'm smarter
You thought that I'd be stressed without ya, but I'm chillin'
You thought I wouldn't sell without ya sold 9 million
Chorus:
I'm a survivor (what), I'm not gonna give up (what)
I'm not gon stop (what), I'm gonna work harder (what)
I'm a survivor (what), I'm gonna make it (what)
I'm a survivor (what), keep on survivin' (what)
Verse 2: (Beyonce)
Thought I couldn't breath without ya I'm inhalin
You thought I couldn't see without ya perfect vision
You thought I couldn't last without ya, but I'm lastin
You thought that I would die without ya but I'm livin'
thought that i would fail w/o ya but I'm on top
thought that it would be over by now but it won't stop
thought that i would self destruct but I'm still here
even in my years to come I'm still gonna be here
Chorus:
I'm a survivor I'm not gonna give up
I'm not gon stop I'm gonna work harder
I a survivor I'm gonna make it
I'm a survivor keep on survivin
(Kelly)
I'm wishin you the best, pray that you are blessed
much success, no stress and lots of happiness
I'm better than that
I'm not gon blast you on the radio 
I'm better than that
I'm not gon lie on you or yo family yo
I'm better than that
I'm not gon hate on you in the magazine
I'm better than that
I'm not gon compromise my Christianity
I'm better than that
You know I'm not gonna diss you on the internet
cause my mama taught me better than that
Chorus:
(BeyoncÃÂ© and Michelle)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
(Michelle)
after all of the darkness and sadness soon comes happiness
if i surround myself with positive things I'll gain posterity
chorus to the end
