It's just a fly love song, what?
It's just a fly love song, what?
Are we livin' in a dream world?
Are your eyes still green, girl?
I know you're sick an' tired of arguin'
But you can't keep it bottled in
Jealousy, we got to swallow it
Your heart an' mind, baby, follow it
Smile, happiness, you could model it
An' when you feel opposite
I just want you to know
Your whole being is beautiful
I'ma do the best I can do
'Cause I'm the best when I'm with you
Come close to me, baby
Let your love hold you
I know this world gets crazy
What's it without you?
Put down your bags, love
I know in the past, love
Has been sort of hard on you
But I see the God in you
I just wanna nurture it
Though this love may hurt a bit
We dealin' wit this water, love
You even give my daughter love
I wanna build a tribe wit you
Protect an' provide for you
Truth is I can't hide from you
The pimp in me, may have to die with you
Come close to me, baby
Let your love hold you
I know this world gets crazy
What's it without you?
I know what you're thinkin', you're on my mind
An' you're right, you're right, you're right
You promise so fast, you just might take flight
Hope you're not tired tonight, tonight
You help me to discovery me
I just want you to put trust in me
I kinda laugh when you cuss at me
The aftermath is you touchin' me
It's destiny that we connected, girl
You an' I, we can affect the world
I'm tired of the fast lane
I want you to have my last name
Come close to me, baby
Let your love hold you
I know this world gets crazy
What's it without you?
I know what you're thinkin', you're on my mind
An' you're right, you're right, you're right
You promise so fast, you just might take flight
Hope you're not tired tonight, tonight
I know what you're thinkin', you're on my mind
An' you're right, you're right, you're right
You promise so fast, you just might take flight
Hope you're not tired tonight, tonight
I know what you're thinkin', you're on my mind
An' you're right
You promise so fast, you just might take flight
I know what you're thinkin', you're on my mind
An' you're right, you're right, you're right
You promise so fast, you just might take flight
Hope you're not tired
