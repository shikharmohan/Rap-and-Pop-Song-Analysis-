I love is old school like Mary Jane
Boston baked beans and candy canes
Exchanged look on a number two train
Run catch kiss sunshine or rain
Jackson 5, Good Times and Jefferson
Yeah baby, you know I liked it better when
You lived closer but then you moved
But that couldn't stop our groove
My magic man, my Brooklyn boy wonder
I rub your shoulders the pressure you was under
Late night rides after sunrise
Catch a flick or two and then back to bed side
You in the bubblegoose me in the sheep skin
Cold as hell back when it wasn't matterin
Long as we were hand in hand you were my man
And I'm your girl faith in all the world
[Chorus]:
This is for all the years you've been
My companion as well as my best friend
So tonight babe I'm givin you
What you wants it's all yours
[Chorus 1x in the background]
Our love is like a Romeo and Juliet film
So surreal but yet picturesque
There were problems I can admit it
But we handled it and still the candles lit
So glad that we didn't just end it
Cause now we real independents
Who would have thought the cute little boy from down the street
Would fall in love with me
It's like a number one dream come true
To have somebody you love love you
And that's all that matters
That we grow together make sure we never shatter
You're the reason I live
Because I want you to get all that I got to give
Long as we're hand in hand
You my man I'm your girl
Ready to conquer the world
[Chorus]
Our love is mystical like galaxies you can't touch
Around the world and back again I love you that much
Our love is destiny like Bonnie and Clyde
We'll die of old age side by side
Throughout the days I remained truthful
I keep it tight for you sexy and youthful
I told my mom when our days are through
If you have to go first bury me next to you
What I feel is unexplainable
I love you this ain't enough to say to you
You've been there from the beginning to the end
My companion as well as my best friend
You got my heart now here's my life
Yes I'm ready to be your wife
From here on know that you're the one
Anything that you want it's done
[Chorus]
