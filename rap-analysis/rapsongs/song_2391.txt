[Verse 1 - Eminem] 
It's like a throne that he dont even own 
He wont sit down, given the crown he just throws it around 
It's like a joke he's like a king, but he dont rule a thing 
He dont want the diamonds, want the gold or want the jewelry 
He dont want the fame dont want the lute he's in it for a sport 
Runnin suckaz where theres competition round the court 
He appreciates your support but he aint beggin for it 
And you cant love it you can hate it but you cant ignore it 
You cant be that ignorant but you can try to sell him short 
But you cant fuck with his last joint or the one before it 
And he was gonna raise hell like them country boys 
And if I'm frontin then you better come confront me for it 
[Chorus - Nate Dogg] 
This Is The Story Of A Warrior I Kno U Kno It 
True Warriors Go Ahead N Make Some Noise 
It Ain't Healthy To Be Makin' Niggaz Paranoid 
Hit Ur Corner Wit More Weapon I Don't Need My Boyz 
Im Doin' 120 In The Fast Lane 
Kick Back Just Relax Let Me Do My Thang 
Dont Give a Fuck About You Suckas Gotta Maintain 
Money Power And Respect In This Rap Game
[Verse 2 - Lloyd Banks] 
He's straight outta the neighborhood but Niggaz hate 
They see you go and eat your dinner off a bigger plate 
Your stomachs ache while he's loungin at the big estate 
And he hops in a 100 thousand with a Nigga's gate 
House with just a bigger gate , houndin him was a big mistake 
He wont surrender he'll rather give up a rib to break 
'cause he remembers when they wouldnt lend a helpin hand 
So he was sittin on green like a Celtic fan 
Created a buzz so when you gotta mention his name 
When you discussin' the illest playa that's in the game 
And he's ridin with Em, 50 cent, Doc and them 
G Unit records aint no motherfuckin stoppin them 
[Chorus - Nate Dogg] 
This Is The Story Of A Warrior I Kno U Kno It

[Verse 3 - 50 Cent] 
He's no magician man the kid makes somethin' outta nuthin
So now niggaz from this hood act like we owe em somethin 
They talk crazy til we send niggas through there to buck em 
Ask 'em if theres a problem and they'll say naw its nothin 
He was gonna help em out, but since they fronted, fuck em 
He dont care how they feel, they can hate him or love him
He hold it down on his own the kid is really thuggin 
He's rich now, he aint change so Niggaz think he buggin 
He bullet proof everything in case niggaz try and buff him
Keep Two pistols on this hip I show you where he tuck em 
Niggaz say they gon' get at him but they cant touch him 
Try to catch em slippin, they creepin and he start bustin 
[Gun cock, Gun shot]
[Chorus - Nate Dogg]

I can give you niggaz' somethin' you can talk about 
I can turn your smile upside down 
You ain't no G-Unit fuckin' clown 
I can take your girl until I turn her out
Don't hold it in, let it all out
I can give you fuckers somethin' to be mad about
Invite her in send her back out
With my DNA all in her mouth.
