Yeah, yeah, [Incomprehensible], 'cause I got money
I got money you ***, that's right [Incomprehensible]
All I know is the sky is blue and the Coupe is new
And if ya money's right the *** is white
The birds fly south every year in the night
Gotta get it how you live *** them hataz
Get 'em, I'm get 'em off like hot potatoes
Good morning Vietnam yeah, we tryin' to earn stripes
Get jammed up of one can cost you ya whole life, damn
So say goodnight to the bad guy
Fresh pair of 87 jeans I'm so fly
My seats are suede my luggage is Louie
And every *** in the projects wanna do me
Snowman's the name, 100 grand on the chain
My seats are suede my luggage is Louie
And every *** in the projects wanna do me 'cause I got money
(You tellin' a joke, I got money, no, I'm serious)
Remember when I couldn't afford no cloths but now a days
A *** hit the baddest *** 'cause I got money
(Yeah, yeah, you know I'm serious man, I got money)
The Chevy's sittin' so high but the rims sit low, I got 'em from Baileys
CTE that's the label that pays me, I own that so I pay myself
Being brokes bad for my health, nyquill green 26 inches
Greenbriar mall pulled 26 ***, that's right
Make a quick stop serve 9 ***
These are my confessions, I'm a sucker for clothes
That paper stack up if you let it
But I keep *** up, I gotta shoe fetish
Bad habits I may walk just every week
Fifty pairs or new Nike's ain't cheap
You know I gotta get the cap to match, new era s*** I a town to that
Throw the bags in the trunk right back to the trap, wassup
My seats are suede my luggage is Louie
And every *** in the projects wanna do me 'cause I got money
(You tellin' a joke, I got money, no, I'm serious)
Remember when I couldn't afford no cloths but now a days
A *** hit the baddest *** 'cause I got money
(Yeah, yeah, you know I'm serious man, I got money)
See me in the drive off 30 down town evening Houston
It caught a flat tire had to leave it in Houston
And then ran out of gas in the blue GT
The minute we leave I cop the new GT
So now balla wouldn't call caught him livin' a lie
Hey, you can't help to spend it pimpin' if you gettin' it right
Listen if you be gettin' what I be gettin' tonight
You too would be high as a kite blowin' *** on a flight
Oh, I'm g 4'in at my 7 ay commercial ight
Just security being a *** can't get in with this
But everything 100 million again

My seats are suede my luggage is Louie
And every *** in the projects wanna do me 'cause I got money
(You tellin' a joke, I got money, no, I'm serious)
Remember when I couldn't afford no cloths but now a days
A *** hit the baddest *** 'cause I got money
(Yeah, yeah, you know I'm serious man, I got money)
