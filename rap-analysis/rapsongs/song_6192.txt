Yes sir! You're gonna do it like this
I am an animal defjammable titanical high flammable
Don't .. me I live ..
I'am eating ball
I didn't go to Hannibal
My anathema I prescribed it
Said you all in my hood like it
I advise them sterilize them
This ear wasn't clear to hear the album
Chorus
I know what you people gonna do without him
And these ladies gonna ... around and talk about him
So I keep in money and keep in rocking
Flammable titanical
Call me PIMP NUTS
On a chick but
She gotta a sister?
I got a mixer
My car inside is dark
The door is suicide Ã¢Â¦ cut
I am a wringer
You can see me
If I was Avatar in 3D
Hit the TOPCZ
You career like George Ã¢Â¦
You can hi hi
But I'm a ha ha
Next to Lady Gaga
In an I-pod
Near kept in a ..
I'm a fly guy? Well I'm not?
I'm like tata I rock music
I try to bisect for life like a Jewish kid
And me running in the block like a new kid
That's like HU! Not in a Ã¢Â¦ print
Chorus
I know what you people gonna do without him
And these ladies gonna ... around and talk about him
So I keep in money and keep in rocking
Flammable titanical
I was an asshole in the class role
Now I'm a sick nigger like a bad cold
Mister unforgettable Nat Cole
You can't witness none of it from the back role
Nigger move up and walk with my foot
And follow my ingredients like a cook book
Let me show you how to hustle ..
I even have something to oil you like a Ã¢Â¦ cook
Me short look? That is not me
I feel cookie like Rocky part three
When I speak white girls jack me
They know I rush limbo ..
Part me Ã¢Â¦ you'll find out
That I'm a lady's men
Rihanna felt
.. I'll blow your mind out
With dynamite Ã¢Â¦
Chorus
I know what you people gonna do without him
And these ladies gonna ... around and talk about him
So I keep in money and keep in rocking
Flammable titanical
