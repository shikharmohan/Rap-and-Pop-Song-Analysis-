Yo yo yo nigga
Swinging through the forests of the jungles
Yo c'mon, c'mon yo yo yo
Yo look around your seats
Do you see anybody weirder than me?
When you find him then I try him fry him like the gorilla
Billy Hanas to Hebrew, how to be an MC
Sheeyit take two tokes, I'm dope riding over notes
Overload your periscope, Doc da most
Lock and load with the rock 'n' roll star, dozed off
I had him bruised and closed off with one phone call
Chickens, mida mida the heater, believe-a I'm a dog
Straight labrador chedda retriever
Let the gorillas out, till the blood is spilling out
Put a slug up in his mouth, then the thug is chicken out
Darkrooms get ignited, bright lights on the mic
So when we battle they can via satellite it
P P P draft pick is massive, athlete Tenactin' flow
Doc captain up battin'! Brick City Mashin'!
Turn it up!
  (Come on)
Smoke that shit up!

Yo, yo-yo, I'm from Da Bricks where the weed go
For two for five dick, you try this
I promise I'll be at your video, smackin' the shit out of you
From crew to hairstylists
Guerrilla maneuver on an intruder
I pack like Sinbad pack the house in Aruba
Blow your brains yeah, leave the murder scene
Lookin' for me is like lookin' for Herb at Burger King
'I Get Around' like 2Pac and Shock G
Fuckin' hotties, block the block like Monopoly
I rock with an eighty-watt spitter, block lit up
Snatch profit up, get your Benz lock it up
So which nigga got a dope enough spot?
Call X to shut 'em down and I'll open up shop
P P P draft pick is massive, athlete Tenactin' flow
Doc captain up battin'! Brick City Mashin'!
Turn it up!
