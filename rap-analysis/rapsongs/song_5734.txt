Walkin' with my baby
She got great big feet
She's long, lean and like
Ain't had nothing to eat
But she's my baby
And I love her just the same
Crazy 'bout that woman
'Cause Caldonia is her name
Caldonia, Caldonia
What makes your big head so hard
I love you
Love you just the same
I'll always love you, baby
'Cause Caldonia is your name
You know my mama told me to leave Caldonia, love
That's what she told me, no kid
That's what she said, she says
"Son, keep away from that woman, she ain't no good
Don't bother her
But mama didn't know
What Caldonia was putting down
So I'm going down to Caldonia's house
And ask her just one more time
Caldonia, Caldonia
What makes your big head so hard
