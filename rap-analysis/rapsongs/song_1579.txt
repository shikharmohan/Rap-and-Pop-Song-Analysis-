What you know about the running, the stretching
The cars, the weapons, the path, the journey
The jewels, the learning, the fear, the focus
The aches, the pains
The contact sparrin', the breaks, the sprains
The trial and error, the ranks, and belts
The spiritual growth, the science of breath
The tests, the techniques, the forms, the stances
The flow, the rhythm, the internal answers
The herbs, the healing, the quiet meditation
The truths reveal through daily dedication
The love for the art, the sweat on your shirt
The mind, the body, and the spirit that work

Broken laws of nutrition, and pork and dishin'
The vitamins and supplements, salads and ointments

The crunches, the example you set for the youngsters
The will, the skills, the kill or the hill
The separation between what's fake and what's real
The laws of physics, the class "comradely"
The vows of humility, the bow, the courtesy
Self defense doesn't mean you run and attack someone
But you do have the right to defend yourself
By any means necessary
If you in that position to defend yourself, ha
