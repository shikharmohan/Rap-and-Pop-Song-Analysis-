Oh oh ohoo. 
damn, here we go again. 
Oh oh ohoo. 
Common passed on this beat, i made it to a jam, 
now everything im not, made me everything i am. 
damn, here we go again. 
people talkin shit, but when the shit hit the fan 
everything i'm not, made me everything i am. 
I never be picture-perfect-Beyonce 
Be light as Albi or black as Chauncey 
Remember him from Blackstreet 
He was as black as the street was 
I'll never be laid back as his beat was 
I never could see why people'll reach a 
Fake-ass facad they couldn't keep up 
Y'see how I creeped up? 
Y'see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah? 
I never rock a mink coat in the winter time like Killa Cam 
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like will.i.am 
Let me know if you feel it man 
Cause everything I'm not, made me everything I am 
Damn, here we go again. 
everybody sayin' what's not for him 
everything I'm not, made me everything I am 
damn, here we go again. 
people talk shit, but when shit hits the fan 
everything I'm not, made me everything I am 
and i'm back to tear it up 
haters, start your engines 
I hear 'em gearin' up 
people talk so much shit about me at barbershops 
they forget to get their haircut 
okay fair enough, the streets is flarin' up 
cause they want gun-talk, or I don't wear enough 
baggy clothes, Reebok's, or A-di-dos 
can I add that he do spaz out at his shows 
so say goodbye to the NAACP award 
goodbye to the In-di-a Arie award 
they'd rather give me the nigga-please award 
but I'll just take the I-got-alotta-cheese award 
damn, here we go again. 
everything I'm not, made me everything I am 
damn, here we go again. 
people talk shit, but when shit hits the fan 
everything I'm not, made me everything I am 
I know that people wouldn't usually rap this 
but I got the facts to back this 
just last year, Chicago had over 600 caskets 
man, killin's some wack shit 
oh, I forgot, 'cept for when nigga's is rappin' 
do you know what it feel like when people is passin'? 
he got changed over his chains, a block off Ashlamd 
I need to talk to somebody, pastor 
the church want time, so I can't afford to pay 
the slip on the door, cause I can't afford to stay 
my 15 seconds up, but I got more to say 
That's enough Mr. West, please no more today 
damn, here we go again. 
everybody sayin' what's not for him 
everything I'm not, made me everything I am 
damn, here we go again. 
people talk shit, but when shit hits the fan 
everything I'm not, made me everything I am
