I've seen a lot pain since I was a child so
(Pray for me)
I've done a few things that just ain't right so
(Pray for me)
What I've been through would make you cry so
(Pray for me, pray for me)
I'm trying to change my life so
(Pray for me)
Ain't no dope on the streets, mayne, I'm behind in my rent
I ain't got nothing to show for all the fedi that I done spent
I told my mom where the cash at, my live insurance policy is the money
She been planning on using to bury me
My ribs touching, my paper struggling, mayne
All my life I been hustling, running in place
But can't seem to finish the race
See dudes get whopped in the face
Get plucked like a bass, flew in the space for senselessness
That's why I stayed prayed up and say my grace
Even when I'm blended
Never know when your life is suspended
God can take his arms from around you and easily end it
At any time, any place, any where
I know my life has been spared on several occasions
Suckas hating, I'm still here
I can block for what's lost and never talk again to each other
Why does it take a funeral to bring a family together?
Bad weather always looks worse through a window
Stressing and rubbing my temples
I make it look easy but it's really not all that simple
I've seen a lot pain since I was a child so
(Pray for me)
I've done a few things that just ain't right so
(Pray for me)
What I've been through would make you cry so
(Pray for me, pray for me)
I'm trying to change my life so
(Pray for me)
Young dude full of soul food, mama cooking pork chops
Uncle slapping dominos, sister playing hop scotch
And this was before the block got hot and infected
And everybody knew my grand daddy well respected, check it
Time went on and the game began
I was losing comrades either death or the penn
I was losing comrades but I'm stacking them ends
We ever go to 600, we losing our friends
When grand mama passed that's when it all went bad
Aunties don't talk, my cousins fighting is bad
In the snow Thanksgiving is like the ones we had and it's sad
So I express through a pen and a pad
I'm on my third wind pimpin' and knowing Jesus is with me
Ain't no weapon form against me, back in common defeating
I've been posted in the cut when them angels come get me
Until that day, homie, just pray for me
I've seen a lot pain since I was a child so
(Pray for me)
I've done a few things that just ain't right so
(Pray for me)
What I've been through would make you cry so
(Pray for me, pray for me)
I'm trying to change my life so
(Pray for me)
My kinfolk, baby, momma on welfare, they house is bigger than ours
'Cause they got section 8 vouchers, W.I.C. and benefit cards
My home girl daughter diabetic, she like to eat a whole lot
She only 9 and a half and taking insulin shots
My dude got a heart condition, his ankle be swollen
'Cause he got high blood pressure and he refuse to quit smoking
But I'm no better than y'all, I like to drink alcohol
Break out the pen and start writing about the things that I saw
Like kilo grams of that [Incomprehensible] Peruvian flake
Wrapped in aluminum foil and duck tape
Bust open and throwed in the pot, foamy and mush
Melted and locked in a shape of a gigantic size white cookie
Put on the towel to dry and broken down into zips
Quarters and half of 16's and yola get flipped
I maintain my faith in G O D 'cause it's just a test
Repent, we confess, ask for gratefulness, yes, I'm blessed
I've seen a lot pain since I was a child so
(Pray for me)
I've done a few things that just ain't right so
(Pray for me)
What I've been through would make you cry so
(Pray for me, pray for me)
I'm trying to change my life so
(Pray for me)
I'm here right now
  (Pray for me)
I need y'all to take this, I need y'all to take this pain away
  (Pray for me)
I'm trying, feels like I'm dying
  (Pray for me)
I need y'all to pray for me, oh, Lord
  (Pray for me)
Every time I look around
  (Pray for me)
Somebody got something to say
(Pray for me)
(Pray for me)
I need y'all to pray for me
  (Pray for me)
I'm trying to do the right thing
  (Pray for me)
Pray for me
