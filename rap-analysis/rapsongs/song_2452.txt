[erick sermon]
Yo, whole thing man, got a lot of customers out there man, trying
To get paid off what we made.
[pmd]

Better get a grip on them lips, and get off the...

There was a hardy boy mystery you were trying to solve
Can't understand why you got involved
Here's a clue, try the ghetto master blaster
Now think who causes disaster
Clue number two, you give up? 
I figured, it was k la boss on the cut
He had help, sucker duck, now that's clue number three
You wrong, cause it was epmd

Mc's, get off the bandwagon
I'm not bragging, but tagging
And snagging the biter that tries to imitate
Time to go on strike and demonstrate
On the fo, that does not n-o
That if he pulls my card, I'm good to flow
Toe to toe, blow to blow, without h2o
Ayo, you want to battle? I'm good to g-o
Get off the bandwagon (repeat 2x)

This ain't a blast from the past, it's a boomer from the future
Feel free to scream "ho" or "yo" if it suits you
While the bass is booming and your face is glooming
Saying the e double e is def, you're not assuming
They're only one of many that think a jealous fellow
Say "yep" then step cause I'm cooler
[pmd]
Say "hmmm" now you're through, you're how not who
Before I'm gluing that butt like krazy glue
I roll into the party as if I was five-o
Book investigation biters like columbo
Pushing rap for some info in exchange for a jumbo
And when I find a sucker it's time to play rambo
Or play commando, you know? 
I knew it was the sucker with the new jack-ified afro
We rock rhymes then we we run em a while
Sucker mc's catch on, then they bite our style
They're confused, dazed, and amused
Sweating and thing because their rhymes are used
Seen us in the crowd then they own their cost
They run around like a chicken with their heads cut off
Get off the bandwagon (repeat 2x)
[erick sermon]
While my volume was swaying, you were saying
"who was that brother? " while the record was playing
I felt kinda happy like an ego trip
I had to laugh cause my energy's tip
My tradition is dissing in this position
And right about now I'm in perfect condition
And don't get mad, and don't stop hissing
Don't say nothing homeboy just listen
[pmd]
No talk or playing, sucker mc's I be slaying
Get off the bandwagon, you know what I'm saying? 
I devastate the hip-hop scene
Keep the feet moving like a dancing machine
E got my back (yeah) k la boss on the scratch
You wild on the groove with the beat on wax
I'm in my own world, no room for distraction
Controlling mc's while la boss keeps scratching
Get off the bandwagon (repeat 2x)
