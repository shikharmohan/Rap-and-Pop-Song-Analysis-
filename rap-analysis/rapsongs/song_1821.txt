Eve: Verse 1] 
Sick when she rock shit, stop when block shit 
Uh 
Stop, drop, shut 'em down open up shop shit 
Never try to run when she pull back the cock shit 
Got 'em goin' crazy, wonderin' when they could cop shit 
First lady, Ruff Ryder, honey got the hot shit 
Little kids be behind me screamin' out, "Can you stop miss?!!" 
Star-bound, money now, for jet-black drop shit 
Eve guarantee, betcha' niggaz wanna pop this 
I know they daddy's fiendin', daydreamin' bout me topless 
Try not to move ya head, come on now, stop it 
Real bitches listen while they ride around and knock my shit 
Hustle nigga betty take yours quicker than coke profit 
''cause I can double it, and put 
Bitch on bitch, brick on brick, stich on stich, who you fuckin wit? 
Not me, can't a nigga or bitch stop me 
You hatin' mothafuckas line up for your first copy 
[Nokio] 
[Chorus] 
Role it up and just lite some, UHH 
Y'all fuckin' with the right ones, UHH 
Where my niggaz with the big guns? 
And when you smoke that shit it's like, "WHOA!!WHOA!!" 
[Eve] 
Y'all fuckin' with the right ones, UHH 
Where my niggaz that take ones? 
Role it up and just lite some, UHH 
''cause when we smoke that shit it's like "WHOA!!WHOA!!" 
[Verse 2: Eve] 
Uh, yo 
Start the beef, hold up, ran when we roled up 
Tough guy, wanna try ya luck? Betcha' fold up 
Ask around partner, got this whole shit sewed up 
Gotcha' cryin' like, "Man I wanna blow up!!" 
Cowards make me sick, swere to god I wanna throw-up 
Answer in a session with me? You better flow tough 
Offended? Don't agree with what i'm sayin' nigga? So what? 
Question, 'Can she really hold it down?' (sure enough) 
Now I gotta teach you respect, you better slow up 
You know what? Quick to take the next man shyne 
Philly's where she from, but when she smoke, she like to go Dutch 
Quick to make him start bitchin' make the next man whine 
Fuckin babies!! Go ahead and lay down, it's nap-time 
Same shit you spittin', heard it in your last rhyme 
Ain't to much thatchu' could do, so that'chure skills could pass mine 
Car eer fineto, here's some dough, go watch a peep show 
[Chorus] 
[Nokio] 
Role it up and just lite some, UHH 
Y'all fuckin' with the right ones, UHH 
Where my niggaz with the big guns? 
And when you smoke that shit it's like, "WHOA!!WHOA!!" 
[Eve] 
Y'all fuckin' with the right ones, UHH 
Where my niggaz that take ones? 
Role it up and just lite some, UHH 
''cause when we smoke that shit it's like "WHOA!!WHOA!!" 
[Verse 3: Eve] 
What me to talk crazy, shit, my moms made me 
And all ya'll niggas can do is *???spend a paybie???* 
Call my celly to come get you while I pass you in your Range 
Ain't gonna never change, do anything for bricks 
Nigga ride ya shotgun in the car wit' your friends 
And what the fuck you wanna do? But wanna blow out your brains? 
Clown, I spot 'em from the time you buy me a drink 
Instantly I get a vision of diamond studded links, and full ink minks 
And little doggies dyed pink 
''cause I know ya wanna spend your last, before you even think 
If you know somethin', speak the shit, I can keep a secret 
To me, the niggas with the most money, is the cheapest 
Wanna give me money off the book? Daddy you can keep it 
That's why they got the most sites, and in the most fights 
And walk with big brolic niggas thats protectin' they life 
If you know you pussy nigga, take off the ice 
[Nokio] 
[Chorus] 
Y'all fuckin' with the right ones, UHH 
Role it up and just lite some, UHH 
Where my niggaz with the big guns? 
And when you smoke that shit it's like, "WHOA!!WHOA!!" 
[Eve] 
Y'all fuckin' with the right ones, UHH 
Role it up and just lite some, UHH 
Where my niggaz that take ones? 
''cause when we smoke that shit it's like "WHOA!!WHOA
