Hello, hello, yo, yo, hello, hello, yo, yo
Hello, hello, yo, yo, hello, hello, yo, yo
Hello, hello, yo, yo, hello, hello, yo, yo
Call me on the telephone
Whether, 2-1-2, or 7-1-8
Or 9-1-4, I love it hardcore
When it's over the phone, it's safe to do it raw
Imaginary worlds we could both explore
Hello, baby what you wearin' right now?
Hot pants, my girl ain't around, let's get down
And I hope the phone's tapped, let's pretend you on my lap
I'm bouncin' up and down with my shoulders back
Nigga you like that?
You see I'm runnin' up my bill
Momma might hear me, but you just too ill
I got your flicks lined up, stereo low
Cherry flavored grease beneath my elbow
If I was there what would you do? I'd lay you on your back
Ride or die daddy and I love it like that
Hello, hello, yo, yo, hello, hello, yo, yo
Hello, hello, yo, yo, hello, hello, yo, yo
Hello, hello, yo, yo, hello, hello, yo, yo
Call me on the telephone
You the freak of my dreams, the reason that I keep on baggy jeans
Oooh, I love me a nigga from killer Queens
I'ma rub up on your muscles, ride 'til I'm sweatin' it
I bet you I can make you cum first, throw the bets in
I'm a nasty nigga, made to order
Kiss below the border with a warm glass of water
Is you wit me? Yeah, tell me how it taste
I promise I'll keep the telephone right in my face
How it feel? Feels good, where you at? in the hood
Talkin' on the phone like a good girl should
To my nig', baby I'ma reach my peak
Strawberry shortcake, good enough to eat
And I taste mad sweet, we big freaks
Blastin' off on the phone seven days a week
Hello, hello, yo, yo, hello, hello, yo, yo
Hello, hello, yo, yo, hello, hello, yo, yo
Hello, hello, yo, yo, hello, hello, yo, yo
Call me on the telephone
I throw sugar in the water so the ice tastes sweet
To make sure your ex-man can't compete
Shower curtain on the bed, warm baby oil
G-string sittin' like a snake in a coil
Hold on, I think somebody on the other line
Interrupt this nut I'ma bust, you out your mind
Lay back, imagine us chest to chest
Tongue-kissin' deep while we spark a sess
Everything is crazy, L do it the best
Ridin' rough baby, put my pipe to the test
On the telephone? Yeah, this is the ill zone
I wanna make you moan until it's a dial tone
However you want it baby, I'm raw to the bone
Three, three, two, two, one ,one, telephone
Hello, hello, yo, yo, hello, hello, yo, yo
Hello, hello, yo, yo, hello, hello, yo, yo
Hello, hello, yo, yo, hello, hello, yo, yo
Call me on the telephone
Yeah, yeah, knamsayin'? Word up
That's what I'm talkin' about
All you gotta do is hit me
