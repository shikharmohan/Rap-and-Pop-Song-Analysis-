We thuggish ruggish niggas always, always
And ready to bring the war up your way, if you hate
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
Would you look into my eyes?
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
Could you tell me what you see?
Coming through the door with my militia
Why do they bring big niggas?
Fuck y'all with a gang of bodyguards
My niggas is stone cold killas, peelas
Stepping out the Limos, the bitch soldiers maintain
Giving my babies all of my money
But my diamonds steady be shining
My gang, you know me, homies got mo' love
And I'm blessed, when I'm outta my sentence
Pump my fist to 'Mo Thug'
Gotta keep the Lord up over my shoulders
Jesus sent me His roll or loco
Sober, load a revolver, hold up
Now, buck 'em all to Hell 'cause I'm showin' 'em
And I seen that the bullet holes was too much, no luck
Ya get blowed up, all of you niggas goes out
The surgeons say that your body can not be sewed up
Hold up, and wait a minute
It's time for Bone Thugs
'Cause y'all think that you can really hate, nigga
We thuggish ruggish niggas always, always
And ready to bring the war up your way, if you hate
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
Would you look into my eyes?
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
Could you tell me what you see?
What makes a nigga think he can bite my shit
And call his shit original?
What's worse, telling people you made the style
We put down three fucking years ago
And that's just like a nigga, wanna take all the credit
I bet it didn't even occur
That we would eventually meet with ya, kid
Don't crash, collide, lock up with the enemy
And I don't wanna say a nigga's name and all that
But a y'all fin to get stomped, let 'em loose
And they heard the news, ya run up, ya could get dead, oh
Uh, huh, hey, we murder muthafuckas in a deadly way
Fully automatic when we let 'em lay
"Aw shit, get down, Leatherface"
Fuck 'em all, if I can't get my respect
Come on, now, put them to rest
What a bloody, bloody mess but nevertheless, we won't stress
I figured this platinum got you acting
Like you got to be me
It's all in your mind but in time
You'll find we as real as we speak
We thuggish ruggish niggas always, always
And ready to bring the war up your way, if you hate
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
Would you look into my eyes?
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
Could you tell me what you see?
All I see is this soldier, pistol in holster
Giving you the most, I toast to them thugs
Nigga, nothing but the love of bud
That we brought to the table
And a nigga wanna test, catch slugs, put 'em in the mud
Harmony smooth with the thug shit
Mo' murda to the fools that clone
Five niggas loc'd out with the roughness, nigga
And it's war when you craft these Bones, we can get it on
And I'm referring to all of y'all bitches
Y'all know who y'all are when y'all tried that
Rollin' with the E since '93, shutting
Shit down in the industry, nigga, can you bite that?
I know y'all niggas wanna roll with pros
And make friend of foes
But we chosen, God done blessed us with His potion
Pure devotion, freely spoken, baby
Niggas can't see us never, stay together
My click too clever
Riding through the days of the stormy weather
Remember, 'Eternal', it means for everlasting
Number 1 assassin blasting
Bashing on all you niggas's what I'm doing
All of the Heavens gonna be ruling trues, when He come
We won't be losing, provin' 'em wrong
We thuggish ruggish niggas always, always
And ready to bring the war up your way, if you hate
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
Would you look into my eyes?
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
Could you tell me what you see?
I see five killa realer niggas ready to roll wherever I go
True to pull the trigger, smother a nigga
Put 'em in a river, we the killas, and that's for sure
Niggas out there clowning mine, you can't rhyme
The style you got is all mine
And when I see you, bitch, I'm going in your pockets double time
And it's like that, you don't want that
Come and get some pap, pap, wanna sound like?
Wanna be like? Nigga, we can't have that
Why a nigga wanna bite the Bone shit? Platinum raps
Nigga bet that biting shit ain't doing nothing
Trying to make something outta nothing
Fuck it, let's peel caps, buck 'em all down
Put 'em in check, fuck 'em up with the 44 Mag, I'm glad
'Cause when you're fucking with Bone
We sending 'em home in a body bag
Now, look into my eyes, bet you see a realer killa thug
Putting it down with Harmony, Harmony
We thuggish ruggish niggas always, always
And ready to bring the war up your way, if you hate
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
Would you look into my eyes?
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
Could you tell me what you see?
