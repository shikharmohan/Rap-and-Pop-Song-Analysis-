Here we go!
Surprise nigga
It was bound to happen sooner or later
They ain't ready for this)
History has been made
ATL, yeah

All these hataz wanna grill me
But fuck that I'm bout my money if it kills me
(Yeah baby)

This tha A-town, come into my hood
Ay, I wish a mothafucka would
Houston, Dallas come into they hood
Ay, I wish a mothafucka would
I keep a fresh pair of one's on my feet
And double deuces on da Chevy
3's company the double 4's on my belly
5 hot amps speakers shake like jelly
So many wires in my trunk look like a bowl of spaghetti
Assault and batteries, but my trunk stay ever ready
Assault and battery if you scared you never ready
And yeah I went green, 26s on the hybrid
Smoked so much green that I can't open up my eyelids
Wake up in London, go to sleep on Atlanta time
Still my paint got more candy then your Valentine
For 5 mill I bought a lake front crib
Bentley car cover lookin' like a laced frontwig
Of course they hatin' cause they still ridin' tha marta train
Rename the yacht put the plane in my daughter's name
Now that's karma so call me Daddy Warbucks
If you got money, I got mo' bucks

Luda!
I'm freak like a Scorpio
Custom hood scoops make the coupe look like Pinocchio
I'm rich bitch, I should drop cash
The inside of the 'lac look like a wood shop class
And these women gimme love like it's tennis time
So many shoes that my closet look like Finish Line
So many acres that my crib look like Bermuda
So many diamonds the safe look like Kay jewelers
That spot about to drop my team said Luda get it
Now 50 thou says that I'm the first nigga with it
First round draft pick, later for you imbeciles
The car is all black like it got traded to the Timberwolves
And I keep a little bit of that green up in the lining
But as the weather change my weed adjust to different climates
Green in the summer time, orange in the spring
Now it's black with that purp, I call my whip the Sac King
Cuz' I got it
All these hataz wanna grill me,
But fuck that I'm bout my money if it kills me
(Yeah baby)
And I'm up to no good
Ay, I wish a mothafucka would
Chi-town and Detroit, come into they hood
Ay, I wish a mothafucka would
D.C. and B-Boy, come into they hood
Ay, I wish a mothafucka would
I'm fly enough to fly away, trouble I don't shy away
From it I annihilate suckers in they driveway
In church on Sunday morning praying about what happened Friday
But then the consequences for comin' to pimpin' sideways
Nowadays guess it pays to change
In cahoots with corporations making major change
With magnificent watches and amazing chains
Plush pad in Atlanta and L.A.'s the same
I ball til I'm bored with selections and assortments
Of automotives worth a small fortune of course
There's the 7-2 Chevel hardtop, 69 drop, 60 Campese
You can barely pay your lease
P dude wanna talk new school, tell em go ahead
Drop head double R, Maybachs and [incomprehensible]
Swag got the ass, stack cash to the hair line
Fuck another car, it's time to try an buy an airline
Cuz I got it
All these hataz wanna grill me
But fuck that I'm 'bout my money if it kills me
(Yeah baby)
And I'm up to no good
Ay, I wish a mothafucka would

Ay, I wish a mothafucka would
