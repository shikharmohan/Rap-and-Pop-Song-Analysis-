Close your mind, close your eyes, see with your heart
How do you forgive the murderer of your father?
The ink of a scholar is worth a thousand times more
Than the blood of a martyr
We came through the storm
Nooses on our necks and a smallpox blanket to keep us warm
On a 747, on the Pentagon lawn
Wake up, the alarm clock is connected to a bomb
Anthrax lab on a West Virginia farm
Shorty ain't learned to walk, already heavily armed
Civilians and little children is especially harmed
Camouflaged Torahs, Bibles and glorious Korans
The books that take you to Heaven
And let you meet the Lord there
Have become misinterpreted, reasons for warfare
We read 'em with blind eyes
I guarantee you there's more there
Rich must be blind because they didn't see the poor there
Yeah, need to open up a park
Just closed 10 schools, we don't need 'em
Can you please call the Fire Department?
They're down here marching for freedom
Burn down ATV's, turn their TV's on to teach 'em and move
The more money that they make
The more money that they make
The better and better they live
Whatever they wanna take
Whatever they wanna take
Whatever whatever it is
The more that you wanna learn
The more that you try to learn
The better and better it gets
American terrorist
Now the poor Klu Klux, man, see that we're all brothers
Not 'cause things are the same
Because we lack the same color
And that's green, now that's mean
Can't burn his cross 'cause he can't afford the gasoline
Now if a Muslim woman strapped with a bomb on a bus
With the seconds running give you the jitters
Just imagine a American-based Christian organization
Planning to poison water supplies
To bring the Second Coming quicker
Nigga, they ain't living properly
Break 'em off a little democracy
Turn their whole culture to a mockery
Give 'em Coca-Cola for their property
Give 'em gum, give 'em guns, get 'em young, give 'em fun
If they ain't giving it up, then they ain't getting none
And don't give 'em all, naw ,man, just give 'em some
It's the paper, some of these cops must be Al-Qaeda, nigga
The more money that they make
The more money that they make
The better and better they live
Whatever they wanna take
Whatever they wanna take
Whatever whatever it is
The more that you wanna learn
The more that you try to learn
The better and better it gets
American terrorist
More money that they make
The more money that they make
The better and better they live
Whatever they wanna take
Whatever they wanna take
Whatever whatever it is
The more that you wanna learn
The more that you try to learn
The better and better it gets
