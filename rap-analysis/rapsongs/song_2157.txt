Tell me when to go, tell me when to go
Tell me when to go, tell me when to go
Go, dumb, go, dumb, go, dumb, go, dumb
Go, dumb, go, dumb, go, dumb, go, dumb
Tell me when to go, tell me when to go
Tell me when to go, tell me when to go
Go, dumb, go, dumb, go, dumb, go, dumb
Go, dumb, go, dumb, go, dumb, go, dumb
Ooh Jesus Christ had dreads, so shake 'em
I ain't got none, but I'm planning on growing some
Imagine all the Hebrews going dumb
Dancing on top of chariots and turning tight ones
Ooh, tell me when to go
(Dumb)
Talking on my ghettro on my way to the store
My 2nd or 3rd trip
Some Henne, some Swishers and some Listerine Strips
Dr. Greenthumb lift just to ease my thoughts
Not just the cops, but the homies you gotta watch
The moon is full, look at the dark clouds
Sitting in my scraper, watching Oakland goin' wild, tadow
I don't bump mainstream, I knock underground
All that other sh**, sugar-coated and watered down
I'm from the Bay where we hyphy and go dumb
From the soil where them rappers be getting they lingo from
Tell me when to go, tell me when to go
Tell me when to go, tell me when to go
Go, dumb, go, dumb, go, dumb, go, dumb
Go, dumb, go, dumb, go, dumb, go, dumb
Tell me when to go, tell me when to go
Tell me when to go, tell me when to go
Go, dumb, go, dumb, go, dumb, go, dumb
Go, dumb, go, dumb, go, dumb, go, dumb
I'm off that 18 purple juice
***** like a mayne, labeled the Black Zeus
King of the super dooper hyphy hyphy hyphy
Hyphy and you wifey, you don't like me, like me, like me
From the Bay to the A
Put me in the back wood, swisher sweet bud
It's dope, it's just some sh** I wrote
I said you couldn't be saved by John the Pope
I slid past on the gas, ******** looking at me
It's good, it's good like the granddaddy
Cross game, you get flipped like a burger patty
Or zig-zagged, pass me the big old fatty
I drink white with a snow bunny
Talkin' big sh** in a scraper going hella dumb
1800 Jose Cuervo
[Incomprehensible] y'all kna' I'm saying though?
Tell me when to go, tell me when to go
Tell me when to go, tell me when to go
Go, dumb, go, dumb, go, dumb, go, dumb
Go, dumb, go, dumb, go, dumb, go, dumb
Tell me when to go, tell me when to go
Tell me when to go, tell me when to go
Go, dumb, go, dumb, go, dumb, go, dumb
Go, dumb, go, dumb, go, dumb, go, dumb
Ooh, now let me direct traffic for a minute
(Talk to 'em)
Let me tell y'all about this hyphy movement we got going in the Bay
When I say somethin' you say it right back at me
You smell me? We gon' do it like this here
Ooh
Ghost-ride the whip, ghost-ride the whip
Ghost-ride the whip, ghost-ride the whip
Now scrape, scrape
Scrape, scrape
Scrape, scrape
Scrape, scrape
Put your stunna shades on, put your stunna shades on
Put your stunna shades on, put your stunna shades on
Now gas, brake, dip, dip
Gas, brake, dip, dip
Shake them dreads, shake them dreads
Shake them dreads, shake them dreads
Let me see you show your grills, let me see you show your grills
Let me see you show your grills, let me see you show your grills
Now thizz-face, thizz-face
Thizz-face, thizz-face
Doors open, mayn, doors open, mayn
Doors open, mayn, doors open, mayn
Now watch 'em swang, watch 'em swang
Now watch 'em swang, watch 'em swang
Go stupid
(Go, dumb, go, dumb)
Go stupid
(Go, dumb, go, dumb)
Tell me when to go, tell me when to go
Tell me when to go, tell me when to go
Go, dumb, go, dumb, go, dumb, go, dumb
Go, dumb, go, dumb, go, dumb, go, dumb
Ooh
Tell me when to go, tell me when to go
Tell me when to go, tell me when to go
Go, dumb, go, dumb, go, dumb, go, dumb
Go, dumb, go, dumb, go, dumb, go, dumb
Ooh
Go, dumb, go, dumb, go, dumb, go, dumb
Go, dumb, go, dumb, go, dumb, go, dumb, go
