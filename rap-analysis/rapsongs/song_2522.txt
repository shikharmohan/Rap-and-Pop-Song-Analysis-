Hah, let me introduce my dj, scratch the black balboa
I'm erick sermon, the dope rhyme blower
My dj scratchatori, interesting like, war stories
With epmd, the fame and the glory
The boy wonder, the second nature, the arnold schwarzeneggar
_the eraser_, upon the crossfader
From brook-lyn, albany projects
Been around the world with the dj sets, catchin wreck
[parrish smith]
Yo the track drives me to excel
Scratch is dangerous like a third rail
Got the feel like braille, stayed charged like a duracell
The show-stopper, knockin cats out like rock'em'sock'em
Can't stop him, so playa hatin is your only option
Hands quicker than roy jones with no headphones
Bk albany pj's where my man zone
Epmd and scratch, the quarterback
Meltin wax, flippin more tracks than amtrak

* the lady of rage sample *
"cause i'ma break it down to the nitty gritty one time
When it comes to the" [scratch] "i gets busy with mine"

It's on now baby..
