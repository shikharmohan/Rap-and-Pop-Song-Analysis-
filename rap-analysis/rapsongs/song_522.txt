Dear Lord, cannot stand

No look what we've done, what have we done?
Amongst our sin, why here, we follow people for starez
Don't stare
No mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy
Evil is lurkin', lurkin', lurkin'
We can run but can't escape tha beast, no
Tickin' by that snake in tha grass
That snake in tha grass
By that snake in tha grass
Better sticked and missed his ass
Fast blast, I leave my cash
'Cause my dayz of livin' broke is all in tha past
So I gotta keep my mind up on my money
It's survival of tha fittest
Could I one of tha realest are ya dayz of drug dealin'?
Like in '89, now it's almost 1999, new millennium
Fuck the luck, 'cause they be gettin' 'em
Sendin' demonz str8 to hell, let them burn in hades
Worried enough, we called in jail
Lord bless our babies
Lord pleaze bless our babies
Who it be, givin' you that new shit ya love?
Who it be, givin' you that new shit ya never heard of
Clap yo' handz foe Bone everybody

Or get road over, road over
