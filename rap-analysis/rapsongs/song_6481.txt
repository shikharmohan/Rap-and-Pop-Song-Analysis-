Alone in my four cornered room
Starin' at candles
Are we on the radio Dukes?
Yeah, give it to me
Yeah, at night I can't sleep I'm tossin' and turnin'
I still got the candlesticks burnin'
It ain't changed but it's a different time
And I'm still playin' tricks with my mind
My mothers always stressin' that I'm livin' wrong
But I got my Smith and Wesson 'cause I'm gettin' grown
And they're lookin' at your little boys success
And I been thinkin', I'm dealin' with too much stress
So I stay up on my P's and Q's
And watch out for the G's and fools
'Cause the homies that I thought I had
See me stackin' up a grip and they just started talkin' bad
So I stay away from outsiders and when I roll through
It makes 'em open they mouth wider
I used to think that you my one and only homie
My mind was playin' tricks on me
My mind was playin' tricks on me
Yeah, get up
Dear diary I'm havin' a little problem with my mind state
How many bullets would it take to change my mind?
Wait, sometimes I want to end it but I don't though
They tell me see my pastor but I don't go
'Cause they all be on this one street
So I take it on myself to thank him one deep
And give my money to the most needy
And never put it in the hands of the most greedy
'Cause they're puttin' a price tag on a man's word
And it's a fashion show, so the men flirt
The world is endin' so they try to make us switch fast
And they openin' up these churches for some quick cash
And usin' the money fo' they new cribs
While brother Johnson just got kicked out where he lived
I follow no man, 'cause man be phoney
My mind was playin' tricks on me
My mind was playin' tricks on me
Yeah, day by day it's more impossible to cope
I feel like I'm the one that's doin' dope
Can't seem to keep my mind on a steady track
I'm all about gettin' mine so I study that
But it seems they want to get me
So I try to keep my nine millimeter wit me
Just in case they want to see a homies head blown
But I got to stay around to see my kids grown
I finally found a woman who could deal wit me
Back then I had a girl who wouldn't real wit me
And now she's back with her old lady
And now I got it goin' on and they sure hate me
Now I'm a gone and she's alone, yeah
Her mind was playin' tricks on her
One time for your motherfuckin' mind
Bringin' it back like this here
1 9 9 1 all the way to the 1 9 9 4
And they call me Face, yeah
My mind was playin' tricks on me
