Here comes the conquering brother
That fathoms and never ceases
Violators pick up the pieces
(Uh)
That are left behind as you're left to find
The fury of the five fingers of death are mine
Rippin' on the microphone, receitin' poem
Givin' competition a Big Daddy syndrome
Some step up, none kept up
(Mmm)
(Mmm)
They rap a brief moment and then shut up
Lips are sealed because all of this is real
I'm not about frontin', I tell the real deal of society
(What?)
So how we livin' like a turkey on Thanksgiving
Or like Robin Gibbons? Not to offend
I just want you to comprehend every message I send
(Tell 'em)
'Cause I don't understand, I have to wonder, damn
How could this lifestyle be fun to man
To see a brother gettin' paid undercover
Sellin' drugs to one another
'Cause all the glamor you get is miscellaneous
And all the product you sell is real dangerous
Like um, um, let's say, un, poison
Destruction to all your own boys and girls
Who like to buy and give it a try
Admire and can't deny the high
That's why they soon die
These are the games that a fool would play today
For our own kind to decay, no sign of brotherly love
Just scavengers in search of
Another victory
When I'm ridin' in my Volvo, cops harass me
They never ride past me, they hound me like Lassie
Wantin' to give me a summons or a ticket
Huh, I got a place for them to stick it
(Kick it)
They can't understand to see a black man
Drivin' a car that costs 25 grand
The first thing they say is, "Where'd you steal her?"
And then they assume that I'm a drug dealer
Huh, that just makes me wanna laugh
'Cause now I'm a star and your son got my autograph
So all the cops on the highway gettin' me
My name ain't Kieth, so could you please stop sweatin' me
So I can flow and go on, so on and so on
To all the jams Cee throw on
Reachin' a summit as you learn from it
A lesson taught from yours truly, so here cometh
The royal majesty, others have to be
Fully prepared, though they still won't last with me
So when you hope to hang or even handle
I'll show the meaning of power and just cancel
(Period)
Out of order, conquer and slaughter
You're comin' up shorter, boy, you'll need more to
Compete 'cause the heat is deep in concrete
Defeat, bring up the fleet, flee 'fore we meet
Or stay away, puttin' new rhymes on layaway
Then come get this when you're ready for business
'Cause aaaaah yeah, I'm with this
(I'm ready)
Yo, Mister Cee, what is this?
Another victory
MC's and enemies I freeze at 32 degrees
Because they can't drop rhymes like these
Competition never saw none done
So pay attention as I mention the 411
Just the other day, I heard a brother say
"Taxi cabs don't even come my way
They all be afraid they won't get paid
So they zoom right past and pick up a lighter shade"
"And if they stop, the first thing they want
No more than two people and the money up-front
Treatin' me like I'm some type of thug
It might sound bugged but they don't wanna get mugged"
Who's in the right or wrong? It's time to unite along
The righteous with a walk in success and be strong
Instead of lookin' for someone to beef with
A brother like the Big Daddy Kane is peace with
Rappers of today like
(Kid 'N' Play)
Hey, even my man L.L.Cool J
(Stetsasonic) and EPMD
Public Enemy and
(BDP)
Salt 'N' Pepa 'cause we can't sever never
Wheihter, whatever, we better stand together
That means unite, not fightin' or fussin' or cussin'
Save all the base for the pipe and start lovin'
One another 'cause separation is a flaw
So endure for more and stop lookin' for
Another victory
Another victory
Another victory
