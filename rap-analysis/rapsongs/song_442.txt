Indeed if I fall, every time I'm fallin', fallin'
There's no doubt, God helps me rise
That He do, that He do
I said, indeed if I fall, every time I'm fallin', fallin'
There's no doubt, God helps me rise
That He do, that He do
With the everyday bullshit I be goin' thru
I be hopin' just to make it thru another day
Lookin' for another way
To live my life in peace, get away
I stay high with my gun, paranoid so if they come
Then I dump, dump, dump
That's really all that I got for ya
This life is crazy, I might go crazy, if I'm down
Don't let 'em break me, so I stop and I pray to God
Oh Lord, forgive me for my worldly lies
And help me thru this pain of mine
Pray and I pray, I pray
That I can just see the light
And fly away, away, away, away
But I know, I can call on You when I'm all alone
Whenever I fall, I fall, I fall
Indeed if I fall, every time I'm fallin', fallin'
There's no doubt, God helps me rise
That He do, that He do
I said, indeed if I fall, every time I'm fallin', fallin'
There's no doubt, God helps me rise
That He do, that He do
Situations got me thinkin' was it worth this
And then I got to thinkin' 'cause I love this
Stay down, it'll work itself in time
Don't be misled by these troubles in life
Everybody wants that miracle
Just so far from where will it go
If it's meant to be then it'll come for sure, for sure
And I know, I know, it gets hard sometimes
But don't you give up, it's gonna be better times
If you believe, just believe
It's no tellin' what you'll receive
Livin' proof, look at me, look at me, look at me
And ya gotta love this gift that we been blessed with, I do
Number one and can't nobody touch this, ya know
Gotta hit my knees and let Him know
I thank You, without You, where would I be, where would I go
Indeed if I fall, every time I'm fallin', fallin'
There's no doubt, God helps me rise
That He do, that He do
I said, indeed if I fall, every time I'm fallin', fallin'
There's no doubt, God helps me rise
That He do, that He do
Ain't no tellin' what this life bound to bring
One day ya here, the next day ya gone
That's why I try to live right
Don't wanna live wrong
Ain't no guarantee if ya gone make it home
What go around come around
Everybody know that it's real when you speakin' the kharma
So do unto others like you wanna be done
Like Mary J, no more drama
I'm a paper chaser, believe that
On the ground where I plant my feet at
If it's not about money I don't need that
You can keep that gossip, can't you see that
Stay locked on my mission
'Cause most of these niggaz in the world
Ain't thinkin' 'bout the future, young black entrepreneur
And I'm out to get more, so baby open the door
They gotta let me in, 'cause again and again
I done said that I was gone get dollars
If it's not about cheese, I'll holla
Fuckin' with a nigga that'a way too polished
If the road get rough, I'ma stand my ground
Keep my faith and call on the Lord
And I don't have to worry no more
Even if I fall
Indeed if I fall, every time I'm fallin', fallin'
There's no doubt, God helps me rise
That He do, that He do
I said, indeed if I fall, every time I'm fallin', fallin'
There's no doubt, God helps me rise
That He do, that He do
I'ma be a soldier, ready for gunshots
For the day I see Jehovah
You think you know us
Nigga though you don't so
Don't think that I made it just 'cause crossroads
Little measly Grammy ain't did nothin' for my family
No artist is that fast and scared to tell the truth
And the hardest niggas I see is raisin' they youth
Little food for thought since all of y'all bullshittin', admit it
You say anything uplifting, it'll be distance
To the kids that used to listen to ya
[Incomprehensible]
Anglo-saxon essence of abuse you're better alive
County or prison met solid kitchen
Better survive in your own trinity, prison
Infinity's waitin' on ya, baby
Swallow your pride and maybe you'll ride
Indeed if I fall, every time I'm fallin', fallin'
There's no doubt, God helps me rise
That He do, that He do
I said, indeed if I fall, every time I'm fallin', fallin'
There's no doubt, God helps me rise
That He do, that He do
