It goes one, two, three
That's the count of the immaster mount that's got scrilla
We got the killa Taj
And willa young lady looking sensuous to socialize
I sense she is down so she lie
Back with me
'Cuz it's a natural thing, so act quickly
'Cuz it's like that we gunna be
Out the dope stack and my pockets relax
Calm, collecting my scratch
And the girlies attracted
I snatched
Women, make them collapse on their back side, that's right
When I'm finished, vanish into the night
Like the caped crusader don't say, "Hi", to the trick
Can't appreciate them 'cuz they just be riding the dick
See, we too fly to be weak, telling hoes to step aside
Be like, "I ain't the one"
But get them sprung when I'm erectified
I betcha tried to get my dope but nope
Always cautious with my cash 'cuz my dad told me so
My rhyme will blow your foe away
I know the way to freak it
So hoes know the 'A'
Today's just another day for me to get paid
Invade the stage and retreat for the shade
Find me a top bread freak to get laid
Back when I'm masquerade
I get basquerade [unverified]
Direct from my spectrum
To select from, sex them, neglect them
Then I'm on the the next one.
Yeah, grab the money and run
You gotta, get the girl, grab the money and run
You gotta, get the girl, grab the money and run
You gotta, get the girl, grab the money
We dissin' rappers 'cuz I think I need to
We chillin' drinkin' 80 proof
