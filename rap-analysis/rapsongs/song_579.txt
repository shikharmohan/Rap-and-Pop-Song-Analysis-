Raising hustlas, thieves and prostitutes
Young homie think before you shoot
Murderah where will our children go
When there's no place safe where they can go?
And trouble may come and some time
You'll get pulled over by one time
And when in 1999 rewinds did'n even make any strides
Murder all around the whole world is nausiating
Everybody hating everybody over rated
Why everybody actin' agitated?
I thought we graduated back in the saddle
Waitin'
(Board)
Aboard the battle station
Hation is a birth defect and you know ain't nobody perfect
And when the curtains close, open up the door, no more, no more
See were losing this world we love
And it looks like the sinnin' won't end
So I'm reachin' high up above
Lord let your blessings begin
And let's change the world
And let's change the world
(World)
Let's change the world
(World)
Let's change the world
Let's change the world
Let's change the world
(World)
Let's change the world, let's change the world

Flesh it got me ready to set off the riot
Ridin' with my trues
Humbly united gathering souls
Here we go, roll up some more phillies
My nigga let me hit it
Niggas we thuggin' immortalized
Let's get high it's them niggas you most desire
I could remember from way back in the day
Coming up out of the ghetto was a hell of a struggle
For selling the fiends llello
But it was my dream to kick flows to put my people on another level
Like it'll be for the lust
(Lust)
Or could it be for the rush
(Rush)
My niggas love when they bust
(Bust)
They steady buck and you duck
(Duck)
They'll put you deep in the dust
(Dust)
My niggas creepin' on ah, come up
(Come up)
Black nigga killa
(Killa)
Thuggish ruggish nigga
Nigga pin it nigga finna desend into a dawn of a new millennium
Anticipatin' life without satan
Hatin' and our enemies to hell, I'm sendin' 'em
And let's change the world
And let's change the world
(World)
Let's change the world
(World)
Let's change the world
Let's change the world
Let's change the world
(World)
Let's change the world, let's change the world

Everyday the devil at me and I wish the Lord threw a hummer at me
I ain't happy me and Eazy-E in a B E N Z
With my niggas right next to me
It's my legacy we can't let it stop us
Unh, unh, not now
The whole world endin' up the buck buck, pow
Corruption, destruction, disaster
Everybody tryin' to rap faster than the master
Oh Lord, could you save my soul?
Nigga tryin' to go platinum around 40 years old
The Lord knows we can do this shit
It ain't no stoppin' us now 'cause we can prove this shit
Nigga me, Stew, D's P.D., Freaky-G
The whole world wanna be rappin' with me
I'm in the flesh, let's talk about sex
Babies havin' babies generation X
With the AIDS epidemic we ain't pure no more
And I know they got a cure for this shit
We ain't rich irst we lost Eazy
Then we lost Pac, Biggie got killled
When this shit gon stop?
Everybody wanna know what's goin' on with the Thuggish Ruggish
Bone, bone, bone, bone tryin' to be prepared for the Y2K
And if I don't die today, I'm tryin' to change the world
And let's change the world
And let's change the world
(World)
Let's change the world
(World)
Let's change the world
Let's change the world
Let's change the world
(World)
Let's change the world, let's change the world
(World)
Wish you need a lesson you can learn from rappin'
But they try to ban it, realize that it ain't gon' happen
We done changed the world
Ghetto voices bein' heard and failed
Know it's funny, got my guns, better arm yourself
Most don't have a clue, if it goes down what to do
Don't you know this government ain't vote for me and you
I have a dream, no, I have a wish
If we can't save ourselves, then let's save the kids
Let the world go, let these babies have somethin'
Let the world go, just don't blow this muthafucka up
You kill him, he'll kill you
Some say it stupid but violence really lives where I come from
Hungry little kids where I come from
Thugs like me where I come from
See we losing this world we love
And it looks like the sinnin' won't end
So I'm reachin' high up above
Lord let your blessings begin
And let's change the world
And let's change the world
(World)
Let's change the world
(World)
Let's change the world
Let's change the world
Let's change the world
(World)
Let's change the world, let's change the world
