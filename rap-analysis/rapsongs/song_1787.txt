Don't do it dog, it's just not worth it
What the fuck have they done?
Now, don't you ever fuck around
Now, don't you ever fuck around
Nigga don't you ever fuck around
Now, don't you ever fuck around
Now, don't you ever fuck around
Now, don't you ever fuck around
Nigga don't you ever fuck around
Now, don't you ever fuck around
Aiyyo, I got a mean flow that'll drown niggaz, put down niggaz
Can't stand to be around niggaz if they clown niggaz
How many times, must I break the same niggaz off some dumb
So we know, where the fuck I'm comin' from?
Gun and ones, watch a black niggaz turn purple
With this fo pound, I bust mo rounds, in the circle
The niggaz that tried is the same niggaz that fried
So he'll never rest in peace 'cause of the way that he died
I'm Evil, like Kneival, fagot I'll leave you
Like I should've did your peoples before they could conceive you
How's a buck fifty sound, for a quick ass cut?
Here's a flashback, I fuckin' blow your bitch ass up
And it's no problem, handlin' a niggaz with a death wish
Leave him breathless, and hit his wife with a dead fish
Must I show this niggaz, I can throw this niggaz, I'll blow this niggaz
You can get it too, 'cause you know this niggaz
Now, don't you ever fuck around
Now, don't you ever fuck around
Nigga don't you ever fuck around
Now, don't you ever fuck around
Now, don't you ever fuck around
Now, don't you ever fuck around
Nigga don't you ever fuck around
Now, don't you ever fuck around
I get pumped, just like a bodybuilder
And it's been more than a couple of times my pump shottie spilt a
Niggaz guts on the door, because he wanted more
Than he could stand, now him and his man is on the floor
That's what you get for talkin' shit you shouldn't got me started
You motherfuckers never wanted nuttin', but you got it
I shit on niggaz like a toilet
'Cause all it takes, is a second for it to get hectic so call it
How you want it?  Punk bitch talkin' junk bitch
Fuck around and you'll be found in a trunk bitch
Niggaz is off brand like no frills
And I got more skills to show my fo kills, my fuckin' fo thrills
Got some cold shit, have you like "Oh shit!", don't laugh money
When I'm done with this nigga, I'm gettin' in yo' shit
Break niggaz, especially fake niggaz over dumb shit
With one hit, watch the dum dum split this bum's shit
Now, don't you ever fuck around
Now, don't you ever fuck around
Nigga don't you ever fuck around
Now, don't you ever fuck around
Now, don't you ever fuck around
Now, don't you ever fuck around
Nigga don't you ever fuck around
Now, don't you ever fuck around
Fuckin' see some cats thinkin' the worst
Dumb cats, them cats sleep in a hearse
Where yo' guns at?  Run that, see a niggaz thirst
Been there, done that, and did it first
Niggaz can't tell me shit about this
And I keep somethin' that'll hit, if I miss
One thin' a niggaz stay with is hot shit
Got this, what you cats want? Not this
I constantly got to remind young niggaz
Uhh uhh, don't do that, some niggaz
Think 'cause I ain't killed a nigga this week that shit is sweet
Fuck around, you'll be dead in the street
Red with a sheet, over the corpse
Shit is deep, so I shed a tear, over the loss
If you creep, then you know niggaz will roll with the force
Should've paid that money that you owed to the boss
Now, don't you ever fuck around
Now, don't you ever fuck around
Nigga don't you ever fuck around
Now, don't you ever fuck around
Now, don't you ever fuck around
Nigga don't you ever fuck around
Nigga don't you ever fuck around
Now, don't you ever fuck around
Uhh huh, don't do it dog, it's just not worth it
Please heh, for your sake, hey hey
You know?  Come on
