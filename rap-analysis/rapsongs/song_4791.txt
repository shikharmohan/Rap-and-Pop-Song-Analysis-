Time and time again
I keep trying to put you out of my mind
I can't concentrate
You're the only feeling I can find
And it's taking over, rolling me over
Seems like it won't stop
And I've lost control of my heart and soul
'Cause when I see your eyes, then I know I want you
When I hear your voice
That's when I know I want you
Losing all my defenses
You're slipping back inside of my head
It's getting, so I can't exist
Without the thought of us together again
And it's taking over, rolling me over
Seems like it won't stop
When I feel your touch
Then I know I want you
Then I know I want you
I want you
In my life, it's been so uncertain
Ties were broken and it left me hurting
Maybe now I can trust again with you
And it's taking over, rolling me over
Seems like it won't stop
When I feel your touch
Then I know I want you
Then I know I want you
I want you
'Cause when I see your eyes
Then I know I want you
When I hear your voice
That's when I know I want you
When I feel your touch
Then I know I want you
Then I know I want you
I want you
