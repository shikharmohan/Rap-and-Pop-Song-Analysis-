My reality is bigger than your dreams are
Got ya dream girl ridin' in your dream car
She wants me, she wants me 
Cause I got it all,
Bitch tell me what you don't see.

I got 25 lighters on my dresser
Got the ? in the ? to undress her
My guitar strap is leather
My life is better than ever
I got women all up in my condo
And my drug dealer comes pronto. 
Got a registered pistol in my console 
So, so, don't try me now 
don't try me now
