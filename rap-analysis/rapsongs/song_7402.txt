Shh, shh, shh, shh, Wu, Wu, Tang, Tang
The joy the flowers bring me, the pain still has me sinkin'
All while my heart gently weeps
Your smile has got me shrinkin', the tears in your eyes are twinklin'
Because the heart gently weeps
Snowy night, fiends basin', a raisin' in the sun was amazin'
The joint on the dresser, a gauge went off
Jumped up, fish tank, it fell and they stuck
They shot her cousin LaVon, he owed a buck
Willie was awful, pulled out the ratchet, let off two
Grits fell on his leg, Kiana ripped the cold bowl
He violent, an Island nigga with the talent
Of six killas who just came home, from straight whylin'
Robbin' everythin' in Macy's, Lacy, short haircut
With long arms who fuck niggaz, got four babies
Yvette jabbed her, slapped her wig off, ran in the crib
She did the dumb shit, my nigga then clapped her
Lester, smoked Chester sister Vest, I heard it was a mess
They ripped the apple out her throat, blessed her
Hungry hyenas from Medina, all eight trainers
Who got reluct', think fast and blast from Beamers
I brought my bitch out to Pathmark, she's pushin' the cart
Headed to aisle four, damn I got milk on my Clark's
That's what I get, not focusin' from hittin' that bar
My mouth dried, need plenty water quick, I feel like a shark
In the aisle bustin' them paper towels and wipin' my Wally's down
I stood up to face a barrel, he's holdin' a shiny pound
It's him, he want revenge, I murdered his Uncle Tim
I sold him a bag of dope, his wife came and copped again
That bitch is crazy and uh, she brought her baby
She knew I hard the murders, a smack
It killed her man though, now I got his fuckin' nephew grippin' his gat
You's a bitch, you better kill me, you know you're booty
You pulled your toolie, out on me motherfucker
First thought was to snatch the ratchet
Said fuck it and fuckin' grabbed it
I ducked, he bucked twice, this nigga was fuckin laughin'
I wrestled him to the ground, tussle, scuffle, constantly kicked him
He wouldn't let go the joint, so I fuckin' bit him
Shots was whizzin', hittin' Clorox bottles
Customers screamin', then the fagot ran out of hollows
I had to show him what it's all about
Next thing you read in the paper
A man who came to kill gets knocked out
I don't know why nobody told you
Man's not supposed to cry
Though we're just babies and you're so crazy
How tears of joy bring so much life
You on your way to the store nigga
Grab me a Dutch, I'm mad as fuck
My dude, my count was short when I was baggin' it up
Now I need liquor, nigga pass me a cup
What's up with Officer Brown?
The other day he tried to shackle me up
He killed Kase and now he hasslin' us
This motherfucker got balls
Even the gall to try and pattin' me up
Time to re-up, let these niggaz
Know we back on the block
With three hundred off a G-pack
Crack in the spot
I don't know why, nobody told you
Man's not supposed to cry
Though we're just babies and you're so crazy
How tears of joy bring so much life
The joy the flowers bring me, the pain still has me sinkin'
All while my heart gently weeps
Your smile has got me shrinkin', the tears in your eyes are twinklin'
Because the heart gently weeps
