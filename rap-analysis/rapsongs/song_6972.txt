You think you do,well you're probably wrong
I'm surrounded my babies than Ashanti songs
Oh baby, I know ya don't get it

Radio suckers never play me 'cause I don't let them
They're like a pimp only hoes sweat them
When I do a show I like to catch the ladies eyes
Dodge the paparazzi, I don't want to see no lady die
Sports, entertainment, academics, business or politics
Ya find hoes that swallow dick for dollars quick
Young broads, roll up in gangs, like the Young Lords
Jump off, statutory rape, now you done for
What, you thought that your shorty was going to act her age?
No, right now, somebody's daughter is backstage
  (Yup)
It's a master-slave relationship, but guess who's Toby?
  (Yup)
It's the white girl in Colorado, but guess who's Kobe?
Tried to tell you not to fuck with these debutants
That's more Kobe beef than Japanese restaurants
Don't need diseases or cases, ain't trying to catch nothing
And when they're throwing pussy best believe you catching something

And just crack him across his forehead
And I'll be like, yeah Talib
