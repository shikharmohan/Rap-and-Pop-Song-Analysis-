Introducin', the Almighty, 7 0 7
We in the buildin'
Go go go go go go go go go, hey hey
Go hard, go hard, go hard, go hard
Ooh, verbal vomit, I keep it one hundred
Dr. Scrill but you can call me Ebonics
Sideshows goin' nutty dumbin' out
Take the wrong turn and get your roof stomped out
Old school vans doors open, me in my Coupe
With some stoners we get high like Shaggy from Scooby Doo
I'm whiskeyed, I'm hit, I ain't go no patience
Pimpin' I'm a couple of tacos short of a combination
Get on yo' head like a shower from the gravel
When them scandalous dope deals be goin' sour
Recount, swivel, Gold Medal Flour
Want the fast quarter, fuck a slow nickel, six bucks an hour
From the rooter to the tooter
He's the driver, I'm the shooter, don't be fuckin' with my gouda
Ballergasms, side pots, and trill phones
Sidekicks and ringtones, go hard or go home
Go hard or go home, go hard
Go hard or go home, go hard
Go hard or go home, go hard
Go hard or go home, go hard
Go hard or go home, go hard
Go hard or go home, go hard
Go hard or go home, go hard
Go hard or go home
From the boom to the moon I coon like [Incomprehensible]
My goons take no prisoners, what fool?
What's beef? Beef is when E-40 on a fat verse
Swing 'em in the drive through, smashed up further
Gettin' off, if you from the Yay, that's North
Open up the do's, go, four on low
Four-fo' heat sick, monkey on my back
Psychos all on milk, won't let me go
Down my throat, yes, 'cuz, buzz
What, I, go, numb
Slack hoes like Droop-E's
Put in thumb, run it back like Rick on the NPC, go hard
Go hard or go home, go hard
Go hard or go home, go hard
Go hard or go home, go hard
Go hard or go home, go hard
Go hard or go home, go hard
Go hard or go home, go hard
Go hard or go home, go hard
Go hard or go home
Like I did it, originally
We jumpin' on the top of your scrape-ella deuce
Three or four niggaz tryin' to cave in your roof
We jumpin' on the top of your scrape-ella deuce
Three or four niggaz tryin' to cave in your roof
We jumpin' on the top of your scrape-ella deuce
Three or four niggaz tryin' to cave in your roof
We jumpin' on the top of your scrape-ella deuce
Three or four niggaz tryin' to cave in your roof
Little purple, cuss like a sailor
Hammer on my waist, Tim the Toolman Taylor
Get rich, hate bein' po'
'Cause my bitch keep askin' for juicy couture
In the club, you know we strapped up
My white tee shirt look like coke wrapped up
Forces and jeans, can't wear slacks
Got good hair, no wave cap
This whole block, standin' on the curb
Same niggaz with me I been knowin' since the 3rd
Tryin' to get it, sucks bein' bummy
Never shoulda gave you niggaz money
Bop B's, rock C's, drop H's
Grind more than Haitians or Jamaicans
Ain't about money then ain't got patience
Don't bring money then don't have relations
Some like Hannibal, I'm a mammal
Ain't with monkeys like Mike and Emmanuel
Change the channel, rearrange panels
Oh-seven like the perm on cavi
Your bitch babby, she don't bring patties
She can't ride shotgun in the Brougham Caddy
Put my nigga in, let him campaign
And don't cut him off like Jay did Dane
Go hard or go home, go hard
Go hard or go home, go hard
Go hard or go home, go hard
Go hard or go home, go hard
Go hard or go home, go hard
Go hard or go home, go hard
Go hard or go home, go hard
Go hard or go home
Sick wid it
