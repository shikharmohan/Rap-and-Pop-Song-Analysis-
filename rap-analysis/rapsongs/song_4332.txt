Mic check 1, 2 on the way to third
Flow sick; put a straight jacket on my words
So sick, they think that something's in the herb
They think i'm gone, but i'm fine like a woman's curves
My personality is far from your reality, i'm closer to your girl,
now come on ho don't embarrass me! There is no comparising
This right here be kerosene, carousel, parasail, im higher than everything
When I spit u cant drink it like your 17
I can show a million pair of eyes that they've never seen,
And I can do this in whatever the weather brings
Picasso couldn't paint a better scene, colossal
Now give me the mike and i'll rock like a fuckin fossil
I'm mad at the track, and i'll beat it like H
