[Lil Wayne talking]
I like my seat down low and my windows lightly cracked
Ridin wit a bad hoe and her girlfriend in the back 
I like to get real high and neva look back
And u don't wanna try me don't I look strapped
I come from the hardest city ain't nobody fuckin wit it 
Got a black and gold sole and a fresh New Orleans fitte,
A collared polo and a pair of bally bucks 
Young money muthafucka know ya worried bout us
Cash money muthafucka 
C.M.R. I trust
Neva had my jaw broken but its jaw i bust 
and i probably got ya girlfriend on my bus
What happens on my bus stays on my bus
And that white widow weed out the jar is a must
If u gimme a cigar than a cigar i bust
Put that white widow weed in the cigar and puff
Look ma im tryin to make a porno starrin us 
Well not just us a couple foreign sluts
We could make the summer manal n trallin ya'll
And i be wit jim jones and we be ballin ballin 
Yea Baby we ballin like rawlins and spaldins 
Pint of dj screw and that hawiian 
I am leannin like a three Legged lion climbin 
Right to the top of the muthafuckin mountain countin
I'm gonna need an accountant to count it, 
Manny got this fuckin beat poundin 
It's poundin but it was just lost until i found it, found it
Stole it like a scoundrel holly grove hounded put
This bitch to sleep fu*kin rite i nite gowned it
Niggas talking cheap tell them niggas pipe down bitch
Bloods in the building and every body soundless 
Beatin up the track like a muthafuckin round fist
Blind, deaf or crazy ima spit like a long kiss
I am just a martian ain't nobody else on this
Planet i know see i live by my only 
Where my cheese nigga where my macaroni 
Baby i get up In that ass and act a donkey 
Candy on candy nigga
Gripin the grain see i am the only fire that can
Live in the rain i am so so New Orleans 
Like 1825 Tulane
[Lil Wayne talking]
See ya gotta be from new Orleans to know what fuck I'm talking bout
If you don't then fuck you, I say what I want
