[VERSE 1:]
I love the fancy underwear
I sit behind her every year
waiting for the chance to get
to tell her Im the one she should be with
shes popular with all the guys
so innocent in my eye
I could see her in my life
she wouldve had the perfect sweet man
but
see she had other plans
I could not understand
her and her stupid friends
varsitys biggest fans
[CHORUS:]
never forget the day
she laughed and walked away
and I couldnt stop her
I guess she had it all
she had it all figured out
but she left me with a broken heart
fucked around and turned me down
cuz she didnt think I could play the part
but now the prom queen the prom queen
is crying sittin outside of my door
see you never know how
how everything could turn around
[VERSE 2:]
uhh
they loved her fancy underwear
every boyfriend every year
she tried to keep em entertained
when they can hardly remember her name
she did everything she could just to
to make him love and treat her good
she found herself alone
askin herself where did she go wrong
she didnt realize
she chased the type of guys
that dont believe in ties
tryin to apologize
CHORUS:]
never forget the day
she laughed and walked away
and I couldnt stop her
I guess she had it all
she had it all figured out
but she left me with a broken heart
fucked around and turned me down
cuz she didnt think i could play the part
but now the prom queen the prom queen
is crying sittin outside of my door
see you never know how
how everything could turn around
she had it all figured out
but she left me with a broken heart
fucked around and turned me down
cuz she didnt think i could play the part
but now the prom queen the prom queen
is crying sittin outside of my door
see you never know how
how everything could turn around
