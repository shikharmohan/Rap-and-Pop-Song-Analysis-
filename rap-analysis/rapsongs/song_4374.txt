[VERSE 1 - Lil Wayne:]
Back the hell off
Rock n roll Jesus with all my nails on
all I need is a blunt and a bail bond
and give these blind motherfuckers something to feel on
Rollin like a motherfucker put your wheels on
and lets roll down and heal till the heal gone
I started on the block but that something to build on
and how can I pray when I got nothing to kneel on
[Chorus - Lil Wayne:]
hey
The ground is gone
donÃÂ¢€t look now but the ground is gone
IÃÂ¢€m so high that the ground is gone
and I donÃÂ¢€t even know which crowd IÃÂ¢€m on
donÃÂ¢€t look down but the ground is gone
donÃÂ¢€t look down cause the ground is gone
right now IÃÂ¢€m a million miles from home
and IÃÂ¢€m so high that the ground is gone
[VERSE 2 - Tyga:]
Son look up
father just shook us
never was around like bush is
war just came like Kane with bishop
movies too different to act not used ta
boys in the hood messed up
no blueprints they just do it,
then they get commercial shootin
ruthless, live your T.I. or lose it
stupid people like yaÃÂ¢€ll once knew ÃÂ¢€Ãem
who da, new nigga is show and prove it,
never skateboard but I grinds in these Supras,
YaÃÂ¢€ll niggas foolin, for fame and the fortune,
super human, 430 flame horses
ready to use it, L.A. to Jerusalem
Betty Bootin, my girls fake Hollywood tits
couldnÃÂ¢€t fool ÃÂ¢€Ãem, I just pull up
and I hold her, yeah, and adjust, to the mood
[BRIDGE - Lil Wayne:]
Jump-Jump out a window
Lets-Lets-Lets jump off a building baby
Lets Jump-Jump out a window
Lets jump off a building baby
Jump-Jump out a window
Lets-Lets-Lets jump off a building baby
Lets Jump-Jump out a window
Lets jump off a building baby
[Chorus - Lil Wayne:]
hey
The ground is gone
donÃÂ¢€t look now but the ground is gone
IÃÂ¢€m so high that the ground is gone
and I donÃÂ¢€t even know which crowd IÃÂ¢€m on
donÃÂ¢€t look down but the ground is gone
donÃÂ¢€t look down cause the ground is gone
right now IÃÂ¢€m a million miles from home
and IÃÂ¢€m so high that the ground is gone
[VERSE 3 - Lil Wayne:]
I know a girl named Crystal her last name Paul
I look into her eyes and I can see it all
I see it when she cry, IÃÂ¢€m there when she call
cause I live inside of the mirror on the wall
