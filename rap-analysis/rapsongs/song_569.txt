Jeremiah 10: 23, 24, we will know, oh Lord
That to earthly men, His way does not belong
It does not belong to man
Who must walk and even to direct his step
Correct me, oh Jehovah
However with judgment not in anger
That You may not reduce us to nothing
Order my steps in Your world
Order my steps in Your world, dear Lord
Lead me, guide me everyday
Send your anointing, Father, I pray
Order my steps in Your world
Why am I payin' this price for fame? Now with the shame
I'm to blame 'cause I'm solo empty
When I can stop and give it all to Christ
'Cause in His name no weapon should be formed against me
Simply know that the world gon' tempt me
Satan is the enemy, God please help us
I don't wanna be selfish
I don't wanna live my life tryin' to be rebellious
Who be checkin' when you know you doin' wrong, huh?
Got your steps, give your blessings
Know right from wrong, turn the lights on
All you gotta do is follow faith till they call us all home
But it's so hard, temptation is everywhere
Gotta hold my guard like, oh my God
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Now I might not make it to Heaven
But I'm tryin' to come back in the resurrection
Take my place in Paradise
So I pray to God, try to change my life
But temptation make it hard for me to make it out
Man, I gotta quit lustin', I need to stop smokin'
I need God's guidance, without it, I'm hopeless
I'm lone and about world zonin' it out, I'm gone
Lord, please help me stand strong
Order my steps in Your world, dear Lord
Lead me, guide me everyday
Send your anointing, Father, I pray
Order my steps in Your world
A lotta soldiers in the pen, ain't ever comin' home
Can you find it in your heart to pray?
So it seems everything goin' wrong
And you're just tryin' to find your way
Momma just wanna feed her babies
Tryin' to keep a safe place to stay
Don't stress, it's a test, God bless
All you really gotta do is just keep your faith
You can feel it if you open up
You can get it if you need love
As much as a mustard seed is all you need
Small price to pay for the air that we breathe
And the baby is born, place to go when we leave
Food that we eat, weapon when we sleep
It's a miracle, no believe in the Lord
Hey, what cha seein' on the news
Has been already written in the Bible
But ain't nobody takin' the time to realize
That believin' and readin' the Scriptures
Could mean your survival
And I don't wanna die, no never
I wanna live forever and I want a life better
So when Armageddon really come true, whatchu gon' do?
Order my steps in Your world, dear Lord
Lead me, guide me everyday
Send your anointing, Father, I pray
Order my steps in Your world
Order my steps
Lead me, guide me everyday
Send Your anointing, Father, I pray
Order my steps in Your world
Swing low, swing low
  (He loves me)
Swing low, swing low
Swing low, swing low
  (He loves me)
Swing low, swing low
  (For the Bible tells me so)
Swing low
You know God is good, you know God is great
And everyday I wake, I gotta thank Him for my life
And even though it's hard, I know I make mistakes
I give it everything it takes just to make it right
This is Satan's land, understand the plan, y'all
Jesus comin' back with a furious mind
Better praise everyday, hurry doin' your job
Glory to the King, that's my Heavenly Father
He's comin' back soon, here I am
Order my, order my
Order my steps in Your world, dear Lord
