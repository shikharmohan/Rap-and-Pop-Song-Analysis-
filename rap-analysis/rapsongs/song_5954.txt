This right here 
Goes out 
To everyone 
That has lost someone that they truly love 
Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show 
I laced the track and you locked the flow 
So far from hanging on the block for dough 
Notorious they got to know that life ain't always what it seems to be 
Words can't express what you mean to me 
Even though you're gone, we still a team 
Through your family I'll fulfil dreams 
In the future can't wait to see if you open up the gates for me 
Reminisce sometime the night they took my friend 
Try to black it out but it plays again 
When it's real, feelin's hard to conceal 
Can't imagine all the pain I feel 
Give anything to hear half your breath, 
I know your still livin' your live after death 
Every step I take 
Every move I make 
Every single day, Every time I pray 
I'll be missing you 
Thinking of the day 
When you went away 
What a life to take 
What a bond to break 
I'll be missing you 
Its kinda hard with you not around 
I know you're in Heaven smiling down 
Watchin' us while we pray for you 
Everyday we pray for you 
Till the day we meet again 
In my heart is were I keep you friend 
Memories give me the strength I need to proceed 
Strength I need to believe 
My thoughts Big, I just can't define 
Wish I could turn back the hands of time 
Us and a six, shop for new clothes and kicks 
You and me take in flicks 
Make a hit, stages they receive you on 
Still can't believe you're gone 
Give anything to hear half your breath 
I know you're still livin' your life after death 
Every step I take 
Every move I make 
Every single day, Every time I pray 
I'll be missing you 
Thinking of the day 
When you went away 
What a life to take 
What a bond to break 
I'll be missing you 
Somebody tell me why 
On that morning, when this life is over 
I know 
I'll see your face 
Every night I pray 
Every step I take 
Every move i make
Every single day 
I miss you 
Every step I take 
Every move I make 
Every single day, Every time I pray 
I'll be missing you 
Thinking of the day 
When you went away 
What a life to take 
What a bond to break 
I'll be missing you 
Every step I take 
Every move I make 
Every single day, Every time I pray 
I'll be missing you 
Thinking of the day 
When you went away 
What a life to take 
What a bond to break 
I'll be missing you 
Every step I take 
Every move I make 
Every single day, Every time I pray 
I'll be missing you 
Thinking of the day 
When you went away...(fade)
