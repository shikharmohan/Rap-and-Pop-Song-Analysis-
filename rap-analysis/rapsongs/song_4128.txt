[Lil Wayne talking]
Yea yea yea its the Carter motherf**ker I came back around
its the Carter motherf**ker I came back around
its the Carter motherf**ker
let me show you my building man, its the Carter
I'ma show y'all the ins the outs the ups the down, kno what I'm
talkin bout
this is me fourth solo album baby, I came back around
by myself this time, back off the wall
guns up in the air in the middle of the streets like bang bang bang, welcome
[Verse 1]
This is the Carter y'all welcome, hard as Malcolm
Dawg is a vulcan Lord help him but y'all felt him
And That make you a part of me and pardon me
If a part of me is what you wanna be what you oughtta be
Dont worry Carter me I just actin accordingly
I give orders to the commander in chief, just the commander in
me
Handlin streets in the mandarin V
I hear you haters slanderin me I just hand him the P
Any drama I pace it like Indiana, I take your grandma pacemaker
and jus handle the piece
Not two fingers I simultaneously pop two bangers
You do not want anger USDA prime beef, ya dead meat
I'm so ahead of these trendy rappers speed up
I'm already hot when another one startin to heat up
Got Mannie hot wit me 'cause I always beat his beat up
Yall cats wit y'all feet up startin to look like feet up, I'm
G'd up from the feet up
In the truck gotta put my seat up
In the trunk I got my base and I ain't speakin about no speakers
But speakin about your speakers there's the speech of Weezy F.
Baby
No more no less Baby, so forth and so on
Front door livin room young nigga switchin we
What you need, get you crack get you weed
Make yo way to the back look ahead and see
White bitch in the bathroom givin head for speed
But don't you turn your head at me, the president been doin it
Then he tried to ruin it
But I built this building from the roots
I own all the corners and the cuts in this motherf**ker
And the feds know just whats up in this motherf**ker
Made niggaz so they cant bust in this motherf**ker
So with that lets keep it movin, on to the kitchen where my
witches keep it brewin
Uh huh look at how my bitches do it
Bucky buck naked look at all my bitches booties
They handle all my pharmaceutics
I got it from promethazane to metamucil
I'm crucial don't mean to spook you
But this is New Orleans so my queens do voodoo, ya know
So the things just move through
I feel ya pain I got things to soothe you
That fills the cane so wayne the neutral
Dont hate the game hate the institution
That fills the cane so wayne the nuetral
Dot hate the game hate the institution, f**ka
[Lil Wayne talking]
I came back around, it's the Carter
show you the rest of the house later, we gon go upstairs, ya
kno
Ya kno what this is right
Tha Carter..tha Carter...tha Carter
