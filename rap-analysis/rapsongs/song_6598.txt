These niggas quick to air you out and lay you down round here
You run your mouth, niggas will put you in the ground round here
One time, don't even fuck around and come round here

M, L and 21st where niggas worst
Quick to put one in you first
Before they search your pockets, get that china
And where they got cha, that's where they gonna find ya
They rollin' up that nigga, that's the real shit
Or bein' slick can get you caught up real quick
Hold up, homie, don't let this money blind ya
'Cause you won't see me standin' right behind ya
Then it's times up, that's how we talkin' if he come from the Beach
Betta watch them niggas out here if they come from the East
Don't stop if I'm not out some where, so niggas can see
'Cause they don't give a fuck, you stuck if you ain't with me
My city's a beast
You can't walk through the Beach unless you walk with a piece
You can't talk to police 'cause most police is like me
They get that cheddar like they want it, take your shit in the street
They want that paper out here
Enough to come and take what's on your plate out here
Enough to have somebody take your place out here
Fuckin' around without your strap sound like a bad idea
It ain't safe to leave the house, fuck around round here
These niggas quick to air you out and lay you down round here
You run your mouth, niggas will put you in the ground round here
One time, don't even fuck around and come round here
It ain't safe to leave the house, fuck around round here
These niggas quick to air you out and lay you down round here
You run your mouth, niggas will put you in the ground round here
One time, don't even fuck around and come round here
Don't fuck around, round here
This L.A. County, nigga
If you'se a bitch then get your ass from round here, nigga
Before they come put bullets in your brain
'Cause in the hood ain't nothing really change
They tryin' to get that paper just like Uncle Sam
And just like Sam, niggas just don't give a damn
They mission is to leave your ass in pain
'Cause they don't give a fuck about a thang, it's a cold game
That's how they talkin' if they walk on the West
Betta watch yourself when out there, start protectin' your chest
These niggas come from nowhere get to takin' your shit
You get beat outside the set and that's it, homie, you're stretched
This shit is a mess
You can't walk in them streets unless you walk with your vest
You can't talk to police 'cause most police ain't gon' stress
They get that cheddar like they want it with they foot in your chest
They want that paper out here
Enough to come and take what's on your plate out here
Enough to have somebody take your place out here
Fuckin' around without your strap sound like a bad idea
It ain't safe to leave the house, fuck around round here
These niggas quick to air you out and lay you down round here
You run your mouth, niggas will put you in the ground round here
One time, don't even fuck around and come round here
It ain't safe to leave the house, fuck around round here
