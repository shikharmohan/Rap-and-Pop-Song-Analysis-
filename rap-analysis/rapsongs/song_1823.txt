Uhh, used to be my dogg, you was in my left titty
Screamed, "Ryde or die", I thought you would die wit' me
Found out you a bitch, you can't even ryde wit' me
Now it's a war, and you ain't on the side wit' me
Used to be my dogg, you was in my left titty
Screamed, "Ryde or die", I thought you would die wit' me
Found out you a bitch, you can't even ryde wit' me
Now it's a war, and you ain't on the side wit' me
When it rain, niggaz get wet, so stay dry
Don't cross me, I compete to snake eye
You just lost me, like yo' shadow in the dark
Fucked around and forced me to hit the shadow wit' the spark
Blew your shit apart, now it's two halves of one nigga
"Look at him," I said after a few laughs, "Dumb nigga"
Stupid is as stupid does, cocksucker
And look what being stupid does, get you shot sucker
I let you get too close and you bit me
I told you nah for too long, you tried to hit me
Thought you was wit' me
Well you might as well forget me, 'cause from this point on
It's war, it won't stop until one of us is gone
I'm still mad at myself for lettin' that shit go down
Somebody shoulda told me, I was fuckin' wit' a clown
And I think they found and let, you, nigga drown
You know how shit get around
Used to be my dogg, you was in my left titty
Screamed, "Ryde or die", I thought you would die wit' me
Found out you a bitch, you can't even ryde wit' me
Now it's a war, and you ain't on the side wit' me
Used to be my dogg, you was in my left titty
Screamed, "Ryde or die", I thought you would die wit' me
Found out you a bitch, you can't even ryde wit' me
Now it's a war, and you ain't on the side wit' me
Aiyyo, X fuck them niggaz, them niggaz ain't your dogs
Better treat like some cats and shake they ass to the floor
Been seen the foul shit, put the guns in 'em
Lil' wannabe you's, so why you run wit' 'em?
You can't trust niggaz, no further than you can throw 'em
You don't wanna murder the niggaz, then you blow 'em
He usin' yo' style, that make him yo' child
Then he shouldn't make a move 'til he hear it from yo' mouth
We don't allow snakes, runnin' wit' dogs
Tell them ain't nuttin' like a funeral that's gonna be yours
Double-R, and I ain't here to start trouble God
But if they wasn't your niggaz I woulda been hit 'em hard
Niggaz look like they phony, sound like they phony
Run around actin' like motherfucker's homies
We all make mistakes, that's part of the breaks
But you can still call the apes, we bringin' the duct tape
And the broomstick, them bitch-ass niggaz is gettin' raped
Know how we ride, whoever on they side can die
And we ain't tryin' to be blind, fuck eye for eye
'Cause we only takin' yours, you know the doggs you motherfucker
Used to be my dogg, you was in my left titty
Screamed, "Ryde or die", I thought you would die wit' me
Found out you a bitch, you can't even ryde wit' me
Now it's a war, and you ain't on the side wit' me
Used to be my dogg, you was in my left titty
Screamed, "Ryde or die", I thought you would die wit' me
Found out you a bitch, you can't even ryde wit' me
Now it's a war, and you ain't on the side wit' me
There was always somethin' there, but I just couldn't touch it
Wasn't somethin' that would hurt me, so a nigga said, "Fuck it"
I let it slide, laughed and joked let it ride
Now that you done killed it, I'm glad that it died
It's aight, I know where you live, I'm just waitin'
'Til we knock on your front door, and let you meet Satan
That's what you get for hatin', fuck you faggot
I never did trust you faggot, I'll bust you faggot
What you done forgot about the streets is this:
You do a drimy nigga like you do a grimy bitch
You just S T O P fuckin wit' him, you got no more rap
No more, "Yo whassup D?", No more dap
Be lucky if I don't spit in your face, off of G.P.
And what? Bitch-ass nigga, you can't beat me
Don't take it as a loss, just take it as a lesson
Next time think twice, or get iced wit' the Wessun, nigga
Used to be my dogg, you was in my left titty
Screamed, "Ryde or die", I thought you would die wit' me
Found out you a bitch, you can't even ryde wit' me
Now it's a war, and you ain't on the side wit' me
Used to be my dogg, you was in my left titty
Screamed, "Ryde or die", I thought you would die wit' me
Found out you a bitch, you can't even ryde wit' me
Now it's a war, and you ain't on the side wit' me, c'mon
