Here comes the boom, here comes the boom
Here comes the boom, here comes the boom
Here comes the boom, here comes the boom
Here comes the boom, here comes the boom
Here comes the boom, boomin', bouncin'
Stalkin', must walk in, hawk get to pouncin'
Get 'em where it counts and, hit 'em like a mountain
Spit 'em, have 'em spittin' out blood like a fountain
Don't look at me like that, we just might fight black
And that fight might end up in me takin' your life back
I don't go for the bullshit 'cause I've been down
And time is just too important to be fuckin' around
Talk nigga, I stomp a mud hole in your face
Motherfucker, rip your butt hole out of place
Cock the glock to your head, let off about two in it
Yeah, it's a dirty job but I just love doin' in
Here comes the boom, here comes the boom
Here comes the boom, here comes the boom
Here comes the boom, here comes the boom
Here comes the boom, here comes the boom
Here comes the boom, here comes the boom
Here comes the boom, here comes the boom
Here comes the boom, here comes the boom
Here comes the boom, here comes the boom
I did more kinds of war crimes
More times than in war times, went way before times
You know what's sad man, that I'm such a mad man
Bad man with that boom you never had man
Here comes the boom, here comes the boom
Here comes the boom, here comes the boom
Here comes the boom, here comes the boom
Here comes the boom, here comes the boom
Here comes the boom
Here comes the boom
Here comes the boom
