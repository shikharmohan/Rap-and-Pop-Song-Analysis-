(Verse 1)
I used to love her.
Fuck it, I still do.
Cuz love never die.
But it can kill you.
I pray to heaven sky that it never kill me.
It can get you real weak, but fuck it, I'm a lil G.
My baby girl thought I was fucking every little freak.
But darling, I was raised by a woman, that ain't the real me.
Still she managed to spill out a little me.
Watched the doctors wipe the blood from her little feet.
God damn, she resembles me.
She's my forgiveness for every sin and penalty living in me.
She should be living with me.
But what am I to do, when her mother disagree.
I do me.
But
(Chorus)
How can something so right, go so wrong (x 4)
(Verse 2)
I even took your hand.
And walked down the aisle.
It takes a strong man.
To do that young and wild.
Look at your wedding band.
That 17 thousand.
But still she took the stand.
Now I pay for my child.
And there comes divorce.
Mama I had to file.
And as sad as it sounds, Mama I'm happy now.
And my other girl got a new baby daddy now.
And retaliation hurts, she getting married now.
And when I lay down to sleep.
I feel like I have died, I can be carried out, and buried now.
But here me now.
I am here and now.
So appealing til I dissapear, but still it got me feeling like.
(Chorus)
(Verse 3)
I'm in my early twenties.
And all the ladies dig me.
They like that baby face.
They like the baby in me.
That's why its Weezy Baby.
And please say the baby.
You know that nigga Baby.
Yea he done paid me crazy.
I won a few Source Awards, I haven't won an oscar.
So I don't know how to act like my sweet ain't sour.
So I run to my mama.
She let me smoke and fret bout' my drama, then give me power.
Imma go and use all my knowledge, and get acknowledged.
If the Pro ??? stop recording I'm still balling.
I know you probably don't care bout' where my heart is.
But just to let you know its where yours is.
(Chorus)
