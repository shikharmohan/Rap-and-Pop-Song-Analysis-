[Ludacris]
One day I love you, the next I can't stand you
It's too much for me to handle
I made my mind up, thinking I'm on the right track
So then I leave you, but then come right back
And I don't like that, I swear I'm so confused
Don't know what I want or what's the right thing to do
But the right thing is you, you're my destiny
Even at my worst you're still bringin' out the best of me
But then you testin' me, know how to push my buttons
Fussin', Fighting, ya hear we always getting into something
So mad i make you cry, then we make love
A never ending cycle, make up to break up
It's time to wake up, I need to smell the coffee
Play with these other women or get them all off me
And you wonder why your man don't just doubt ya
Can't live with ya, Can't live without ya
[Hook]
I can't live with ya (Can't live without you)
I can't live with ya (Can't live without you)
I can't live with ya (Can't live without you)
The one thing that I know is I can't seem to let you go
You drive me to the point I'm walking out my door
Then I find myself coming back for more
I don't know what to do
'Cause I can't live with ya I can't live without you
[Random R&B; dude]
Where the going gets tough and the fighting be rough
Most of them folks can't call it good but I guess we call it love
I'll be asking for your touch and I don't give you my trust
Must to hate you with a passion and I can't need you enough
I'll be.. want to spend my whole live with you
Then I'll be.. Talking about how you and me are through
And my mind says yes, but my heart says no
And my mind says walk, but my feet won't go away
See I'll be telling you to go, but deep inside I want you to stay
You know how to make me smile, but in time you ruin my day
We got to get better, got to get it together
And you wander why your girl don't just doubt you
I can't live with ya I can't live without you
[Hook]
I can't live with ya (Can't live without you)
I can't live with ya (Can't live without you)
I can't live with ya (Can't live without you)
the one thing that I know is I can't seem to let you go
You drive me to the point I'm walking out my door
Then I find myself coming back for more
I don't know what to do
'Cause I can't live with ya I can't live without you
