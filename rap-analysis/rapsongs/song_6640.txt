Dogg back up in this mother****
Hoes know how to act up in this mother****
They I know I make it crack up in this mother****
All blue Chuck's and my khakis in this mother****
I'm lookin' for a thick one
Pecan brown, she lookin' for the slim one
Loves to go down, she say she likes the big one
I need her right now, do you know where I can get one?
To give me brain like a genius
She love my hair pressed like the cleaners
And got a friend named Trina
You see 'em from behind you'll think they Venus and Serena
Now that's my kinda ****
Take your clothes off, damn baby, kinda thick
Love Snoopy blue, yeah I'm that type of Crip
And we was about to dip 'til she hit me with this trip
I ain't ever met another gangsta like you
I ain't really sure but I think I liked you
Give you my number to my cellular phone
Play my cards right, will you take me home?
Girl, you will never meet a gangsta like me
We can do our thing but you can't be wifey
Go and let your Doggy boy give you a bone
At the end of the night I'll take you home
I limp with my two step
Got two friends, we can have group sex
**** from the 2-1
Tall and skinny and always got blue on
Say I make cool songs
My nasty video made her do porn
And she go real far
Still can't believe that she's talkin' to a real star
Pop told me real hard
And threw that backshot on me real hard
Royal **** is clean, I'm king like the boulevard
Dogg do his thing, got her feelin' like a superstar
Wanna share her feelin's with her friends
Tell her husband that there's another man
And she say that I made her fall in love
I had to shake her fast like I wasn't when I was
A pimp from the beach, Gator shoes on my feet
Got my game from the streets, never been for a freak
Had the nerve to ask for money when I beat it up
I looked at the **** like cut, dat dat dat
I ain't ever met another gangsta like you
I ain't really sure but I think I liked you
Give you my number to my cellular phone
Play my cards right, will you take me home?
Girl, you will never meet a gangsta like me
We can do our thing but you can't be wifey
Go and let your Doggy boy give you a bone
At the end of the night I'll take you home
The homies say 'cuz don't do it to her
You gon' have to always do it to her
She be creepin' to your hotel, sayin' that she won't tell
Knowin' one night won't do it y'all
You know I got that gangsta
Make you wanna tell my mama, "Thank ya"
Then give me all your paper, every time I lay ya
Snoop Dogg, playa playa
I'm always with a bad ****
You could say I got a bad **** habit
See a bad ****, is like a fat blunt
I got one but you know I got to grab it
So lil' mama what's happenin'?
Let me know if you're tryin' to get it crackin'
Wanna chill, when you down for the smashin'?
Ms. American Gangsta, Mr. Blue Magic
I ain't ever met another gangsta like you
I ain't really sure but I think I liked you
Give you my number to my cellular phone
Play my cards right, will you take me home?
Girl, you will never meet a gangsta like me
We can do our thing but you can't be wifey
Go and let your Doggy boy give you a bone
At the end of the night I'll take you home
I ain't ever met another gangsta like you
I ain't really sure but I think I liked you
Give you my number to my cellular phone
Play my cards right, will you take me home?
Girl, you will never meet a gangsta like me
We can do our thing but you can't be wifey
Go and let your Doggy boy give you a bone
At the end of the night I'll take you home
Trick these a pac stay breezy up
In the club blowin' trees with Snoop
Cool lava poppin' enboddas rockin' T.R.
I'm at the bass go boom
I'm in a truck and I ain't stoppin'
Straight to my yatch let's get it poppin'
Cool lava poppin' enboddas rockin' T.R.
I'm at the bass go boom
You get it?
