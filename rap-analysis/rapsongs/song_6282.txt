Say, say
(Ooh)
Say, ooh
Say, say
(Ooh)
Say, ooh
Yeah, what's up baby?
Oh, I'm chillin'
You know, you got me thinkin' about you, right
Right
Word up, I wanna see you, what's up?
I'm ok, I'm chillin'
What we gon' do?
By yourself?
Yeah
What you up to
No, I'm just ridin'
Ridin', sexy, I'm that golden child
Hot '97, New York style
Got my head racin', thinking deep
'Bout them biceps, oh yes, you look sweet
Incredible, like edible, the best
Bar type, hard heart beatin' in my chest
Yes, blessed with that hardcore passion
Fingertips on my hips, lips reactin'
Goosebumps, pumps in the air
Love like this is rare, so I don't even care
Say ooh, I need to make you happy
You just so black and nappy
Come and get it, make it snappy
Cruisin', laid back, drop top, next fling
Head noddin' to the bomb, what's goin' on
Say ooh, I tell you what I do
You go get your crew and I'll go get my crew
Cruisin', laid back, drop top, next fling
Head noddin' to the bomb, you got it goin' on
Say ooh, I gotta get with you
What you wanna do? I'm feelin' it
Summertime in the city, I'm pretty
I'm hot, twelve o' clock
Lampin' in my drop top with my crew
Ooh, I should call my boo
Drivin' Jones Beach, have a sip or two
Skinny dip, trip, let the night flow
Maybe see a show, call your peep's yo
Champagne smooth, cruise around the way
So baby, what you say?
Can you come out and play?
I'm ready at dawn, let's get it on
We can break away, to the break of dawn
You're tryin' to flex, no sex, wanna chill
A feeling that you're real
You feeling what I feel
Cruisin', laid back, drop top, next fling
Head noddin' to the bomb, what's goin' on
Say ooh, I tell you what I do
You go get your crew and I'll go get my crew
Cruisin', laid back, drop top, next fling
Head noddin' to the bomb, you got it goin' on
Say ooh, I gotta get with you
What you wanna do? I'm feelin' it
Victoria Secret, I'm jiggy down to my skins
Smellin' good, pocket full of ends
I got you, you just come as you are
Gas tank full, I got a fast car
Up to par, the bubbly, some food
Your style's like smooth, put me in the mood
With your click, got my chicks, the pickin's
Flew in from D.C., wanna see how we be livin'
Whatever's clever, we be together
Show at the Apollo, make it last forever
Hit the supper club
(Yo, can I get a hug?)
Rub-a-dub at the Q, what's up with me and you?
Cruisin', laid back, drop top, next fling
Head noddin' to the bomb, what's goin' on
Say ooh, I tell you what I do
You go get your crew and I'll go get my crew
Cruisin', laid back, drop top, next fling
Head noddin' to the bomb, you got it goin' on
Say ooh, I gotta get with you
What you wanna do? I'm feelin' it
Got it goin' on
I wanna get with you
'Cuz I feel it
Yeah, when I hit your block, I dial you on my cell phone
The Best of Isley Brothers, got me in another zone
I'm all alone, cruisin', laid back, feel the need for your presence
The essence of your manhood, black, just like that, uh, yeah
Right here, baby
Right there, baby
Oh, all right
Hmm
You like that
Cruisin', laid back, drop top, next fling
Bangin' to the bomb, what's goin' on
Say ooh, I tell you what I do
You go get your crew and I'll go get my crew
Cruisin', laid back, drop top, next fling
Bangin' to the bomb, you got it goin' on
Say ooh, I gotta get with you
What you wanna do? I'm feelin' it
What's up, what you wanna do, yeah, yeah?
You got it goin' on
You've got me feeling you, oh yeah
