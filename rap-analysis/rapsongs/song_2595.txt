First time I seen your face, I was like, "Damn"
Put your arm around my waist, I was like, "Man"
Gentle with the touch I ain't fuss still a strong hand
I ain't know if I should lust or play it like a man
True, I'm human like you but gotta play it smart
Questions, I gotta ask before we get this start
Pulse racing fast, damn can you feel my heart
Got me feeling wild, yeah, you doin' your playa part
Tryin' to feel you up, excuse me, I mean feel you out
What your life like, tell me what your mind about
Oh, you ain't even trynna share no secrets straight to bis
Wifey, baby mother, you got any kids
One word answers, oh, I ain't feelin' that
Then the pain for American Express black
But I'm a play it cool and let you think you runnin' things
You seem official long as you ain't runnin' names
You ain't getting none
His touch it really turns me on
This message comes from me to you
Please stop touchin' on me
  (You know you want it)
But I got go
You ain't getting none
His touch it really turns me on
This message comes from me to you
Please stop touchin' on me
  (You know you want it)
But I got go
Listen, baby, you know that I'm attracted to you crazy
But I ain't gonna play stupid so you can try to play me
You ain't really tellin' me shit and trynna slay me
And on the real this quiet shit is startin' to drive me crazy
The only thing that's keepin' me still is sex appeal
Strong but silent type is that you what the deal you
Know what I like on me gotta keep it real
Somethin' in my mind sayin' that you probably got the skills
But I ain't givin' in, your friends they feminine
And I don't know how many of them you might be swimmin' in
But them lips though make me wanna try my luck
Straight thug what I love and you got me stuck
'Cause you dress right, I'm supposed to be pressed right
But on the real you got me thinkin' if I could be blessed tonight
Let me stop thinkin' these things it's not polite
I wanna give it to you raw but I'mma put up a fight
You ain't getting none
His touch it really turns me on
This message comes from me to you
Please stop touchin' on me
  (You know you want it)
But I got go
You ain't getting none
His touch it really turns me on
This message comes from me to you
Please stop touchin' on me
  (You know you want it)
But I got go
From subliminal seduction not really touchin'
But like rubbin' actin' like you wantin' nothin'
Your eyes say it all playboy but you no rushin'
Treat me like your pray only your sexual huntin'
I'm runnin', frontin', 'cause really I'm wantin' to
Let you lay me down pound for pound we be crushin'
I'm tight vexed, 'cause I'm really dwellin' on the sex
Chills up my spine the way you smellin' up my neck
I'm like putty in your hands, I gotta keep my composure
Plus I'm trynna remember how long I really known ya
You make it hard fightin' you off is like a job
But I'm doin good so far body startin' to throb
Should I give in ready to open my garage
And let you park in the dark but damn I gotta
Fight you off gotta roll out but before I leave
You need know that dinner was lovely but I really gotta go
You ain't getting none
His touch it really turns me on
This message comes from me to you
Please stop touchin' on me
  (You know you want it)
But I got go
You ain't getting none
His touch it really turns me on

But I got go
