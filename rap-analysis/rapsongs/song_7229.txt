Yeah, they say love blind, so why can't I picture this guhl mine?
Yeah, I dig her but I figure, I'm wastin' this guhl time
I'm runnin' from relationships, scared to commit
Mad at monogamy, sexually, I'm a misfit
But this shit's way too much fo' me
Usually I can take 'em and make 'em a cut buddy
Yo, mama probably see me and say that I'm no good
I was born in the burbs, I was raised in the hood
We from two separate sides of life, two different backgrounds
Shawty been legit and I just started to rap now
I ain't tryna act now, I'm bein' real witchu
Really, I just wanted to kick it and chill witchu
But the picture got bigger for I could even paint it
Thoughts got deeper befo' a nigga could think
A playa like me on this, strange ain't it?
One thang 'bout yo feelin's is this, you can't change it
Yo perception on me, I don't think I can maintain
We flirtin' with disaster, this game we playin' is dangerous
You the best thang that happened since I done became famous
But sometimes I think we shoulda remained strangers
I, I chooz u, baby
  (Oh, come on)
(Stay with me now, stay with me, sing it fo' me shawty)
I, I, I, I, I chooz u, baby
  ([Incomprehensible])
(Ah, come on, uh, uh, uh c'mon)
I like you to pursue but still I respect it to let it go
Give it time, give it room to breathe and let it grow
I'll just tell her when I'm ready to change, I'll let her know
Hate to say it, but 'til then be friends and nuthin' more
Even though another time, another life, another place
I swear I know we coulda been great
But rather than great, you lil heart take the smile of yo face
So I can treat you right, I'm willin' to wait
And ain't shit fake, I know it sound funny comin' from a felon
But I think, I got a piece of whuz up in heaven
So to keep from, blockin' mah blessings, think I better back up
Last thang a nigga need now is bad luck
But if my life was perfect shawty, I'da had her
I guess, I guess I don't deserve it, ballaz tell me, "You ain't worth it"
So I gots to hit the surface, I'll holla when I holla
Act like I don't wanna see ya and I don't wanna call her
I, I chooz u, baby
  (Oh, come on)
(Stay with me now, stay with me, sing it fo' me shawty)
I, I chooz u, baby
  ([Incomprehensible])
(Ah, come on, uh, uh, c'mon)
I, I chooz u, baby
  (Oh, come on)
(Stay with me now, stay with me, sing it fo' me shawty)
I, I chooz u, baby
  ([Incomprehensible])
(Ah, come on, uh, uh, c'mon)
