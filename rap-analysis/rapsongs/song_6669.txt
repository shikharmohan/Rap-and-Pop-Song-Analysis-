What's crack-a-lackin', baby girl?
You know I keep it ghetto fabulous everyday
Yep, in a real way, hey, hey, hey
Look, now what would a girl like you do wit a G like me
You probably couldn't handle it
I'll pop a bottle and get a few candles lit
Now the scene is set as we sip on some Moet, ya, ya
Rock your Tims, sag your jeans
Ice your grill, it's all good wit me
24's [Incomprehensible] doors
Ain't no doubt, I'm down to roll
I
(Love it)
The way you talk to me
  (Love it)
And your walk gets me
  (Love it)
You know how I like it, boy
Ghetto, so ghetto
That's how my baby rolls
And that's how we really know
That's ghetto, so ghetto
That's where my baby from
And that's how we gettin' it done
So ghetto
Hit your block, check your spot
If the block is hot, lay up in the spot, baby
Roll your dice, get your cash
I'ma down, shawty, you ain't gotta ask
I
(Love it)
'Cause you keep it ghetto
  (Love it)
Let me be your lover
  (Love it)
Baby, all I want is that
Ghetto, so ghetto
That's how my baby rolls
And that's how we really know
That's ghetto, so ghetto
That's where my baby from
And that's how we be gettin' it done
So ghetto
Ghetto love and I shoot it like cupid
Snoopin' wit Snoopy, we can get a little stupid
Kelly, Kelly, won't you tell me how you feelin' now?
You in the Phantom top dippin' wit the criminal
Yeah, so G I be
Mysterious, an' furious, an' curiously
So serious, injuriously, luxuriously
Ghetto, ghetto fabulous Snoop D O double G
I
(Love it)
'Cause you keep it ghetto
  (Love it)
Let me be your lover
  (Love it)
Baby, all I want is that
Ghetto, so ghetto

And that's how we really know
That's ghetto, so ghetto
That's where my baby from
And that's how we be getting' it done
