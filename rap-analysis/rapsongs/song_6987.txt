As I submit the new world grows in
Six, I cover myself with lamb skin
Black family, fine point to win
That again, prophecy watch the magic, can you?
Must begin to think, sit up
And you can see par 22 was lit up with the skull and bone
Betchya what is known of the scroll and key
Of the D.O.C.
Yeah, yeah, I have a secret plan
New world connects and threatens man
Other hand, everyone fake God light, neofight, spit
On the cross from a pit
And I look and I behold a pale horse
Forty second degree, mind in the source
Original, it's from the brotherhood
In the beginning, yet you never could
Listen ain't that kept undercover
Another one 'cause I got
Six got hung by the beast
Looking for the golden feet
With shackles lookin' to jackals
Greenpeace to a ring to fill
Death come quicker
When you shoot to kill
Watch out, but your merry, sleep with your gun
Show me the sign innocent one
The end might come
Now whatchya gonna do
Night, be to cold
Who shall save the human race, none
Six thousand, erase
Replace
Replace, replace
Replace, replace
Replace, replace
Replace
Here in by now, was so organized
Look for brotherhood
Made light the skies
Symbol of who arrives
Four thousand years the past remember
Religion is better to control your ass
Reflect when the millennium connect
It's so def freakin' right to meant to be elect
Reflect come face the order
Witness the immatical manslaughter
Now follow the master, supreme degree
The new world curve, now jet the 33
Thirteen levels above thee I see
Heel never to reveal the real keys
To the esoteric language
As you enter a brand new age of anguish
Pyramid police turn my niggaz into thieves no matter
Six thousand delete, repeat
Momma I don't want to die
Mind crawl circle complete
When they creep the cat claw alien
Secret unto the ages
Be symbolic to the dead sea pages
Nights history didn't
We forgettin' from where the cocaine
Brotherhood of the insane
Slay humanity you can not identify thyself
I sign and pray
Sign, hand over forehead
Countersign pyramid, eagle wing spread,hey
Luciferian, totalitarian, socialistic, twistic mind
So when they bail
Holy blood, holy grail
Historically, they don't want a nigga to see
Trilateral begun kurk
Political murdering, do the gun work
Chasin' to replace the hell
Into a jail cell
Society, don't want you in they clientel
No matter, six thousand we blood runnin'
'95's the beginning, watch out it's comin'
America is now under martial law
Stay in your home
Do not attempt contact with loved ones
Insurance agents, or attorneys
Do not attempt to think
Or depression may occur
Stay in your homes
Curfew is at 7 p.m. sharp, after work
Anyone caught outside the gates of their
Subdivision sectors after curfew
Will be shot
Remain calm, do not panic
Your neighborhood watch officer will be by
To collect urine samples in the morning
Anyone caught interfering with the collection
Of urine samples will be shot
Stay in your homes, remain calm
The number one enemy of progress is question
National security is more important than individual will
All sports broadcasts will proceed as normal
No more than two people may gather anywhere without permission
Use only the drugs prescribed by your boss or supervisor
Be happy, obey all orders without question
Be happy, at last, everything is done for you
