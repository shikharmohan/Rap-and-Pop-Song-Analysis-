The block is hot, the cops is swarmin' a neighborhood heavy
While niggas off in the neighborhood sellin'
With penitentiary chances the dope roped up in the cup of their pants
Fiends flock like come get this candy
I got heroin in bundles, them Highland O's
Plus a cooked slab, chopped up, dimes is swoll
If I spot the laws comin', hey it's time to roll
Candy Carter got a line of parole, outta control
The first fell a Tuesday this month oh sweet thang
Plus it's a sweet day, me next score for three days
One time they say what you mean, I gets the green
Break up the block like Maurice Green, ya feel me?
In my predicament, I'm guilty until proven' innocent
Hustle ridiculous, I'm tryin' to get this dope continuos
Ball 'til I fall, one thing, I ain't tryin' to fall
Want everybody numb like ambasol but he heard
There go them fuckin' po-po's
And if you know like I know
You better get off the corner
I'm a young dog, wild and ecstatic, violent when passin'
Hem gangstas doin' time in a parishment, role models
And keep ya cup, we drink whole bottles and cuss at niggas
Like fuck that nigga, I let my pump subtract niggas
You beef with me, I guarantee your mams be missin'
With a note behind demandin' three chickens or she gets it
Do not twist because lil' man is trippin'
They could have ya body in three different places
Ain't nothin' gravy, but save it
'Cause I'm a ride and hit the nigga street
Weezy go to war like Sadaam and Clinton disagree
While I'm shitty from the weed like were them bustas be
I promise ya never fuckin' sleep, I clear the set
Come outside late at night to your surprise I'm here with Tecks
Two shots knock off the niggas necks, it's so realistic
So I hope ya get it, or else them shots poke ya fetti
Be on the block until them souljas hit it that's when he heard
Blocka, me come to tear your block up
If you don't want no problems
You better get off the corner
All right, I cook it, cut it, ship and move it
I make a livin' in this crooked public distributin'
Just take a peek around the hood is floodin', shit is boomin'
The hottest D in town lookin' for me hit me Tuesday, like after six
See I crack the bricks right down to Z's
Got pounds of trees, my blocks blazin' QP's to KI's
Gangin' in the cheese, them bricks is comin'
No droughts, I don't sit on nothin'
I don't believe, I'm frontin' if I give you a dime, I leave with somethin'
The big dog, Nigga, I got the city under siege
And the law don't bother me, I give the pigs a couple of G's
Shit, I hustle strong to push this work through the streets
I'm tryin' to deal with every nigga and sell the birds up cheap
I'm greedy, if there's any money bein' made from drugs, I need it
Twenty bricks two weeks completed, you can't beat it
Whatever you want, holla at me when you need to get it
Does anybody else, I'll pay 'em a visit that's when ya heard
Come here peeps
I'm hearin' that you run these streets
You don't want beef
Then get off the corner
There go them fuckin' po-po's
And if you know like I know
You better get off the corner
There go them fuckin' po-po's
And if you know like I know
You better get off the corner
