Yo! Yo Joint Inf' did this
This right here is crazy
I-I feel big! You-know what I
Not, not big in the sense of weight, you know what I mean
Like gaining weight or, nothing like that
Like colossal, like you know what I mean? Like, ahh
I heard you were looking for me
(Hey Mr. Carter)
Hello!
(Tell me where have you been?)
Ha ha ha, you know! Ha ha ha
  (They been asking, they been searching, they been wondering why)
Yeah, ha ha, ha I know! Ha ha
(Hey Mr. Carter)
Hey, Hello!
(Tell me where have you been?)
Shit, you know! Ha ha ha
(They been asking, they been searching, they been wondering why)
Ha ha ha!
Yeah, to you, forever, from me to you
I heard somebody say church, I'ma need a suit
I'ma need a coupe, I won't need a roof
Flyer than Beetle juice, Beetle juice, be-the-juice
I got the floor, I'm tryna see the roof
Didn't wear a bulletproof
So I got shot and you can see the Proof
Blind eyes colored guide me and see the truth
Wonder if Stevie do?
But I'ma leave it to God, not Beaver, neither you
'Cause I'ma murder, why I kill ol' and even you?
Man, I got Summer hating on me 'cause I'm hotter than the sun
Got Spring hating on me 'cause I ain't never sprung
Winter hating on me 'cause I'm colder than ya'll
And I would never, I would never, I would never Fall
I'm being hated by the seasons
So fuck ya'll who hating for no reason!
(Hey Mr. Carter)
I am him!
(Tell me where have you been?)
Around the world and I'm back again!
  (They been asking, they been searching, they been wondering why)
Who's been asking about me? In case you're wondering
Haa!
(Hey Mr. Carter)
I am him!
(Tell me where have you been?)
Around the world and now I'm back again!
  (They been asking, they been searching, they been wondering why)
Who's been asking about me? In case you're wondering
Haa!
Yeah, I been in and out the bank, bitch!
While all ya'll asshole niggas been on the same shit, I flush
And watch it go down the drain quick
Two words you will never hear, "Wayne Quit"
'Cause Wayne win, and they lose
I call them April Babies, 'cause they Fools
And when they snooze, we up
Feet up, like a paraplegia
Or paraplegic, I parallel park
In a red and yellow thang, old school Atlanta Hawk
Like I'm from Collipark, but I'm from Hollygrove!
Now all my Bloods scream, "Soup," "Woo,"and "Da da dooh!"
I know my role and I play it well
And I wear it well on my Libra Scale
I suck a pussy, fuck a pussy, leave it there
Long hair don't even care
Young!
(Hey Mr. Carter)
I am him!
(Tell me where have you been?)
Around the world and now I'm back again!
  (They been asking, they been searching, they been wondering why)
Who's been asking about me? In case you're wondering
(Hey Mr. Carter)
I am him!
(Tell me where have you been?)
Around the world and now I'm back again!
  (They been asking, they been searching, they been wondering why)
Who's been asking about me? In case you're wondering
Cheah! I'm right cheah, in my chair, with my crown and my dear
Queen Bee, as I share mic time with my heir
Young Carter, go farther, go further, go harder
Is that not why we came? And if not, then why bother?
Show no mercy in Murcielago's
I'm far from being the bastard that Marcy had fathered
Now my name's being mentioned with the martyrs
The Biggie's and the Pac's and the Marley's and the Marcuses
Garvey, got me a Molotov Cocktail
Flow even if you box well can't stop the blows
Kaboom, the Roc Boy in the room
The dope boy just came off the spoon
Also, I'm so fly I'm on auto
Pilot, while guys just stare at my wardrobe
I see Euro's, that's right, plural
I took so much change from this rap game, it's your go
(Hey Mr. Carter)
Young!
It's my go
Yeah, and I'ma go so opposite of soft
Off the Richter, Hector Camacho, man, Randy Savage
Far from average, above status quo
Flow, so, pro
I know, I rise slow
And when I pass
They say, "What up, killer man?"
Stop bringing up my past!
And next time you mention Pac, Biggie, and Jay-Z
Don't forget Weezy baby!
(Hey Mr. Carter)
Ay man
(Tell me where have you been?)
Yo!
(They been asking, they been searching, they been wondering why)
Ha ha ha
(Hey Mr. Carter)
Ay Man
(Tell me where have you been?)
Hova!
  (They been asking, they been searching, they been wondering why)
Weezy! Baby
(Hey Mr. Carter)
Ha ha ha
(Tell me where have you been?)
I been hustling
  (They been asking, they been searching, they been wondering why)
Hustling hard, cheah!
(Hey Mr. Carter)
And I swear to everything, when I leave this Earth
(Tell me where have you been?)
It's gonna be on both feet, never knees in the dirt
  (They been asking, they been searching they been wondering why)
You can try me fucka, but when I squeeze it hurts
Fine, we lose two lives, yours and mines
Gimme any amount of time, don't let Mrs. Carter grieve
At the funeral parlor, dripping tears down my sleeve
Gimme any amount of time, don't let Mrs. Carter grieve
