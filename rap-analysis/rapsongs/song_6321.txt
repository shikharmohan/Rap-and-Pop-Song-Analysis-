You want me to say it now?
C'mon let's go
All you cats in the back if you ain't wack
If you're on the side fly girls and guys
All the people in the middle when Spin drops the needle
If there's moneymakers in the front you know what I want
I went to a party the other day around the way
With my partner her name P E P A
We were dressed to kill ready and willin' to make a killin'
Met Spinderella at the door, what was she doin' Salt? Chillin'
We walked inside a man asked the three for ID
When he found out who we was he said
"Go ahead girls, y'all can go in free
The drinks are on the house, anything you want is yours"
Then he gave us the keys to the V.I.P. doors
I said
"Hey, you, I like it like that!"
Hey, you, I like it like this
If I had a wish before I die
I'd like to have it like this for the rest of my life
Chillin' at the bar drinking Moet and caviar
People pointin' at us 'cause they know who we are
Word had gotten around that S-N-P was in the place
Now they gathered around to get a little taste
"Yo, please, baby, please, I wanna hear you MC"
Is what this guy and his friend had said to Pepa and me
Although we tried to resist, but then I said, "Hey, what's the use?
One song won't hurt, and besides, his friend is cute"
Spindy got on a set, handed a mic to me and Pep
Then we started to rhyme, and I'm sure you know the rest
They said
"Hey, you, I like it like that!"
Hey, you, I like it like this
If I had a wish before I die
I'd like to have it like this for the rest of my life
It feels good when people are on it, don't it? You know it does
Being treated like a queen on any scene just like we was
Call it juice, call it jocks, whatever it is I know it rocks
Till you sweat me and expect me to like it a lot
And say
"Hey, you, I like it like that!"
Hey, you, I like it like this
If I had a wish before I die
I'd like to have it like this for the rest of my life
Yo, what are you doin'?
Put the beat back on
C'mon, stop playin' around Hurb
Yeah, boy, you know you know we need some (bass!)
Yeah, it's chill now
It's ok, now let it play so we can say
"Hey, you, I like it like that!"
Hey, you, I like it like this
If I had a wish before I die
I'd like to have it like this for the rest of my life
