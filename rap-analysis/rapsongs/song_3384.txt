Charlie Wilson - Chorus)
I know you see me now right now,
(I know you see me now right now)
I know you see me now right now (Right now, right now)

(Beyonce - Hook)
I got my suit and tie and i dont know if yall know
Well maybe yall do or maybe yall dont
But i dont really care (yeah) 
cus how we on it all the time (uh)
So imma get my money lets go
(Kanye - Verse 1)
Now imma need you to kill the hypocrisy, this an aristocracy
Im Socrates but my skin more chocolaty
''Whats up wooo?'' Thats old news
Im in a speed boat, in my boat shoes
Ha?
I swear my whole collection so cruise
I might walk in nobu, with no shoes
He just walked in nobu like it was wholefoods
That nigger crazy i told you
Immatue adult insecure asshole (What else)
If you fall on the concrete thats your asphalt
If you pass on that Kane beat, thats your last thought
Get what you ask for i swear thats your ass thought
She got a big booty but she couldnt drop that ass low
So you take your last hoe and rope up all the cash flow
When you getting money they be all up on your ass yo
When you getting money cuts dont matter cus a nigger past go
Straight to jail yo, in a hell hole
Right next to lucifer, tell him i said hello
Ask if imma be there soon, and tell him i said hell no.
Yo what you say when your people get out of jail huh?
(Beyonce)
My niggers is home, i guess i got everything
Everything i want, but i dont
Know matter how good it gets it will never be like before
No women in the crowd, screaming and its loud
Doing things not allowed
And i swear its going down right now
I know one thing my momma would be proud
And you see me looking up
Cus i know shes looking down right now
(Charlie Wilson - Chorus)
I know you see me now right now,
(I know you see me now right now)
I know you see me now right now (Right now, right now)
I know you see me now right now (Right now)
I know you see me now right now
(Kanye - Verse 2)
Poor the champagne let your watch show
Shortie got a man watch, wrist look colossal
I admit my first watch was a fossil
Now im in the louvre looking for fossils
Attention to detail is so uncanny
And the whips on this ????? is so uncamrie
Somebody needs to put us on camera
The world of rollies and everyones family
Stay jordan fresh suites and ferraris coupes
N shortie watch barneys? we head the barneys?
End up at 'mani giorgi and service from sergio pacini
lamborghini the chain blow off the vertigo
I know the flow just hit a hella-fied vertical
This the cris year, last year was magic 32
Lyricaly cant' none of yall murder Ye' 
Cus yall raps aint got no vertebrae
I got style ask julie she heard in may
I killt the fur last, Paris rasied the murder rate
FIrst of all we all know the beats is
Like a mix between fergie and jeez
Imagine the direction of this immaculate conception
Everyone of his majesty's swim partys is pageantrys
Cannon ball of the diving board when i am bored
All my hommies GD's but i am lord
Rap god, Greek mythology
and this life to crazy to think logicaly
Heres somthing that you can use an analogy
My life is like a childs solutions become reality
(Beyonce)
Now go get my throne cus i dont wanna stop
I just go in my zone and imma make it hot
Till its time to go when its time to go
Where you trying to go? you better act like you can see me know
(Charlie Wilson - Chorus)
I know you see me now right now,
(I know you see me now right now)
I know you see me now right now (Right now, right now)
I know you see me now right now (Right now)
I know you see me now right now
