This is how we do
We make a move and act a fool
While we up in the club
This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it
So show us some love
Fresh like, uhh, Impala, unnh
Crome hyrdolics, 808 drums
You don't want, none, nigga betta, run
When beef is on, I'll pop that, drum
Come get, some, pistol grip, pump
If a nigga steps on my white Air, Ones
Since red, rum, ready here I, come
Compton, unh, Dre found me in the, slums
Sellin' that skunk, one hand on my gun
I was sellin' rocks when Master P was sayin', "Unnh"
Buck pass tha blunt
These G-Unit girls just wanna have, fun
Coke and rum, got weed on the ton
I'm bangin' with my hand up her dress like, unh
I'll make her cum, purple haze in my lungs
Whole gang in the front in case a nigga pull a stunt
I put Lamborghini doors on that Es-co-lade
Low pro so look like I'm riding on blades
In one year mang, a nigga's so paid
I have a straight bitch in the telly goin' both ways
(Ah)
Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
I give it to ya just how you like it, girl
You know I'm rockin' with the best tre pound on my hip
Teflon on my chest, they say I'm no good 'cuz I'm so hood
Rich folks do not want me around
'Cuz shit might pop off and if shit pop off
Somebody gon' get laid the fuck out
They call me new money, say I have no class
I'm from the bottom, I came up too fast
The hell if I care, I'm just here to get my cash
Bougie ass bitches, you can kiss my ass
This is how we do
We make a move and act a fool
While we up in the club
This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it
So show us some love
I put gold Daytonas on that Cherry Six-Four
White walls so clean it's like I'm ridin' on bulbs
Hit one switch mang, that ass so low
Cali got niggaz in New York ridin' on hundred spokes
Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
I give it to ya just how you like it, girl
You know I'm rockin' with the best fo' pound on my hip
Gold chain on my chest
(Ah)
50, unh, Bentley, unh
'Em came 'n gotta nigga fresh out the, slum
Automatic, gun, fuck 'em one-on-one
We wrap up ya punk ass, stunt 'n ya done
Homie, it's Game time
You ready? Here I come
Call Lloyd Banks
And get this motherfucker, cunt
It took two, months but 50 got it done
Signed with G-unit
Had niggaz like, "Huh?"
Don't try to front
I'll leave yo' ass slumped
Thinkin' I'm a punk
Get your fuckin' head lumped
Fifty got a gun
Ready here he come, gotta sick, vendetta
To get this, chedda, meet my Ba, Retta
The drama, setta, sip Ama, retta
My flow sounds, betta than average
On tracks I'm a savage, I damage
Any nigga tryin' to front on my clique
(G-Unit)
