Now I'ma do this thing like it ain't done before
Never leave the game stranded, I had to give more
I'ma give you what you want, what you waitin' for?
Make the music that the people can't ignore
A lotta niggas is bitches, a lotta bitches be trippin'
A lotta them be wishin' that they was in my position
A lotta niggas be cowards and most chicks be chickens
Fuck 'bout the cluck! Cluck! Eve ain't trippin'
Most dudes is okay, half of the rest ain't
Talkin' 'bout what they wanna do, reality they can't
Ask 'em what they life worth, watch 'em draw a blank
I really ain't got no interest if it don't involve the bank
Most of the time I'm nice to 'em, half the time I'm not
It ain't nothin' new though learned it from off the block
People think I changed much 'cuz I'm livin' good
Now they get my voice mail, hear them callin' me rude
Sometimes I feel bad most of the time I don't
'Cuz if I don't protect my shit other niggas won't
Some want me to neglect my shit, take it for a joke?
But I'm stayin' on the grind, never goin' back to broke
Anything I want, I'ma get it 'cuz I know I need it
It's Evey comin' and I know you heated
Anything I need, gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it
Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction
Everything I am, just because I had to make it happen
They never thought that I would make it rappin'
Anything I need, gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it
Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction
Now I'ma do this thing like it ain't done before
Never leave the game stranded, I had to give more
I'ma give you what you want, what you waitin' for?
Make the music that the people can't ignore
See how we do this thing dog? Here we go again
Dre and Bombshell, don't you love how we blend?
Radio stations, DJ's they spin told y'all determined to win
You tryin' enter through the back door? Ain't nothin' happenin'
This whole shit is my shit bitch and I'm the captain
Can't beat me join me baby then get to clappin'
Bang it in ya whips to get ya neck snappin'
I know you hopin' that I rest so you can breathe
Stressed when we in the same places 'till I leave
Whisper to they friends what they wanna do to me
Wish they could erase me, take away the air I breathe
And I feed 'cuz that shit only give me hunger pains
Never let you muhfuckas put out my flame
Ready for whatever, was trained to maintain
And I always been a savage 'bout the fame
Separate the girls from the women and the winnin'
Always knew the thrill was worth it from the beginnin'
Baby what's the deal? I'm hurtin' 'em how I'm livin'
I gotta conquer it all now the world's my mission
Anything I want, I'ma get it 'cuz I know I need it
It's Evey comin' and I know you heated
Anything I need, gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it
Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction
Everything I am, just because I had to make it happen
They never thought that I would make it rappin'
Anything I need, gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it
Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction
Ain't nothin' hotter than this heat y'all, it's like a magnet
I don't really mess wit too many 'cuz they be plastic
That's it enjoy it boy, it's like magic
Anything less than a banger will not have it
Still I Ruff Ryde but I got my team
And we ain't goin' nowhere 'till we lock the game
But in the meantime ball while we live the dream
And now I need to hear y'all sing
Anything I want, I'ma get it 'cuz I know I need it
It's Evey comin' and I know you heated
Anything I need, gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it
Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction
Everything I am, just because I had to make it happen
They never thought that I would make it rappin'
Anything I need, gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it
Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction
Anything I want, I'ma get it 'cuz I know I need it
It's Evey comin' and I know you heated
Anything I need, gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it
Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction
Everything I am, just because I had to make it happen
They never thought that I would make it rappin'
Anything I need, gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it
Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction
