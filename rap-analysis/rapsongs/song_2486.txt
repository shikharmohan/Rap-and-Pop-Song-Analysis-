Here we go cruisin, me and my boys rollin four deep
In the a-u streets, seein who we can meet
Beep beep, a crew of girls in their green cherokee
Screamin, "that's erick g," my boys gettin happy b
Err, errr, the girls made a u-turn
Pulled up beside me, tires smellin burned (yea yea)
I scoped the whole car yo before I spoke
To see which one was dope before I start actin loc
That's crazy, "how you doin baby?  the one
With the daisies, short top with the paisleys
What's your name?  oh they call you lucky? "
Had child's play on my mind but none of us was chucky
"so what are you doin?  follow me to my crib"
I had the girls trailin, had my system wailin (boom boom)
Drove off, and my boys screamin loud
Happy for the hoes because they wasn't crows (word me up)
We argued, on who gets who
The first pick is mine, respect from my crew
I took the freaky deaky one who was drivin
She looked like she was widdit, I definitely want to hit it
(word em up) jeff screamed, "we're goin out for the cause
And when we get there, we're goin straight for the drawers"
Dude - they was bangin, I must try not to keep them hangin
Yeah - but I find myself singin

On the way home, damn I almost crashed with my friends
Four girls in two drop-top bm's
Man it must be a dream, I must be on the wrong planet
Four girls, lookin like janet (yea yea)
+that's the way love goes+ when you're clockin hoes
Nobody knows, but my face expression shows (yea yea)
I was wide open, man I couldn't believe it
If the girl asked me for my truck, I swear she can keep it
(word em up) on the pharcyde, the girls +passed me by+
The ones who was trailin me, goin in the cherokee
But fuck em, I didn't care anymore
Cause these girls was the flyest bitches I ever saw
(word em up) so me and my boys approached to the cars
Stepped out to the females, lookin like some stars (word em up yo)
Hi, my name is erick, whassup, how y'all doin? 
Just coolin like levert in y'all tennis skirts (word em up)
How bout y'all comin to my crib and take a swim
And maybe darken up the skins (yeah)
Are you widdit?  c'mon, follow me to hook up my friends
With your friends, then we all can be friends, word - yeah
Go on the way, I'm jumpin on the highway
Mad traffic and shit, because it was a friday
I check my rearview, lookin right behind me
Girls in the bm, lookin kinda fine see
My mind playin tricks on me already
Someone turned off the lights, yo it musta been teddy
Oh somebody tell me what's happenin
I'm caught up, this ain't the way me and my boys was brought up
(word em up) maybe I'm gettin excited - not
There's no doubt in my mind that that girl is hot
Yeah - and matter of fact, she got the blazin looks
Make me wanna sing this hook
Peace to my man brent
