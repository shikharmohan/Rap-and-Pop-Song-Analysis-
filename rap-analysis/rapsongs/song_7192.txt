Chinchilla to the floor, Cigarillo full of dro
White Benz double doors, I could change colors though
Blue Ferrari, red Bent, black truck on 24's
Several Chevrolet's on 20 inches maybe more
Used to wish for better days, now I'm wishin' never more
I could go buy anything, stick my dick in every hoe
Grand Hustle on everything, P$C in every store
Sellin' everything from rubber bands to leather coats
Swear to God I never change, jealous niggaz never know
T.I.P. ain't never been a lame, jigalow since '84
Blessed with astonishing ability to pull a hoe
Fuck her so, good make her think this dick was full of Moe
Pussy so, good but I love it when she suck it slow
(Oh)
Her motto, you don't swallow what you suckin' for
(Oh)
My motto you ain't ballin' what you hustle for
The VVS's let off such a glow to let these bustas know
Hey! Hey! Hey shawty bounce like this just bounce

Just bend it over and make it bounce like this
I give you 30 seconds show me what you got, could you?
Bend it over for me drop it like it's hot, could you?
Wiggle your titties a little lift your top get you to
Bust it open show your panties and your ass for me
Actually I was thinking you, Kim and Daphine
In the back with me, lickin' on the bottom half of me
Answer me first know that sayin' no is blaspheme
Me, I'm pussy pumper, number one you can ask for me
I knew how you danced for me that you had plans for me
Save the conversation get your partner out them pants for me
Damn honey, you'd be a fool if you ran from me
You ain't fuckin' wit another dummy I'm the man honey
I'm tryin' to give it to you 'till it make you stand funny
(Oh)
Throw that pussy right and maybe you can get a grand from me
(Oh, ha)

Not a one thin dime but your ass is fine

Hey shawty, stall if you want to, I ball when I want to
Could fall through and shut down the mall if I want to
I could make your girlfriend choose but I want you
Why you bother me with what you will and you won't do?
Listen shawty, I'm a grown man and you grown too
You can leave with me, I ain't gotta telephone you
All I'm thinking 'bout is me layin' on you
Or vice versa with a lot of ass to hold on to
I got somethin' for that ass to bounce onto
You missin' the chance of a lifetime, why don't you?
Hop off in the drop top, ride through the city lights
Take you where I kick it, let you see what pimpin' living like
Pop one of these then we'll see what you feeling like
Takin' off your clothes, wanna know what it's drilling like
Presidential suite at the very end of the night
Treat you like a freak and give you what was missing in your life
Hey! Hey! Hey shawty bounce like this just bounce
Let me see you bounce like this
Hey! Hey! Hey shawty bounce like this just bounce
Tell that bitch to bounce like this
Hey! Hey! Hey shawty bounce like this just bounce
All my nigga bounce like this

Let me see you let me bounce with me, bounce with me
