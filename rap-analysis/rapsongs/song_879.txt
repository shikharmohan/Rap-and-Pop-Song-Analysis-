[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes] 
You got a hotter other than my Copacabana, mama 
Gotta lotta S--t with you when I'm loving persona mama 
Always love to get with you whenever 
u need me, mama holla 
How you check me, can you give me the oochie walla walla 
Swallow a couple shots of Jag and make a dolla 
Lil' mama in the crib with a poke to complete your scalla 
Talk about an example of a shorty that might need to prowla 
Got a chick in the bug, it come with a little shoppahora 
Take you to the Caribbean down the Carolina 
To the Mediterranean and enjoy the water 
When the role is wacky, you keepin' me stocky 
Takin' care of this super Mike 
When you check on your Papi 
When you're right baby, hug me with all your might 
And put it on, cause you know it's on tonight 
Break up or make up, you know we I'm gone 
when you find an empty ride 
we will be together and still be bright
