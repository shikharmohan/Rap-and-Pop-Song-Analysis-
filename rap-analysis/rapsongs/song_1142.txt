Yo yo check it 
Unattached and calm sundaes and pills I palm 
with intentions to make it to the league 
Intrigued by two letter cars SE's and GS'ses 
On the court niggaz I leave like messages 
Plagued by this ball player exorcist 
It's sort of foul how the world be reffin us 
Kenny is our Moses in this five on five Exodus 
For the game of life full courts ain't preppin us 
Schools want me but the ghost of Manigault haunts me 
Plus they wanna crib me, way out in the country 
I'm city like street lights and some games that be fights 
Never worked on my left so it's hard to be right 
Either rich poor or Mike is who I wanna be like 
Story of many black males that I refuse to rewrite 
Yo, brothers opinions is Bias-ed, like Len 
that I'll end up like Ben, Wilson, still some pretend to be friends 
Beneath the grin I see the ?gin spoke up and assure a? 
More so than my soul, my jump shot is purer 
People play juror, I witness the fall of legends 
Once was the joint now they restin got a God given present 
My gallant talent is like a magic 
trick turned by a chick with a bad habit 
Opportunity to move I grab it 
Me and my moms have static, now I wreak Hennesey and havoc 
Man to man talks with Kenny, send me to a zone 
Been on my own for so long, my vocal tone's grown 
Competition gets blown like speakers 
when I cross her like Jesus out of bleachers, broads and beepers 
Yeah I boogey it's all good, but it could be better 
Want to stay eighteen forever 
But now I stay on point like Rod in this Strickland 
If Brooklyn courts was the canvas, then I would be the big man 
From thoughts that pennies bring, I assemble teams like the Kenny Kings 
Think fast over breaks, dialect I'm dribbling 
Remembering, night posters of Moses and the Supreme Court 
Realizing, that rap and life are team sports 
I follow deep thoughts 
Moves never perceived thought lyrical Johnny Cochran 
cause of the way I free thought 
The system make a nigga think to make it that he need sports 
or either to the tip he gotta resort 
my seed'll be taught to start his own 
In the, George Carter zone 
Don't wanna be a dope MC living in his momma's home 
Or speaking to my fans in a starving artist tone 
Unknown zones I roam with mind architechter 
Spark the lecture, emphasizing to let God direct ya
