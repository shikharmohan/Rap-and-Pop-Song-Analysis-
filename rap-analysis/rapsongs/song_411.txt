[Chorus]
[Krayzie Bone & Wish Bone]:
I been so many places (all around the world)
So many unfamiliar faces
Oh I pray everyday (everyday)
To keep from going crazy
I been so many places (all around the world)
So many unfamiliar faces
Oh I pray everyday (everyday)
To keep from going crazy
[Krayzie Bone]
well whut do you kno

but were still strugling
tryna come up on tha ?? with the dollar
do the dam thing n i got to maintain
try not to go insane

im facing complications
motions happenin in tha game
temptations of the ??
shaking a grey??
im keepin my eye on yal
gon let nobody hold me back
i never thought that livin ma life coul be this real
never done figured that being a rapper would be so hard

as soon as i open my eyes

i realize i gota die
and life dont last forever
and fast living make ya crazy
if ya suck up too much trust me

[Chorus]
[Wish Bone]
the hustle goin through this world
im not really doin it for fun

and maybe we can chill out
hit up a couple of your spots
have some drinks and pass out
if not bye bye
Cuz I got another show
Sometimes you never know

and then we go??
and then its on the next city thugs
changin all ?? one

and i know you feel me
Thats why you gota get your hustle awwnnn
Everybody get the money

[Chorus]
[Layzie Bone]
now i done traveled around the globe
and there some things that i ?? seen
me n ma team chasin green
running this earth tryna live our dreams
but i seen it make the average person run quik n hide
and u kno im down for the ride
i hada ch??
and swallow my pride
i hate to admit it but dog
i live off material things is what i was after
who would have thought by being a rapper
all the cultures?? i capture
i got caught up in the rapture
assumed it was written
?? women
poppin this trigger
think the whole world think of us trippin
i dont know why and i dont know what it is
all them crazy things i don did
brought me closer to my kids
no more dwellin?? by my lonely
long story but im thorough
me an ma dogs runnin this planet
its just us against the world
(come on)
[Chorus]
[Bizzy Bone]
yea niggas don really know me
not one of ma homies
wana control me
control these nuts or go home??
wana hold me
think one of tha twins they coming for me
Hallelujah
only one sacred and holy
phony love how they givin it only
one of them thick black
club
tha LAPD whooping on him
the bitch was strippin down in San Diego
she only in it for the money
but we all in it for something tho
and she really loved Tony
some thick dick yellow nigga
he lived in the basement
and he sell weed to the drug dealers
run around the hood n now youre mother fukin high??
rather die than to be caught up in deceptions and lies
word to the wise
[Chorus]
