Get get get 'em
My block pumpin and i'm tryin to keep that hoe pumpin
If niggaz snitchin them i let them niggaz hold sumthin
If a nigga owe sumthin need a doctors note from 'em
Or his throat from 'em
These lil niggaz thinkin they fresh, get whipped out ya clothes youngin
I got it all but i'll beat you like you stole sumthin

Yall bitch niggaz kno me i'm a rider in the side of the south
Got the money in the matress and the guns in the couch

Puttin out cockroaches in the ashtray

Walkin that line with alot on my mind
I get that money, never droppin a dime
I don't hate, never, not on my time
I'll put that little red dot on ya mind
Talkin that crime but alot of 'em lyin
Im caught on the grind, never get off my grind
Ima pimp to these hoes, not a pimp in my mind, nah
And everybody kno i'm sharp when i ride
Hop out that new ferrari with that little horse on the side yea
Zoom zoom bitch ride a nigga broom witch
Have a key wet stinkin up your whole room bitch
Now break out the perfume bitch
And niggaz come from out that beach, i'm in that water like a cruise ship
Straight up, tell all my dudes this
1 pistol, 2 clips, i aim at lips
Wayne that shit, shit on y'all
Given to you from the guard
I am the guard
Yeaa, money on my mind, money money on my mental
Super super soaker wet a nigga like a swim suit
I think they sippin on that 'i can fuck with him juice'
Test me if ya wanna bad man i knock a limb loose
I ain't never scared, i'm protected everywhere
And if a nigga disrespect me then he shall be very dead
Thats my word, gotta urge to hit a nigga and swerve
And them birds in the trigger shot down to my feet
Its me bitch nigga whats better to see
And when ya greeted like me ain't nothin better then beef
See i would meet each one of you niggaz in the street
Then eat - and pick you little nigga out my teeth
Shout out to the green and red stiches in my teeth nigga
With no gucci i'm a double chief nigga
My brothers you have send, and the guard i am..
Amen..
