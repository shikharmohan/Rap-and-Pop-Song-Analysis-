I'm holding on your rope, 
Got me ten feet off the ground 
I'm hearin what you say but I just can't make a sound 
You tell me that you need me 
Then you go and cut me down, but wait 
You tell me that you're sorry 
Didn't think I'd turn around, and say... 
[Lil' Wayne:]
Ok I'm talking bout a
Good girl gone bad
Crooked world wrong pad 
Right mom wrong dad 
I sing this song mad but not mad enough to shoot you
But it just eats me up like some bbq from Luther's
In the morning with the roosters 
On the corner with the boosters
And she's the freshcut and they're on her like sutures
And I wanna talk to her
But her momma has to school her
I wanna see her better
She's the weather of my future
I don't wanna see another hurricane 
Baby you can kill the pain 
If you just let me explain
Trust me I know what I'm sayin'
You will end up on the track of an oncoming train
Stuck in the passenger seat
Tryna do the fast lane

Well once upon a time there was a mom and a dad
Who on the outside had everything people wished they had
A beautiful daughter two story house two car garage
And a white picket fence wrapped around the front yard
See daddy was a doctor
And mommy was a banker
Mommy's job got outsourced
So now mommy's drinker
Daddy had a malpractice suit
Now he's a snorter
And all this shits takin place 
right in front of their daughter
She says, "Daddy what's wrong?" 
But he's just too high
"Mommy what we gon' do?"
She just get drunk and cry
Caught in the middle of two wrongs trying to do right
Looking for answers all alone in the darkness of night
They say

Yeah it's too hard to apologize
It's too hard
I said it's too hard to apologize
It's too hard
