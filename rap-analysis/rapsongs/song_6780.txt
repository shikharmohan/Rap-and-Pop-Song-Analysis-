Ya got to get bout it or without it
I had to shake the spot 'cause the game got crowded
I'm devoted and quote it, I'm rowdy and bout it
A No Limit Soldier and happy to shout it
Got this tank on my neck, got my tech on deck
I slap raps at your caps and try to make my snaps
Knick knack patty wack, big happy sack, the dealer is back
And I'm riding through your neighborhood dipping in my Cadillac
I'm selling this shit, I ain't telling this shit
I'm a muthafucking two time felon, ya bitch
From the cold hearted streets of the LBC
To a mansion in the south, down the street from my nigga, P
See, real niggas recognize the realness
Put ya muthafucking choppers up if ya feel this
(Bust one)
Now bust one, not just one
And if ya want some get some, I bet we got some
Bustas discuss us, niggas popping all the Ying Yang
Still the Dogg Pound Gang

Beats still funky, beats by the Pound in the house
At the muthafucking door

While I fuck with these out of town hoes, blowing all they weed
(Shut up)
Parlaying, so whatcha saying?
Bring a couple buddies witcha, girl, we ain't playing
Baby, must misread me 'cause she mislead me
Has some niggas come by later and try to spray me
(What? Bitch)
But I'm just to quick, slick and sly
When it's time to ride, I let the bullets fly 'cause it's do or die
(Die, die)
I wear blue 7 days out the week
(For life)
I mob the street, DP, while I'm holding my heat
I wanna warn you, shit, they got killers on the East
Midwest, up north, down south in California
So if you got your chrome, you need to stay in the zone
And get a vest for your muthafucking dome
'Cause it's on like a dog with out his bone
I'm in it to win it and No Limit is my home
(For life, for life)
Nigga, real niggas recognize the realness
Put ya muthafucking choppers up if ya feel this
