Every dog has his day
Another thirty nine inch thick classic
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl, as I sit here thinking to myself
There is no one for you but me and I mean that
And I think about all the things we've been through
Like arguing and fighting for example
You know the love we have for each other
It tends to out weigh what do to one another
Ya know my grand-daddy use to always say
Ya know he used to say it like this
There will be, ups and downs, smiles and frowns
Share with me, fairy tales or make believe
There will be, ups and downs, smiles and frowns
Share with me, fairy tales or make believe

What up motherfuckers? This is Snoop Dogg
I'm trying to figure out how the fuck I'm gonna do y'all
Hanging with my homie from the turf, that's Young Q-ball
Giving me the word on the street, here's the scoop y'all
The niggaz from the Eastside split up
And one of 'em tried to fuck yo' shit up
Now 'cuz, don't believe that, that's my nigga for life
I'm out with the bullshit, I'm in with the real shit
I'm at the church doing work, spittin' game from the pulpit
And ask forbidness and God is my witness
L B C 2 1 3 hell yeah, we in this
It's so relentless, and all my dogs up against the life sentence
I love y'all, like I love no bitch, and that's real shit
Or some crip shit, homie dig this

I used to have a lot of broads that I don't fool with
I used to have a lot of homeboys I ain't cool with
A lot people that a nigga went to go to school with
Happy as hell to see the Big Dog doin' it
But what none of them would believe though
That I would be bigger the Kurtis Blow
I guess he was right, these are the breaks
Despite my mistakes and aches, I'm gettin' cake
To realize your fate through faith
'Cause we all gonna get that day
To see if our lives was straight
And to see if we gonna walk through those Pearly Gates
To see the man upstairs, on some real talk homie
I'm tired of being stuck here
If I could I would fly to the moon
Y'all probably think I'm trippin' off these mushrooms

Now as I think back to the words my grand-daddy used to say
I never seen him in church, but he always had The Word
He always would tell me
Sometimes you gotta take the good with the bad
You gotta do bad in order to do good
