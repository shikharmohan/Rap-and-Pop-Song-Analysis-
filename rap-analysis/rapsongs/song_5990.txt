The queen is hyped up, the queen is hyped up
The queen is hyped up, the queen is hyped up
Ayo Manda, what's up La
Yo people have been trying to get fierce on me
I think it's time I tell them about themselves
Yo, just give it to them safari style
Well, well, well it's L A, the T I, the F A H, you'll see why
Q U double E N is the reason I must be myself
What else? Well, fame hasn't got me
Souped up, selling out, sloppy or poppy
There so much live for, there for here's more from a woman
All woman keep the rumors to yourself
The over blown, home grown, not known
Fools who never shown proof let alone own
A lot of props or hip hip pop chart
Notch on your clock is my spot
Now who got the marks? I do
Why you little played out a chew, bless you
I'm allergic to wack crews, the La, the ti, the fah
The queen is up, throwing salt that you never seen before
How dare those who talk we can't have them
Some make me wanna go out with the bat and a magnum
But a wise, civilized and growing higher
Judgments from the Queen punish is the fire
I here to make these fools out of liars
You must learn step and respect the sire face the fire
Latifah had it up to here the frauds felling fear, fear
The sound is playing like a Q-tip digging your ear, ear
Mama Zula stands for positivity, knowledge and grace
I never run my piece, damn, I'll take it to your face
Open why you hoping none stutter, stop 'em
Maybe choke, choke because it's very hard to breathe
While La got you in a yolk, I'll cut your throat, I'll cut it short
No one ever getting near Latifah's had it up to here
Give it to 'em Queen, yeah, yeah, yeah
Give it to 'em Queen, I got it
Give it to 'em Queen, yeah, yeah, yeah
Give it to 'em Queen, I got it
Give it to 'em Queen, yeah, yeah, yeah
Give it to 'em Queen, I got it
Give it to em Queen, yeah, yeah, yeah
The Queen L A T I F A H in command
Some of these commercial entertainers
Are commercially a pain to my mind and my behind
Try to dis Dana, bumping me off
Because the Queen has reached a certain plateau
All I do is boo and say,  'Is that so?'
Talk is cheap and if talk got any cheaper
They'll be selling Nike tongues instead of sneakers
Kay sa rah sa rah, blazay blah, etcetera
This is a scene from the Queen La, La
Lovely and lyrically loose but lady like
I'm too slick to slip up or get tricked by the shady type
Chomps y'all talk and still wonder how loose I got
When I'm in town I give the boosters booster shots
Breaks breaks, face face, never never, waste waste
Your mind on a rhyme
That will get thrown in your fronting face
I'll cut your throat, I'll cut it short
No one ever getting near Latifah's had it up to here
Give it to 'em Queen, who got it?
Give it to 'em Queen Latifah
Give it to 'em Queen, who got it?
Give it to 'em Queen Latifah
Give it to 'em Queen, who got it?
Give it to 'em Queen Latifah
Give it to 'em Queen, who got it?
Queen L A T I F A H in command
Royal and loyal, face the fire, boy
You wouldn't get the time of the day
So make way, hey, silence I say
Lay low and have a cold one
Cause the whipping I'm dishing is an old one
I through some soul into my morning bowl then I rolled
I took your gold and stopped your singled
'Cause it ever never sold
Matter of fact it never even got the time to sprout
So you could never give me body or come in my house
The flavor unit is doing back again this year
How many flavors of the flavor can you love to hear
Feel the force of my holocaust, I'm staring at ya
Put in a bid on who will fall, I'm sure to match ya
Snatch ya, stature
Your broken looks more like a fracture, catch that rapper
Latifah will be back to crush ya, go buy a heart
'Cause from the start I told ya no one getting near
Latifah's had it up to here
Give it to 'em Queen, who got it?
Give it to 'em Queen Latifah
Give it to 'em Queen, who got it?
Give it to 'em Queen, the flavor unit
Give it to 'em Queen, I got it
Give it to 'em Queen, Latifah
Give it to 'em Queen, DJ A D
Give it to 'em Queen, ease off
