It's young jizzle from the bottom of the map
Got a 50 round clip on the bottom of the strap
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay , ay, ay, ay
I do it for the trappers with tha tha tha rocks
And them ole G niggas with tha tha tha blocks
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay , ay, ay, ay
I'm strapped up
I'm iced out, a nigga play, it's lights out
Cost a cool quarter million, that's how you'll find me
Swirvin' through traffic with them ghouls behind me
Ya betta call ya crew, you gon' need help
Hole car strapped and I ain't talkin' seat belts
Red cross nigga, yeah we draw blood
Hole team got choppers like a bike club
I don't get mad, I just get money
And laugh at these fuck niggas 'cuz they so funny
All a gangsta do is stay fresh
45 with the Gucci Teflons vest
It's young jizzle from the bottom of the map
Got a 50 round clip on the bottom of the strap
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay , ay, ay, ay
I do it for the trappers with tha tha tha rocks
And them ole G niggas with tha tha tha blocks
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay , ay, ay, ay
I'm on fire, the kids outta control
Competition want me to stop, drop and roll
Like I had a flame thrower and some gasoline
Set the city on fire that's on everything
I walk around like I got a grip in my pants
Yeah that's about 10 stacks, half a brick in my pants
Fish scale got papi on speed dial
Ya niggas gettin' raped ya still gettin' oil base
My flow is bananas, the coop is grape
Evisu jeans with the bathing apes
Dessert on the pillow choppers by the night stand
You can roll the dice play with your life man
It's young jizzle from the bottom of the map
Got a 50 round clip on the bottom of the strap
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay , ay, ay, ay
I do it for the trappers with tha tha tha rocks
And them ole G niggas with tha tha tha blocks
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay , ay, ay, ay
All that tough talk ya just wastin' ya breath
Hit ya ass with them things have ya chasin' ya breath
You got loose lips, ya betta put a collar on 'em
Black chenille frames I spent a cuple dollars on 'em
Whole zip of kush just to get my mind right
Aggression rolls, see the ones get my sound right
My money come fast so that's how I spend it
Trunk soundin' like it got a marchin' band in it
You in the minor leagues and I'm a heavy weight
Flippin' brick houses, we call it real estate
Five thousand for the pound get ya curb serviced
Sell a lot of grass like I got a lawn service
It's young jizzle from the bottom of the map
Got a 50 round clip on the bottom of the strap
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay , ay, ay, ay
I do it for the trappers with tha tha tha rocks
And them ole G niggas with tha tha tha blocks
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay , ay, ay, ay
