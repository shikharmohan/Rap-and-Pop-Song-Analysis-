The midnight murder two cop bodies on my heat 
Walk the street with a motherfuckin straight face 
Little shorty flip the script huh 
on any punk ass nigga or bitch 
The little brown skin buddha sucker little motherfucker 
I dwell in Juvenile Hell (yea yea) 
I got the shit that make you wanna catch a body quick 
Fuck em up bust em down Queensbridge style 
Street corner thug my title neighborhood partygoer 
Noreaga was my idle (yea) 
So what you wanna do nigga 
My knuckle game brought me fame in the project hallways 
I got mad props, for killin cops 
Little shorty hood, a little nigga no good 
My twenty-five weighs a ton so run 
I'm cockin back on your black ass B and it's like that 
Stomp em out kid, stomp em out (4X) 
Throw on my hoodie, when niggaz lit the Phillie 
I put a fuckin cap in the neighborhood bully 
What now, coward ass nigga - you ain't tough 
Fakin jax, I'ma call your motherfuckin bluff 
Niggaz that violate get me vexed 
Son got the mac, Noyd got the tec 
I'm catchin body baggin niggaz like deez up 
Town ? the ki's, flippin twenty-three G's 
Around the way bustin pills by the fuckin pound 
(??) Yeah kid, you know I got dat 
Jump in the hooptie, countin up my loot deep 
? on my vest in case niggaz wanna shoot me 
Niggaz blazin at my ride, but I don't give a fuck 
cause I retaliate, with the bullshit two-five 
It's only right, that I represent 
Sip on the E&J;, straight fuck around and get mega bent 
Me and my crew, wild for days 
Burn up the stage like a motherfuckin heat wave 
Learn to maintain, less stress on the brain 
Niggaz try to front, but they know my motherfuckin name 
Straight from the Bridge, yeah, you know my style kid 
I have you shook like a twenty-five to life bid 
[ragga chatta - can't make it out] 
[Big Noyd] 
Blowin niggaz out the frame, yes it's part of the game 
If your style ain't fit, you need to flip the script 
and get on it, you might think it's all about that bullshit 
But shit get real, with a mac and two clips 
Niggaz with a hoodie, hmm, somethin's up 
Thought you heard a scream, and next I heard a buck 
Bow, I knelt down, one knee on the ground 
I pull out the glock and Twin pull out the four pound 
Shit is real sprayin rocks on the block 
If you wanna carry G's you got to carry a glock 
and go all out, get down for your crown, don't fuck around 
Nigga tried to front, believe me get beat down 
and turn around get popped with the glock in a sec 
while your man got the tec to his fuckin neck 
You know my style kid, you know I'm wild kid 
Don't try to front that make me flip and catch a damn bid 
Representin from the 'Bridge, you know how it is 
My name is Big Noyd, stomp em out kid 
[Mobb Deep chorus while Big Noyd speaks]
