Look who just walked in the door
Look who just walked in, DJ Premier, huh, word up
Oh, you got Poet wit'chu, Blaq Po' whattup man
Yo, gimme some headphones
Yeah, distort the mic, Marley, I want you to distort the mic
We gon' do it like we used to do it
Aiyyo Premier, there the turntables
Do your thing man, rock on
The victory is almost there, just a little bit of
The victory is almost there, just a little bit of
KRS, Wild Style'n today
I stay controversial like Guantanamo Bay
My society is secret, sort of like the boulet
I'm not a average MC, I don't say what they say
I don't play what they play, I'm the type to find the needle
At the bottom of hay, that's why I'm rockin' today
Often they say "No way", until I say
Da-da-da-day and the crowd go "Hey"
From the time I stepped in the game
Kris been clear 'bout his rep and his name
I don't tolerate disrespect to my name
To uplift my people that's the reason I came
If you believe in peace then we believe in the same
If you believe in war I got that tec for your brain
If you think I'm a whore, man, you must be insane
I'm war in reverse like Big Daddy Kane raw
The victory is almost there, just a little bit of
DJ Premier
The victory is almost there, just a little bit of

The victory is almost there, just a little bit of
I know y'all motherfuckers ain't gon' believe this
Poet on the track with the nigga that dissed Queen's bridge
Let me show y'all how to bury the hatchet
The Blastmaster, with the Black Bastard, a classic
This is one for your dome
Niggaz must understand, it's hip-hop full blown
Gimme the mic, I'ma stay shittin'
I'ma stay rippin' and banana clip spittin'
Niggaz know, Blaq Po', green beret flow
It's nuttin' to me, I do it all day yo
The victory is almost here
I'm at the front line, yo, Kris, pull up on they rear
We got the shit surrounded, time to wild out
Nigga what you wan' do, nigga don't ask me, this is your LP
Marley hollered at Preem, Preem hollered at me
Now I'm standin' here warrior, reppin' QB
Nigga what's really good, what it's gon' be?
The victory is almost there, just a little bit of
DJ Premier

Marley Marl whattup
The victory is almost there, just a little bit of
This ain't what you're used to
KRS-One, Marley Marl, BDP with the Juice Crew
Who knew 20 years after Scott Marley Marl would pass the rock?
And I'd dribble it, dribble it, livin' it, nibble it a little bit
Before I enter the club and start killin' it
K-R-R, S-wah-wah-One
Yes they'd be the stars, me I'd be the sun
Jump right off the stage, breakin', breakin' you off
KRS is the best, of c-c-course
Street to the c-c-core, down by l-law
You the number 1 MC, oh sh-sh-sure
Meet me at the c-club, if you thinkin' you thug
KRS and Poet, this the type of hip-hop you love
The victory is almost there, just a little bit of
Marley Marl
The victory is almost there, just a little bit of
You rocked it, kid, you rocked it
The victory is almost there, just a little bit of
