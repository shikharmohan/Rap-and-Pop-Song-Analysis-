Uh, whatchu wanna do?
(So, so, def)
You wanna get down?
(Ah, get down, get down)
Whatchu wanna do?
(Ah, get down, get down)
Said, you wanna get down?
  (We got Snoop Dogg in the house, tonight)
Whatchu wanna do?
(With the homeboy JD)
You wanna get down?
(Ah, get down, get down, get down)
Whatchu wanna do?
(Get down, get down)
Check this out
Now, everywhere I go
They wanna see Don, Che, Che, O
Yes, obsessed with so, so, all my dough
How the jewellery glow and the Cristi' flow
Ain't no secret
I sleep with freaky premium bush
When I push, they push
And after we push, I leave her
'Cause I don't love her
(Ha, and me neither)
A, B, C, D, P, G, C, who could it be?
It's the D O double G
Known for the bone and the chrome on the D's
Gold credit card, backyard full of green trees
(What?)
Breeze through the summer in a Hummer with tint
Or dip in the low, low but that's just for promo
Never leave me alone without the dough, Doe
I'm so, so cold but y'all didn't know, Doe
Whatchu wanna do?
Say, you wanna get down?
Whatchu wanna do?
Say, you wanna get down?
Whatchu wanna do?
 (Get down on it)
Say, you wanna get down?
(Get down on it)
Whatchu wanna do?
  (Get down on it)
Say, you wanna get down?
  ('Cause we just wanna party with you)
To be a high roller, you need a pistola
And about a half a key of some Coca Cola
Now that I got older, I got a little colder
And I don't trip to get a chip off my shoulder
Mad dreams of a gangsta
Being like Cagney or Bogey but Snoop Dogg
Ain't no follower, man I'ma General
So when I put it down I gots to be so original
I'm quick to bust just like Daz Dillinger
But that's the little homie
And I'm the big homie Snoop Don Corleone
Spittin' it, hittin' it, while I'm gettin' that
'Bout it, 'bout it, and happy to shout out
I disappear 'fore the game get crowded
Take a trip overseas to the West Indies, freeze
JD
(Uh-huh)
Music please
I get goosebumps when the bass-line thumps
So fat, call me Professor Clump
Ain't nuttin' on the low, 'bout me I floss
And no, there's none of these chumps did I toss
On the track, better bring chips 'cause I cost
Million dollar company, then, I'm the boss
I don't sit back and watch, I go for it
Different coloured drops on the car port
Who's sure what you wanna do?
So, you wanna get down?
Whatchu wanna do?
(Get down, get down)
So, you wanna get down?
Whatchu wanna do?
  (Get down on it)
Say, you wanna get down?
  (Get down on it)
Whatchu wanna do?
  (Get down on it)
Say, you wanna get down?
  ('Cause we just wanna party with you)
Khakis on my leg, Lugz on my feet
I'm walkin' up the street while boppin' my feet
I'm fresh off the bus from Memphis, Tennessee
Head still spinnin' from the Coke and Hennessy
Sit down on it, nah, get down on it
It really don't matter 'cause you want it, Dogggonit
'Cuz, you must was buzzed
When you was bumpin' your gums, who you thought I was?
But look, I ain't even trippin' right now
It's like that there, bow, wow
So many styles, I could flip 'em like a file
Pop my drop top and let the beat rock
Dip through, course you do, miss you
But back to the issue, I wish you
Stop tryin' to clown the Pid-ound
'Cause you don't really wanna get down
Whatchu wanna do?
So, you wanna get down?
Whatchu wanna do?
(Get down, get down)
So, you wanna get down?
Whatchu wanna do?
  (Get down on it)
Say, you wanna get down?
  (Get down on it)
Whatchu wanna do?
  (Get down on it)
Say, you wanna get down?
  ('Cause we just wanna party with you)
All we wanna do is make you dance
No standing on the wall
Get your back up off the wall, c'mon
  (Baby)
All we wanna do is make you dance
No standing on the wall
Get your back up off the wall
('Cause I heard all my homies say)
You know it
(Uh, huh)
When you're dancin', yeah
  (That's right)
You show it
(Uh, huh)
When you move, move, move
  (Yeah)
You know it
(Do you wanna dance?)
When you're dancing, yeah
  (Come with me and dance)
You show it
(Do you wanna move?)
When you move, move, move, baby
  (I'ma make you move)
Come on
We gon let the beat go on like this, come on
Y'all wanna dance? I'ma make you dance
Y'all wanna move? I'ma make you move
You know it
