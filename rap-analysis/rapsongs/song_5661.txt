I-ya, 
I against I, 
flesh of my flesh, 
and mind of my mind, 
two of a kind but one won't survive, 
my images reflect in the enemies eye, 
and his images reflect in mine the same time, 
I-ya, I-ya, 
I against I, 
flesh of my flesh, 
and mind of my mind, 
two of a kind but one won't survive, 
Right here is where the end gon' start at, 
conflict, contact 'n' combat, 
fighters stand where the land is marked at, 
settle the dispute about who the livest, 
3 word answer, 
Whoever survive this, 
only one of us can ride forever, 
so you and I cant ride together, 
can't live or cant die together, 
all we can do is collide together, 
so I skillfully apply the pressure, 
won't stop until I'm forever... one! 
A door step where death never come, 
spread across time til my time never done, 
and I'm never done, 
walk tall, why ever run? 
when they move if I ever come? 
bad man never fret fuh war,we tell'em come 
general we an go start the madness fire bun 
I-ya, 
I against I, 
flesh of my flesh, 
and mind of my mind, 
two of a kind but one won't survive, 
my images reflect in the enemies eye, 
and his images reflect in mine the same time, 
I-ya, I-ya, 
I against I, 
flesh of my flesh, 
and mind of my mind, 
two of a kind but one won't survive, 
survive (x16)
Reign supreme in your U-N-I, 
V-E-R-S-E with the sharpness, 
narrow row building no space for partners, 
no space for drivers, no space for walkers, 
no space regardless, 
your on my path then get off it, 
hardheaded and unresponsive, 
get they lives put on target with harshness, 
come with the canons sparkin' they darken, 
who am i? one man squadron, 
Ma stir the fire this time that'd snatch your tomorrow, 
the thousand yard spear that'll pierce through your armor, 
you can get it on right now if you want to, 
but when ya front 9 get marched through, 
I warned you, 
You know who forever belong to, 
I-ya, I-ya 
I against I, 
flesh of my flesh, 
and mind of my mind, 
two of a kind but one won't survive, 
my images reflect in the enemies eye, 
and his images reflect in mine the same time, 
I-ya, I-ya, 
I against I, 
flesh of my flesh, 
and mind of my mind, 
two of a kind but one won't survive, 
my images reflect in the enemies eye, 
and his images reflect in mine, survive
