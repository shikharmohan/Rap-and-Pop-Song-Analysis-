Baby whats up with you tonight,
you wanna get busy I can read your mind,
baby, I can see you looking,
pour some champagne and you might get lucky,
touch on me, touch on me,
gimme gimme honey,
I dont want ya, want ya money,
I just want you get on me,

I've been checking you from across the room,
money aint a thing baby, what it do,
aint no need to keep on waiting,
tell them other b-tches they can keep on hatin,
it's you that I want and i want what i want,
and I get it, get it, get it, get it, get it,
[Chorus]
Its all for you,

Uhhhhm
I know what you're looking for
Got you butt naked in the condo cooking for
A n-gga like Weezy, please say the baby
And just like im begging I please all the ladies
Ease off the Richtor Scale, lil girl
Make you feel it in your pussy to your f-ckin' fingernails
Im a beast with it baby, you ever had it beasted?
Leave that thing pink like Easter
Kiss ya on each of ya lips, yep all four of 'em
Dammn, shawty just wont let go of 'em
She gone need more of 'em, I leave that thing wetter
I beat that thing up and then I kiss it 'till its better
