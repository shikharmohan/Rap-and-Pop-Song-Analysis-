United minds of America
make your vocal chords reach the clouds and
touch the crowd of folks that overstand there's no jokes
we must network together as one &
tell the oppressor we'll take no less than
total justice a social setting yo I'm bettin'
we can stop new world order
start servin liberty may I take your order
free political prisoners without no question
let's give props where due
If it was you wouldn't you want to know
that someone cares for what you do so let's show
political prisoners, homeless humans, organizations
various movements
that the people in America have some discipline
to act on their belief therefore stress activism
although you are only one person
if for truth you still thirst well thirst then
make the difference by joining
some organization or some movement
let me explain the powers that be
are families of power with old money
Unfortunately on their souls hangs a sold sign
and in righteous sight they are so blind!
Infatuated with their power and their greed
they don't see that GOD is the answer
Greed has planted a seed within the souls of the 13 families
drug dealers and hustlers
All my brothers and sisters that are hustlers
selling crack cocaine to your followers
to me you're a sell out an uncle Tom
in the tom tom club droppin bombs
Causing confusion shootin and killin'
you're playin the role putting fear in populations
making us allow the system to "protect" us
allowing the chicken snake to protect the chickens
police brutality claiming victims
the powers that be may come with their solutions
but trust me their trees bear No fruits no
I guess that's why I get spiritual
spirituality supports reality no not catholic no not Baptist
no not passive
very active!
United minds of the Americas
minds of Africa and the Caribbean
and the Europeans and the Asians and Australians
it's not just race we're all in this together!
Lets play a game of jeopardy what's the question?
Social Medicines the answer
I try to eat healthy to avoid the cancer
one ounce of prevention beats 100 pounds of cure
pure ways of living is not hippish
it's not white not black it's just conscious
conscious of your health, conscious of your self
instead of being so damn conscious of your wealth
(or lack of so...)
DO you know about the Panthers,
the MOVE organization, Kwame
Nkrumah, the Zulu nation or just Nikes and Pumas
or your fascination with the so-called B-Boy fashion nation.
If you can please recycle
even the people in the hood please recycle
I know it wasn't our fault that they went psycho
they meaning industry exec's who flex for profit!
Traditional societies and islanders
please retain your culture and don't give up!
Don't you understand we must understand this
if we want to live in bliss
