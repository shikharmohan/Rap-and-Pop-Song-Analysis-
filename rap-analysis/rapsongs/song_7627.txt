I told y'all niggas I was comin' back hard, nigga
Oh, you ain't heard this shit since Thug Motivation, nigga, okay
Hey, hey, hey, hey hoes ain't shit and money ain't nothing
And if it ain't nothing and then it gotta be something
And if it something and then it gotta be nothing
And if he ain't showed the cash then he gotta be bluffing
My dog hit me up, he say he got a lick
Got a bad jump shot, so he might shoot a brick
Talking records on my line, that's a technical foul
I don't know what the fuck you talking 'bout, I'm hanging up right now
Nigga, you ain't Nick Cannon and this ain't wilding out
I'm playing my position and I ain't trying to foul out
Here's the replay, ya we 'bout to find out
Hey, where's the referee I need to call a time out
If Young's what they want then Young's what they getting
They ask me what I do, I tell 'em teaching for a living
What you say nigga?
And I could show you how to make a mill right now
And I could show you how to make a mill right now
If Young's what they want then Young's what they getting
They ask me what I do, I tell 'em teaching for a living
What you say nigga?
And I could show you how to make a mill right now
And I could show you how to make a mill right now
Say he just touched down and he need a dutch downed
Second time he caught a date, think he going out of way
Thirty six holla at 'em, going for the first down
Feds playing defense every time he come around
We going to the super bowl if I make this field goal
Understand you gotta be, line man's turning me in three
He tripping 'bout that extra point, that man he want an extra joint
Make sure you bring my extra cash, next time I see your extra ass
Huddle up, call the play, ya I'm playing quarter back
Four way, two way, betcha I bring a quarter back
Weigh it up, bag it up, pass it to my running back
A dollar short on my pay, that's a flag all the way
If Young's what they want then Young's what they getting
They ask me what I do, I tell 'em teaching for a living
What you say nigga?
And I could show you how to make a mill right now
And I could show you how to make a mill right now

Ninth inning, bases loaded, I'm going for the grand slam
Tax free, tax free, I ain't giving shit to Uncle Sam
Young in playing softball, you playing softball
Yeah, I'm playing softball, same colors as golf balls
Catch me in the outfield, that's a whole lot of grass
Trying to buy the franchise, that's a whole lot of cash
Them rite I'm saving up, thinking I'm going to buy the team
Watch me get my bounty on, trying to keep my money clean
Focus quick, watch the pitch, can't afford another strike
If I make it through this shit then I can play another night
Money fight, money fight, gotta get my money right
But first I gotta get this hoes, so make sure that you wrapped 'em right
If Young's what they want then Young's what they getting
They ask me what I do, I tell 'em teaching for a living
What you say nigga?
And I could show you how to make a mill right now
