By dawn's early light
I shine brighter than the stars in the night
I'm bout ready for a fight
Come through and I've consumed enough juice
To cut loose and throw a mike to the moon
Since I'm the sun
I'll make you one, it's all for fun
I'm torching hot and all the same
From playing war games with saddam hussein
Now who's sane? I'm insane
My membrane's on cold grown
The tempature's rising, fry the cells in your dome
It might be on
And if you think so, you know me
It's tech the pony
The doggfather's little homey
[snoop doggy dogg]
Ain't that something
How I got little homeys now
I remember when I was just a little bow wow
Writing for my rep
Calling fore I step
Now I put niggas in the game just to stay on deck
High profile but my style low pro
Top dogg on the row, doggystyle ceo
And I blow the best indo
That you know of
So when I'm in your town
Dip down, and show love
You know what? what's up
Shit, I'm feeling good now
You better come and get me before I fall into a freestyle
[technic]
They say what's a rapper
Well nigga, what's an emcee
If they don't got the skills, then they don't roll with me
Ain't that the truth
I'm bulletproof off the roof
I got a mic and a fix
That'll jack you for your chips
I'm out for rep
But how long will it last
I'm coming up quick, cause broke niggas need cash
At last, I'm at the top so I maintain now
Gotta bang now
Nigga, this doggystle
[snoop doggy dogg]
All she ever wanted was a small time dub thang
Got my homey caught up in the coke game, dope game
He so sprung, on top of that he young
He's only thirteen years old and the world's so cold
He never took the time out to fall down on his knees
Until he fucked his gee, got some keys
Now they enemies
The niggas he grew up with
They put him in the game
Now they bout to take him out the game
Man, it's a shame, but you know how that shit go
That's life in the fast lane, so that's where I roll soop
[soopafly]
I'd rather not get shot
I'd rather sit in the studio and rock spots
Dogg pound, doggystyle, we're one big family
It's all dpg (dpg)
I got a gee on the best bomb money can buy
I ain't out for no homey's sides, I'm out to survive
Dogg pound, doggystyle, one big family
It's all dpg (dpg)
[technic]
Niggas and hoes will try to get you twisted
But I'm unlisted in the books
You base your life on that, you might get your life took
Put me in the game, I'm riding hard till I win
Serve a crew, kill a few niggas till the end
I mean, I'm a fiend for superior green
And all my life I got advice from a superior team
I gotta stay away from the cash see
Don't get blasted
Tell my kids how I lasted
My crew's mafiosos
So my philoso-
Phy is to gee till the day I d-i-e
