Listen, you've got to put that bitch in her place
Even if it's slapping her in her face

I went to your house, your girl came in and started cussing you out
You should have slapped her in her face, I wanted to tell you
But it wasn't my place, I kept it on the low, 'cause I know you
Was gonna check that hoe, but instead, you was quiet as a mouse
Maybe you started to think it wasn't your house
'Cause she was acting like a nut, you got a kind of bitch
That would kick your butt, what kind of pimp holds back?
Never met a bitch that a pimp can't slap, what's wrong with the pimpin'?
Why you get a whippin'? All I got to say is this

This is what you made me do, I really didn't want to put hands on you
But bitch you playin' with fire, I'm so sick and tired
Of loud mouth bitches like you, a nigga had to go and put tips on you
'Cause bitch you playin' with fire, I'm so sick and tired
This is what you forced me to do, I really didn't want to put hands on you
But bitch you playin' with fire, I'm so sick and tired
Of loud mouth bitches like you, a nigga had to go and put tips on you
Bitch you playin' with fire, I'm so sick and tired
