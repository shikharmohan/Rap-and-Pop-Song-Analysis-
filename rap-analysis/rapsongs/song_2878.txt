Oh yeah, as we celebrate hip hop, baby
Yeah, it's Ghostface and the man Kid Capri
I just want to celebrate
Like my squad won the Super Bowl
I just want to celebrate
Like we bangin on New Years Eve ya'll
I just want to celebrate
Like we just beat trial
I just want to celebrate
We hype for just bein' here
Stones on every arm, the crib is ten million
The corks from Dom Perignon can't reach my ceiling
Four maids with four grenades
When the sun's in my face, all I do is lower the walls for shade
The pool's a pain in the ass, fifty grand on Windex kid
They keep it clean the whole bottom is glass
So you can see the sharks and piranhas, a pair of pajamas
That's my neighbor, the faggot disrespecting my mama
No cars in the garage, it's underground shit
They way the floor open up you think I'm hiding spaceships
French chefs, the best grapes on they breath
Louie aprons on the Yank cats, the puffy cooks the rest
Besides I got birds that never leave the nest
They fuck with me, I watch em confess, then I go rest
Get back up, deposit them checks
Muthafuckas fuckin' up a good time by snappin' your necks, come on
I just want to celebrate
Like my baby's first steps you heard
I just want to celebrate
Like my first time platinum ya'll
I just want to celebrate
Like my first piece of nookie, oh
I just want to celebrate
We hype for just bein' here
Money for everybody, candy to the kids
Catch me on dateline, Starky too big
I'm like a mannequin, I stay jig
Mansion parties for all star weekend in my L.A. Crib
We came to party, run out of Goose, we got Dollies
Shorties wettin' me, check out her body, oh
Throw up your hands like it's your birthday, mommy
Let's celebrate, now I got her girlfriends behind me
Now I'm in the middle, watch is all chiseled
I can holla at the birds like Dr. Dolittle
What's that in your pocket Ghost? A Dill pickle
Not that, oh, that's the forty five stainless nickel
I'm pullin' a green, gotta G for the biggest ass
On the floor who look right in them jeans
If you fat, I might take one for the team
But I gotta get drunk first, know what I mean, come on
I just want to celebrate
Like we won the Power Ball money
I just want to celebrate
Tony Starks won an Oscar ya'll
I just want to celebrate
Like all of my goons just came home
I just want to celebrate
We 'bout to have a good year
Na, na, na, na, na, you can't catch me
I'm not like Thomas in, in a five fifty
Police be fiendin' to frisk me
I'm so legit I walk away with the car keys, pissy
Back at the labo, shorty wop need  Dutch
He fuckin' wit a Goose dick, tonight I'ma beat it up
Your thing to wet, you sure you ain't seeded up
That's how I get Ghost, especially when you eat it up
My goodness gracious, ass is flirtatious
Move it around like a snake miss or sexy waitress
Ghost don't have no patience
I like you, I usually change chicks like radio stations
Definitely not lookin' for love
But if you give it to me right now, I might say, I was
You can chill if you want, I got crazy bud
But before we do what we do, go jump in the tub, come on
I just want to celebrate
Throw ya hands up nigga
I just want to celebrate
Pop the 'pagne, pop the cork
I just want to celebrate
Representin' on the streets of New York
I just want to celebrate
We 'bout to have a good year
Yeah, we gets it in, gets it in, gets it in
New York, we been had it, we gets it in
Outta town we fuckin' up but gets it in
Worldwide we doin', we gets it in
The Ghostface, Kid Capri, I gets it in
That's no joke, when we here, we get it in
No kidding, in the building, getting it in
All day, getting it in
