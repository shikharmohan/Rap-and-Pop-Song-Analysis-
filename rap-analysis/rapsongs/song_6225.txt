Once upon a time up in Jersey, yo

("Who is it?")
Haha, it's Funk Doc here to pay a little visit to ya

I heard them niggaz in the Bricks get smoked a lot
I heard them niggaz out in Brooklyn get smoked a lot
I heard them niggaz all Uptown get smoked a lot
I heard them niggaz out in Queens get smoked a lot
  (Yo, yo, yo)
I smoke your budha to the last drop like I was Maxwell
If blunts came in degrees, call me a black-belt
I'm worldwide chinky, Hun-Tao with chrome inky's
Chicken ridin' shortie and she boost all her dinky
This is your brain, this is my tape on drugs
If your lame ass can't feel it, then your cord unplugged
P.P.P smoked your weed, ain't nobody around
You just got clowned for a whole half a pound, check it out now
I do a lot of stupid shit when I be smokin'
One time I left my truck runnin' in Brooklyn wide open
I forget who I call, ask for Nia and it's Tonya
  ("Hello, can I talk to Nia? Nia? Oh shit")
Click over
  ("Whassup bitch?""Oh, hi momma")
Yo, when I'm on stage rhymin' I forget what state that I'm in
The bitches numbers I lost, my baby momma find 'em
I played the lottery, forty million that day
I probably won the motherfucker but I forgot that I played
  (Yo, yo, yo)
Once upon a time up in Jersey, yo
Ha-ha I damn near had to wreck a hoe
Yo, I knocked on her do'
("Who is it?")
Hah, it's Funk Doc here to pay a little visit to ya
  (Oh, motherfucker)
I heard them niggaz up in Cali get smoked a lot
All them niggaz in Atlanta get smoked a lot
I heard them niggaz in Virginia get smoked a lot
I heard them niggaz in Rhode Island get smoked a lot
  (Yo,yo, yo)
When I get high I start throwin water in the crowd
Battle MC's off the top, slaughterin' a child
Detroit call it Ganz, Miami call it Krip
No matter what you call it, it be peelin' back my shit
Ay-yo Cali niggaz got bomb, shit that same bomb
Made me forget my momma's birthday and it's tattooed on my arm
I misplace my Lex keys every time I be zee'd up
I was caught puttin' Christmas trees up, and it was Easter
Do y'all motherfuckers feel high tonight?
Knowin' y'all niggaz shouldn't drive tonight
Yo, however the plan go, close the Caravan do'
So, we can all die and get high off of secondhand smoke
Brick City got the Pep, empty out your Black N' Milds
Smokin' the L with Doc earn frequent flyin' miles
I flew around the planet with my weed tucked in
I need to go to E.O. rehab and sign my stankin' ass in
  (Yo, yo, yo)
Once upon a time up in Jersey, yo
Ah-hah, I damn near had to wreck a hoe
Yo, I knocked on her do'
("Who is it?")
Yo, it's Funk Doc here to pay a little visit to ya

I heard them niggaz up in Yonkers get smoked a lot

I heard them niggaz in Detroit get smoked a lot
Lot, lot, lot, lot
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo motherfucker
