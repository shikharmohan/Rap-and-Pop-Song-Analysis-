[malcolm x]
Stealing runs rampant in harlem
Gambling runs rampant in harlem
All types of evils and uhh, vices that terrified our community
Run rampant in harlem
[big l]
The microphone is through when this rap legend grab it
Sendin poems to have them faggots diggin hoes like reverand swaggart
L's the nigga that crime follows
I'm hittin fine models and stabbin punks with broken wine bottles
I beat chumps til they head splits, then break em like breadsticks
I sex chicks, I'll even fuck a dead bitch
Always sprayin tecs, because I be stayin vexed
Some nigga named dex, was in the projects layin threats
I jumped out the lincoln, left him stinkin
Put his brains in the street
Now you can see what he was just thinkin
I'm chokin enemies til they start turnin pale
Satan said I'm learnin well, big l's gonna burn in hell
Front and get scarred cause your rap style ain't even hard
I run with a thievin squad, and none of us believe in god
Chorus: mcgruff, big l
[mcg] cause one-three-nine and lennox is the danger zone
[big] where no man can withstand or hold his own
[big] cause one-three-nine and lennox is the danger zone
[mcg] where no man can withstand or hold his own
[big l]
I got styles you can't copy bitch, it's the triple six
In the mix, straight from h-e-double-hockey sticks
Every sunday, a nun lay from my gun spray
Fuck carlito, we doin' shit the devil son's way
Every minute, my style switches up, they said a real man
Won't hit a girl well I ain't real cause I beat bitches up
I use words that's ill, l got nerves of steel
I'm cool, but every now and then I get a urge to kill
I'm takin lives for a great price, I'm the type
To snap in heaven with a mac-11 and rape christ
And I'm fast to put a cap in a fag chest
The big l smash stress, cause hell is my address
I'm on some satanic shit, strictly, little kids
Be wakin up cryin, yellin, "mommy big l is comin to get me!"
Chorus 2x
[big l]
I keep a cutie with a soft booty, hoes be runnin up
"can I get your autograph l? " no bitch, I'm off duty
I'm breakin hottie hearts, niggaz drop when my shotty sparks
It ain't no food in my fridge; just body parts
I keep the gear fresh, I keep the braids rugged
I never wear rubbers bitch, if I get aids, fuck it!
A beef with me, you better prevent it cause in a minute
I'll jump out a tenant rented, and leave a nigga body dented
And my swoll knob your main girl cold slobbed
And gave a blow job to my whole mob, with no prob'
Aiyyo crazy bitches slept with l
Then they niggaz got mad and tried to step to l
But I'm sicker than a nigga that's in special ed so I suggest
You spread pretzelhead, 'fore I turn your white sweatsuit red
Chorus 2x
