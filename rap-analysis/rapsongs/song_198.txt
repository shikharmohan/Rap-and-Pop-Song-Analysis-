Yea, G-G-G-G-Unit
Ha ha
It's easy to see when you look at me
If you look closely, 50 don't back down
Everywhere I go both coasts wit toast
Eastside, Westside, I hold that mack down
Every little nigga you see around me
Hold a gun big enough to fuckin' hold Shaq down
Next time you in the hood and see an ol' G
You ask about me, the young boy don't back down
Any living thing that cannot co-exist with the kid
Must decease existin' little nigga, now listen
Yo mami, yo papi, that bitch you chasin'
Ya little dirty ass kids, I'll fuckin erase them
Your success is not enough, you wanna be hard
Knowin' that, you get knocked, you get fucked in the yard
Youza poptart sweetheart, you soft in the middle
I eatcha for breakfast, the watch was an exchange for your necklace
And your boss is a bitch, if he could he would
Sell his soul for cheap, trade his knight to be suge
You can buy cars but you can't buy respect in the hood
Maybe I'm so disrespectful 'cuz to me you're a mystery
I know niggaz from ya hood, you have no history
Never poked nothin' never popped nothin' nigga stop frontin'
Jay put you on, X made you hot
Now you run around like you some big shot
Ha, ha pussy
It's easy to see when you look at me
If you look closely, 50 don't back down
Everywhere I go both coasts wit toast
Eastside, Westside, I hold that mack down
Every little nigga you see around me
Hold a gun big enough to fuckin' hold Shaq down
Next time you in the hood and see an ol' G
You ask about me, the young boy don't back down
The record is all fucked up now, what we gonna do now?
How we gonna eat man? 50 back around
That's Ja's lil punk ass stickin' out loud
Southside, tie-dyed, that's just how I get down
I'm back in the game shawty, to rule and conquer
You sing for hoes and sound like the cookie monster
I'm the hardest from New York, my flow is bonkers
All the other hard niggaz, they come from Yonkers
It's been years and you had the same niggaz in the background
You never gonna sell Mitsubishi Tah's crack child
Them niggaz they just suck, they no good
I ain't never heard a nigga say "They like them in the hood"
I'm back better than ever, on top of my game
Even them country boys sayin' "50 we feelin' you mayn"
Now you stay the fuck outta my zone, outta my throne
I'm New York City's own bad guy bad guy
It's easy to see when you look at me
If you look closely, 50 don't back down
Everywhere I go both coasts wit toast
Eastside, Westside, I hold that mack down
Every little nigga you see around me
Hold a gun big enough to fuckin' hold Shaq down
Next time you in the hood and see an ol' G
You ask about me, the young boy don't back down
I ain't tellin' anyone you pussy
I ain't tellin' anyone you gettin' extored
It ain't over G-Unit
I've been patently waitin' to blow
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 50 cent show
This is my life, my pain, my night, my gun
Now that I'm back, you can't sleep
I'm a nightmare huh
You hired cops to hold you down 'cuz you fear for your life
You heard about them guns I done bought, right?
I ain't goin' nowhere, I done told you nigga
I'ma G-Unit motherfuckin' solider nigga they not gon' like you
I know, I know ha, ha G-Unit
Oh no he didn't say anything about Ja
Okay? Ja is my boo, ok? Jeffery Atkins ain't never hurt nobody
And y'all know big thangs come in small packages, holla!
Now everythang was cool, until, 50 Cent, came back into the picture
They better not put they hands on Jeffery!
Ok first of all, they don't know that I am a 12 degree pinkbelt
Okay I will dice his ass up like a little piece of celery
Okay 'cuz see, they don't know me, Delicious, do they know me?
Okay, I thought so
'Cuz you know that I know karate, and I will see him
And I will "Jet Li" his ass!
Whitaaaah!
