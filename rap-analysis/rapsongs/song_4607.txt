I've Been Lonely
I've Been Waiting For You
I'm Pretending
And Thats All I Can Do
(Thats All I Can Do Mama)
The Love I'm Sending Ain't Making It Through To Your Heart
I shed tears 'cause I'm told that they'll heal
To tell the truth I don't know how to feel
Never feel alone in a room full of friends
Got big plans but you leave 'em in suspense
Pray for me, patience wait for me
Pay dues, trust me they ain't comin
Way back it was hoops, now it's Maybach coupes
And we all took a vow, no squares in the loops
Now we lookin at each other, sittin in a court room I'm laughin, cause it's lookin like a cartoon
Never snitch, got it tattood by kartoo?
(somebody switch) by my rules we all lose
You've Been Hiding, Never Letting It Show
Always Trying, To Keep It Under Control
(I See You Hidin' It Mama)
You Got It Down, And Your Well On Your Way To The Top
(Keep Doin' Your Thing)
But There Is Something You Forgot 
You Forgot About The House, You Forgot About The Ring
I Remember Everything, I Just Wanna Hear You Sing
I Remember The Love, Right After The Fights
You Can't Tell Me You Don't Remember Those Nites
And If I Would Cry, You Would Cry Twice
To Me You Are The Brightest Star Under The Sunlight
See Take Away My Title, Take Away My Stripes
You Give Me Back My Girl And You Give Me Back My Life
Give Me Back My Girl And You Give Me Back My Life
See This Is Just A Nightmare, So I Blink Twice
Open Up My Eyes Hopin' She Be In My Sight
I Remember The Time, I Wish I Could Bring It Back
What She Mean To Me, Is What I Mean To Rap
You've Been Hiding, Never Letting It Show
Always Trying, To Keep It Under Control
You Got It Down, And Your Well On Your Way To The Top 
But There Is Something You Forgot
Fortune n fame are pleasures you couldn't fathom
But fortunately for me my fortune built me a palace
Benjamins by the pallet, I'm spendin 'em mighty daily
I know I'm under surveillance ( I look at it as a talent)
Millions a gotta manage, lil talents up in the rappin I'm such a threat to these n*ggaz (you never know what could happen)
I started without a coin, not knowin which way I'm goin
Now I'm chatering boeings n readin a few poems
Weathered all of the storms, now its time to see the light
And I never felt this way bout anything in my life
Determined to be the best, not lookin back at regrets
How many people you blessed is how you measure success
I've Been Lonely
I've Been Waiting For You
I'm Pretending, And Thats All I Can Do
The Love I'm Sending Ain't Making It Through To Your Heart
