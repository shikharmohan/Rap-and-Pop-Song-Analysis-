You tell me that there's love here
But to me it's blatant
Nothin' but all the blood here
I'm dealin' with Satan
Plus with all the hatin'
It's hard to keep peace
  (Uh huh)
Thou shall not steal
But I will to eat
I tried doin' good, but
Good's not too good for me
Misunderstood
Why you chose the hood for me
Mean I'm aiight
I just had to work hard at it
Went to gran'ma for answers
An' she told me that God had it
So now here I am
Confused and full of questions
Am I born to lose
Or is this just a lesson
And who it's goin' choose
When it gets turned around
And will it be layin' in my own blood
And on the ground
My child, I've watched you grow up
And I've been there
  (Uh huh)
Even at those times you least suspected it
I was there
And look at what I've given you
A talent to rhyme
I may not come when you call
But I'm always on time
Somebody's knockin'
Should I let 'em in
Lord, we're just startin'
But where will it end
Somebody's knockin'
Should I let 'em in
Lord, we're just startin'
But where will it end
But when the funds are low
The guns'll blow
Lookin' for that one that owe
Make 'em run that dough
No!
Put down the guns
And write a new rhyme
You'll get it all in due time, you'll do fine
Just have faith 'cuz you mine
  (Uh huh)
And when you shine
It's goin' be a sight to behold
So don't fight to be old
Or lose sight when it's cold
See that light down the road
It's goin' guide you there
Two sets of footsteps
I was right beside you there
But what about them times I
Only saw one
Those were the times when I was
Under the gun
It was then
I carried you my son
Led you to safety
It just wasn't your time to face me
  (Uh huh)
Ayo a few of them times
I thought you would erase me
But all you did was embrace me
Prepared me for the worst
Offered me eternal light
And scared me with the hearse
And the curse turned to grace
When the hurt turned to faith
No more runnin'
  (Uh huh)
And slidin' in the dirt
'Cuz I'm safe
Somebody's knockin'
Should I let 'em in
Lord, we're just startin'
But where will it end
Somebody's knockin'
Should I let 'em in
So if I'm yo' man, I'm in yo' hand
Wus yo' plan
Never had a friend
'Cuz you couldn't trust your man
Learned to stand before I crawled
Things were twisted
And if you showed me anything at all
Then I missed it
Looked the wrong way
  (Uh huh)
I've done some wrong things
  (True)
Kept a bad attitude
But that's what wrong brings
And now you mean to tell me that
After all this time
It was you that kept the dog
From goin' out of my mind
It was you that breathed life
Into my lungs when I was born
And it was you that let me know
What was right from what was wrong
And it was you that let me do
What I knew what could be done
And it was you that gave me a good wife
And a beautiful son
And it's been you speakin' to me
Inside my mind
And it's been you who has forgiven
Time after time
It was you who opened my eyes
So I could see
And it was you who shined yo'
Light on me
