Doom, doom, doom, doom
Me killa, me killa, me killa
Drug dealers, and less niggas
'Less niggas, 'less niggas
Come again me say me killa
Me killa, me killa
Gravedigger, and less niggas
'Less niggas, 'less niggas
Caught 'cha slippin' so I had to put a slug up in your chest
Should have worn that vest
Talkin' shit'll only get your ass put to rest
So nigga come come flex
Hey, get the llello, don't fuck with the Bone
When I'm hangin' and bangin' and slangin', swangin' blows to the dome
Nigga watch that chrome, body bag that ass on home
Killa, me killa
