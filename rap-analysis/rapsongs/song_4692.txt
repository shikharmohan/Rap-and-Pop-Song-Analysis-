While my man plays the piano for us
Sip somethin' mellow and it's us while you're here
But of course I ain't sayin' nothin'
Okay, now that you know I know you know
That I know you know and that's the move so sit right here
Whisper in my ear caress my chest
And say somethin' smooth but don't forget I'll know what you'll say
Just what I thought I know the routine
