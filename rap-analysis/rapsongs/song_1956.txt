School street, Moulfred, Whitney Young
Been there, lived there, now it's become
A place where the face I'm not familiar with
These new cats done got me on some "I'ma kill you shit!"
And I remember when you came through flyin', a 1 2 9
Scooped ya man up and he signed to the line
I got a deal, shit I'm still in the grind
Got the steal, 'cause shit is still on my mind
You got to watch niggaz that you talk to
'Cause sometimes they talk to you funny, whass up wit'chu money?
Oh you think it's sweet? My name must be Honey
Funny, 'til you leave with your head bloody
And what he gon' do when a 6 foot 3
430 pound motherfucker come through?
Nothin'! Breathe easy!
