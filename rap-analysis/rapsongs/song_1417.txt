How y'all feelin' out there
You're listening to the Rap De Rap show
And I'm the Doo Doo Man
Playing all the slammin' rap tunes
For you Mack Daddies and Mackettes
So hold tight for a one hour rap sweep on WRMS
Who's the Doo Doo Man?
You're the Doo Doo Man
Who's the Doo Doo Man?
You're the Doo Doo Man
You're listening to MC Rocco Ribs and the BBQ Crew
And when we're not burning that pork
We're in New York listening
To the Rap De Rap Show on WRMS
This is Kim KC and I'm chillin' with the Suckwheat Posse
And when I'm not home making a ham hock sandwich
I'm listening to Rap De Rap Show on WRMS
You ravioli heads, we outta here, ooh, ooh, ooh, the Doo Doo Man
Yo, yo, what's up, 's up, this is Q Q Tip Tip
From a Tribe Tribe called Quest Quest Quest
I'm listening to the Doo Doo Man on WRMS-S-S and I'm out
Yo, my name is MC No Shame, and when I ain't
You busted in bed with your mama
Or sellin' crack to the kids at Amity ville High School
Hey, I'm listening to my man, the Doo Doo Man, on WRMS, peace
This this this this is De La Soul, Pos Love
WRMS y'all, with who? The Doo Doo Man
Yo, peace, this is the D I V Ine Styler Ine
And all come inside Divine
I'm listening to my man The Doo Doo Man
On WRMS, I am outta here
Yo what's up my name is Colonel Bobby
I'm listening to the Doo Doo Man on WRMS
Yo, and I'm outta here, peace
The JB's, Jungle Brothers, on WRMS
Like roaches lickin' soup
Checkin' out the Doo Doo Man
Yo, this is Prince Paul, when I'm not brushing my teeth
With DiDi 7 or boosting my memory or purchasing real estate tapes
I'm listening to my stromie, my homie, the Doo Doo Man on WRMS
Hey, hey, hey Paul, I got a job for ya
You know that guy Rufus? That mouli?
Freakin' lick him
