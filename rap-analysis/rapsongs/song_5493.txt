It's about to go down real fast and quick
We's about to go to war with these shotties and clips
Somebody's gonna get murked in the streets of New York
I keeps it thoro because i holds down the fort
My nigga Ski got it under control
And I will not stop what I'm doing till I get to old
Cause the streets needs me right now to make hits
And represent the hood I rep on my hits
On a song I talk about drugs and money
Selling coke and watcing crackheads live bummy.
