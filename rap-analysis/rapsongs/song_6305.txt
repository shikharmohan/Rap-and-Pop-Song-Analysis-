[Due to circumstances beyond anyone's control
The party is over at twelve o'clock
So whatever has to be done  has to be done right about now
And I say  Spinderella  are you with me?
Salt and Pepa  are you with me?]
I am down
To take it or to break it on the mic all night
'cause I'm Salt everybody  yeah  Salt
I'm the Pepa everybody  the Pepa
Come see the three
Young ladies in the fellas' fantasies
'cause we will be trendsetters to all MC's
Yeah, that's right, Money, this one's for you
Special dedication to the NYC crew
We didn't change much as you can see
And the beats are still hyped up by Hurby
In the house, crowds are packin'
They're all glad to see us back in step
Now flip if you oppose it, don't sweat it
I'm talkin' to those that's with it
This beat is strong not feable
Worse than ???, it's evil YOU SHOWED ME
