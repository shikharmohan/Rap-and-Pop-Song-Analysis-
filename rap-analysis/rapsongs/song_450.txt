It's for my, incarcerated niggaz
That stuck in the pin they coming home
Gotta stay strong 'cause you ain't alone
Remember you always got love from home
But still this pain and may not know it
I'm a boy and I gotta show it
I hear them cries from the babies
I wish they had a chance don't wanna blow it
But unemployed for all the little girls and boys
You got to love your mom and daddy
And make them wonder why you give them ploys
Oh boy, its getting deep but more expensive then ever cheap
But what about that little nigga running the streets
Making a living through his beats?
What about these whack ass politicians?
They don't care if we live or die
What about that elderly barely breathing? Gotta survive on SSI
They say America, it's the land of the free
And home of the brave it's mass hysteria
So bring your knees and hope we can fight and if bury us
At least we can live as we believe
Dog ain't ever gonna break our pride
Ain't nothing you can do to keep us weak
And all of my soldiers come together
Get on your feet and get ready to bust
What about this war against terrorism
(Fuck that)
And what about this war against us

What about them thugs that's dead and gone?
What about them thugs that ain't even grown?
What about them thugs that out here lost
And ain't ever gonna find their way home?
Suspicion got you furious, so grab your shit and listen up
It's violence and violence, it's the only way their gonna respect us
If it's this system, in the ghetto back far to one place one time
Know we gone, how they sleep at night if they know they be lying
This shit we deal wit', we young black and fit less
Living in the ghetto to ghetto
And ghetto to ghetto 'cause ghetto is all we know
They beat us down for dumb shit, they lock us up for dumb shit
Find out that I'm innocent and still gotta fight for money they owe me
And they wonder why we riot in the damn streets
They can't hold us down we getting all that money
And watch what I tell ya, everybody wants some
How they get it they don't care
Try to kick it when you spittin' real smooth
But they listening in my business, trying to fuck up my move

Dead niggaz, I've been to war
Been tall with shit, I seen it all
Like soap operas from ghetto stars
I can tell when rappers getting bored, really
Sometimes she a bitch, sometimes my lady
And times when niggaz die, she help like I was a baby
The simplest things in life were always the best
Breathing you ass back inhaling when chronic in your chest
Hey, somebody call my momma and help me one more time
Before I die my momma, she carry me no comma
Niggaz bitches and drama
I recollect walking and stoppin'
Cops not even checking on me
Juvenile delinquent and baby y'all be respecting me
The B.O. it taking me in
Whether we saving fuck the last thing we did
And let the cops see all the shit that I did
Like spittin' on them foxies skied up
In the palm of my dick
This is the life that I love
This is the life that I live
And it's a life full of lust nigga

My partner called me after court
He said they got 25 to life just for slingin' some dope
They making some cheese just to feed their folks
And they like somebody won't go home
It's sad 'cause its sadder for us
What about our boys and young girls
In their wicked young world?
Coming to school wit' heaters bustin' their teachers
Whatever happened to family and humanity we posses
What about our babies, that struggling in this mess, don't streets
Crooked coppers scaring the niggaz off in the hood
What about them niggaz that get blown off this block if they good?
See most of the niggaz still on the street
Still struggling and hustlin' trying to get something to eat
Some of them resting in piece and some will never get free
Bone Thug gotta show love, keep it real and really real
And let 'em know about us
