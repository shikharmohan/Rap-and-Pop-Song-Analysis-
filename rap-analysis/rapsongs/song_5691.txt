Feet they walk way and just that sheik posture

Famous like tapes made by DJ Clue

Yo check her she the nectar the bee get close to
I don't get many compliments, but I am confident
Used to have a complex about, gettin too complex
You got me, willin to try, looked me in the eye
My head is still in the sky, since you walked on by
I'm feelin high, got my imagination flickerin like hot flames
It's how it seems, you make me wanna ride the Coltrane to A Love Supreme
My brown lady, creates environments, for
Happy brown babies, I know it sounds crazy
But your skin's the inspiration for cocoa butter
You provoke a brother we should get to know one another

We're not dealin with the European standard of beauty tonight
Turn off the TV and put the magazine away
In the mirror tell me what you see
See the evidence of divine presence
Women of the, Carribean, they got the, golden sun
I know women on the continent got it
Nigeria, and Ghana, you know they got it
Tanzania, Namibia and Mozambique
And Bothswana, to let it speak
About latinas, columbianas
 
And the Bronx women walk that walk
Honies from Queens walk that walk, NYC, ATL, LA
Cincinatti, the Bay Area
