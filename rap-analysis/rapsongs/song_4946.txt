Get off me but I'm on you all day
Get off me, I don't think you wanna play
Get off me but I'm on you all day
Get off me, I don't think you wanna play
You wanna rush me
You can't touch me, trust me

And rusty, and busted
You betta' shop that
Make you pop up from lock up
But you tell your folks to hold
You're jack up to back up
(To back up)
I'm ready, so sit down or go ta' your room
It ain't nothin'
A, a watch out watch out, boom
Call me the hit man
'Cuz I make you wanna call time-out
Then I make your mom cry-out
When I take your ho fine-out
Then watch me take ya' and fake ya'
And shake ya', and break ya'
And see you on hold until you make her
You should give up now for talkin' shit like that
But then you noting, you garbag
You betta' watch ya' back
Get off me but I'm on you all day
Get off me, I don't think you wanna play
(Okay, okay, now)

We ridein' on pump

Get off me but I'm on you all day
Get off me, I don't think you wanna play
Get off me but I'm on you all day
Get off me, I don't think you wanna play
