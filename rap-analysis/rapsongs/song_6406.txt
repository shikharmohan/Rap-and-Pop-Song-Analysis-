Man, take another hit breathe out
In a zone blowing smoke out a glass teapot
I'm chillin at home on some solo shit
I love piece and when its quiet, I don't want no bitch
I don't want to look at lifetime, I'm fine with fuse
Fuck entertainment weekly bitch, find some news
I like Keyshia but I need some blues
Steady hollering about some time
Bitch I need some Room
Don't get me wrong ya'll I love females
That come around but after while, I need some self
I know I'm selfish at times but bottom line, move around if that ain't how you get down
Plus my album coming out real soon, I'm in the studio daily tryna write these tunes
And for you to stress a nigga like I'm running these hoes is outta line
Goodbye to your life, pack up your clothes and go
[Hook sung by Nina]
All I ever wanted was for him to see
Was that I was all the woman he would ever need
I've given all of me so unselfishly
And now he's at the door telling me to leave
Now where do I Go
I'm about to hit some spots with my guys from outta town
And there you go making those mean old eyes
Feel like I'm in prison sometimes
Like my freedom is gone like I've committed a crime and that's some bullshit
You watch a nigga like I'm 6 years old, how the fuck you think this shit gon' grow
I'ma tell you how this shit gon' go
I'ma hop off in this clean ass triple silver Porsche Turbo and hit the road and Go
You run a nigga blood pressure up from that spite shit 
And normally I don't fuck with that type bitch
But she got a nigga feeling her though
Text messaging my phone I feel like killing this ho
But before I let her get on my row
I'ma hand the bitch her walking papers letting her go and hit the door
But yo, I ain't never seen a UFO 
And I ain't never seen a ho that's more important that dough 
So Go
[Hook sung by Nina]
All I ever wanted was for him to see
Was that I was all the woman he would ever need
I've given all of me so unselfishly
And now he's at the door telling me to leave
Now where do I Go
I'm rolling late night with my buzz on
Leaving out a strip club and wanting my fuck on
I'm strolling through a list of my missed calls
And right up out the blue man this bitch calls
You coming over here (woman's voice)
I'm like shit naw
So to question that decision she eats up a dick raw
But man, I'd rather go to bed with a hard dick 
Than to have to spend the whole night fucking and arguing
This bitch a lunatic, fuck a nigga high off
I wish it was I way I could hit and just drive off
But that's not happening
So I'ma lay my ass down, watching girl's gone wild penis in my hand
Hardest times and I don't wanna sell out
Still I'm putting on my flip-flops to bail out
I grab my keys off the table and coat
It's an open invitation for a nigga to score, so I go!
[Hook sung by Nina]
All I ever wanted was for him to see

I've given all of me so unselfishly
And now he's at the door telling me to leave
Now where do I Go
