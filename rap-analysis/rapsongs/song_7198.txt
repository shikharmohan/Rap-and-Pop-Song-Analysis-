Let's get it Homeboy, y'all already know what it is man, this ain't that New York man

You like it ho, a couple years ago I woulda probably cut ya throat
Fuck it though, when im spittin something on the nucka fo
This well known flow, man i got this shit from simpson road
Adamsville, bowen homes, Center Hill to zone 4 
A drop top, flip flops, shine as the chrome glow 
Tip hop out the booth, what he up and Herndon homes fo 
Wit long dough, shit he just doin what he known for
Blowin dro, twenty fo, livin how the song go
Rubber bird, turnin, and beatin like a congo

[Verse2: T.I.]
I told ya I'm an O.G., never had cold feet
Ya in dough in O.T., f-nigga you don't know me
I knock ya out, put feet, put holes in ya till your clothes leak
Toss ya in the river like i threw away my old heat
You chose to oppose me, who the fuck ya supposed to be
My cannon filled, the Summer hill is on, three in the row wit me
No O's wit me, you know all the blow he fo is sold with me
I'm everythang you supposed to be, boy ain't no runnin over me
Kick it with the King and lemme show ya what i mean man
Most these niggas rappin bout a block ain't never seen now 
Real niggas recognize, real niggas lean now
You don't know how to stab a nigga dead and keep a clean hand
Sell a block for twenty four and you got the seventeen grand
For eastside niggas in curtwood and l'il vietnam
These twenty sixes keep the attention of bitches
Come and ride with me pimpin and lemme show ya how we get it
[Chorus]
Come and ride wit me nigga, let me show you where we kick it at
Where them suckers get it at, and hustlers keep them chickens at
Ride wit me nigga, let me show you where we kick it at
Where ho niggas be snitchin at, and often come up missin at
Ride wit me nigga, let me show you where we kick it at 
Where them killas livin' at and T.I.P. be chillin at
Ride wit a G, come and ride wit a G, all through the ATL'
Come and Ride wit a G
