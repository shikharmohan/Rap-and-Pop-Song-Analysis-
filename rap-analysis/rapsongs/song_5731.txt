(Let the sun shine)
Yeah, yeah, it's a brand new day, y'all
(Let the sun shine)
Turn me up in the top a little bit, dog
Want you to know, want you to hear this one
  (The sun's shinin')
Loud an' clear, bright an' early, listen
I don't hate players, I don't love the game
I'm the shot clock, way above the game
To be point blank with you, mother fuck the game
I got all this work on me, I ain't come for play
You can show the little shorties how you pump an' fake
But dog, not to Def, I'm not impressed
I'm not amused, I'm not confused, I'm not to dude
I'm grown man business an' I am not in school
Put your hand down youngin', this is not for you
On my J.O. with beats by Kanye, yo
My name on the marquee, your name off the payroll
Style fresh, like I'm still a day old
An' it's been like that since the day, yo
On more time than a Roley, or Seiko
Step on deck, your neck, do what I say so
Get up or get out, get down or lay low
(Let the sunshine)
Standin' in the shadow of a fabulous man
Brooklyn nigga, I am, Black Dante
(Let the sunshine in)
That nigga, that dude, black people, let's move
(The sun's shinin')
Shout out to my man, Talib Kweli, yes
We on top a, top a, shout a, shout a, check it out
Slim nigga that casts a big shadow
Cherokee red to shoot the long arrow
Got more skill, more aim an' more ammo
You can get it all from a big or small barrel
Like, 'Hail Mary', full of grace
Niggaz come in an' shoot up the place
An' make you pull up your face
The deck, Im'ma pull out the ace
From the jungles of the Empire State
Where it ain't no escape
Two four seven, seven one eight
An' thats like every night, every day
From the place that I settle an' stay
To the states, I'm collectin' my pay
Blast off then I'm back to the K
Hold it down so my family straight
Represent in a family way
Pro ball not for amateur play
Been raw since the amateur stage
Before the press had the cameras raised
Like a long time man of the way
  (Let the sun shine)
You understandin' me straight?
Yes, yes, no doubt, excellence
  (Let the sunshine in)
It's what it is, what it is
An' thats what it is, you see? Ha, fire
  (The sun's shinin')
'Cause it is deeper, sweeter, richer, crisper
Stronger reception an' sharper picture
Revolve around God an' involve with niggaz
These elements above all my scripture
An' make Mos Def a classic modern figure
Brooklyn, it don't matter if you holler or whisper
You're comin' through clear 'cause I'm right here wit'cha
Ain't gotta edit the slang, I got it, I'll get ya
Yo, brothers an' sisters, fathers an' mothers
The lovers, the leavers, the doubters, believers
The stayers, the quitters, the bitches, the niggaz
Rebel guerrillas, the ghetto civilians
Y'all 'gon feel it from the first to the millionth
It's extra ordinary an' plain
I walk a thousand paces of light ahead of the game
By the time you get where I'm standin', I'll be gone
Y'all make moves, but y'all just move on
I move in, an' y'all must move on
  (Let the sun shine)
'Cause I move to strong an' I know what my feet move for
Make it go without a brand new car
  (Let the sunshine in)
I was fresh without a brand new song
An' give a fuck about what brand you are
  (The sun's shinin')
I'm concerned what type of man you are
What your principles an' standards are
You understand me y'all
Be good to your family, y'all
No matter where your families are
'Cause everybody need family, y'all
Raise a hand, you understand me, y'all
Everybody need family, y'all
Be good to your families, dog
Understand, no matter where your families are
Everybody need family, dog
Raise your hands, you understand me, pa
That's what it is, that's my man
Family an' my family Pencil Pete
My man too, all our loved ones behind the walls
All of those who still in the struggle
Masada Malia, Son Dial la, Magic Mel
(Let the sunshine in)
Life is real
All the real soldiers, black people, we family y'all
  (Let the sunshine in)
(The sun's shinin')
Let it be bright
