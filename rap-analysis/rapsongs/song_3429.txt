[Pusha T - Chorus]
Doing my thing, pocket full of green
hand on my d-ck in my thousand dollar jeans
your girl a Queen, my girl a thing
you know what though? I'mma take, I'mma take this one for the team
[Kanye West]
I'mma take this one for the team
GOOD music
yeah you know what
I figured out I'm not a nice guy
I shook hands, kissed babies gave it a nice try
you know what I hate pictures of other peoples kids
I hate plastic couches in other peoples cribs
I hate when other peoples crib's smell like sh-t
I hate when I leave, I smell like the crib
whats the cause of the poor smell?
she said "I just cleaned up baby I can't tell"
why every ghetto b-tch gotta smell like Love Spell
or that God-damn cucumber bath and body works
I can still smell the sweat the sh-t hardly works
what about Cool Water that sh-t probably worse
is he a classic like the Ladi Dadi verse
and my man probably hollered at the hottie first
I score, he took the charge
ooooh, that sh-t gotta hurt
[Pusha T - Chorus]
[Pusha T]
Nevermind me, 'Ye have fun
if the cops ask, thats my gun
that's my weed, anything you need
I'mma take, I'mma take, I'mma take this one for the team
one fat ass, one flat ass
n-gga hit the switcheroo on my black ass
ever seen Joe's jeans on a jackass
and my b-tch got on tights with a tac ass
I'm a fly n-gga and I carry on
with the bottles of that Rose and Perignon
ever seen how a kingpin carry's on
dookie chain and a herringbone
real sh-t, gotta feel this
first class flights baby that's a field trip
double date don't cooperate, kill switch
f-ck me and my man, you a real b-tch
[Chorus]
[Kanye West]
Ladies and gentleman
it's G.O.O.D music in the house
and we got Keri
[Keri Hilson]
All I know you the one that I heard about
know you work your way up through word of mouth
plus I'mma have to test you in and out
it's a dirty job but sometimes you gotta take it for the team
take it for the team
take it for the team
take it for the team
(I like your mentality baby)
[Cyhi The Prynce]
I'm blowing on stinky that come in a jar
I'm playing with her kitty later come in the car
she a red bone but her cousin is dark
a little out of shape but you'll f-ck in the dark
until she start complaining 'bout her feet hurt
I'm trying f-ck, she talking she wanna eat first
I'm like why did this b-tch have to bring her
I'm tryna get her back to the nest so I can sting her
so I hit Big Sean on the ringer
I said I gotta chick for you that'd like a singer
on a scale of 1-10 she's a 15?er
meaner, shoulda seen a n-gga face when he seen her
he said the b-tch wasn't pretty enough to finger
though on my team she will be a fifth stringer
I said I got the fine one and the beamer
I'm the point guard and I need wing...
[Keri Hilson]
take it for the team
take it for the team
take it for the team
[Chorus]
[Kanye West]
