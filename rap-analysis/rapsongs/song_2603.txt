Eve, Teflon
Ruff Ryders, Def Jam
Yo, yo, many they pop shit but me, I drop shit and they cop it
Stay to myself most the time but still they plot shit
Bitches that's unstable, I can't be involved
'Less they wanna take it back to the street and problem solve
Touching y'all but me, I try to chill on the chicken shit
Sit back, do Eve, mastermind my business shit
You dat, screw all these cats, that's trying to end this shit
Hate me for the rest of your life, I'm just beginning it
Na, na, na, na
You wanna Ryde right
Na, na, na, na
Say anything for the limelight
Na, na, na, na
Just need to let me be
Na, na, na, na
Do you 'cuz I'ma do me
Na, na, na, na
You wanna Ryde right
Na, na, na, na
Say anything for the limelight
Na, na, na, na
Just need to let me be
Na, na, na, na
Do you 'cuz I'ma do me
Yo, am I made up? Just my make up, nothing fake though
Bitches generate bullshit, I generate dough
On the roll now, got control and I'ma keep it
Made my move, while y'all got comfortable, while y'all was sleeping
I remember being broke and I ain't trying to fall back
Nobody listened to my shit and I ain't get no call backs
Ain't no way that I could have it then lose it
Take my word, I'ma keep slanging shit, making hits, niggas, ya heard?
Na, na, na, na
You wanna Ryde right
Na, na, na, na
Say anything for the limelight
Na, na, na, na
Just need to let me be
Na, na, na, na
Do you 'cuz I'ma do me
Na, na, na, na
You wanna Ryde right
Na, na, na, na
Say anything for the limelight
Na, na, na, na
Just need to let me be
Na, na, na, na
Do you 'cuz I'ma do me
Yo, ayo, ayo, can you deal with the wild one
When she comes around trotting down Stallion?
Got they mouths open now
Bitches frown and I care less, just to get attention
They would wear less, staying mad at me but I'm they fearless
Ryde or Die chick, you know how I get down
Fifty dogs or more when I come through, how I get 'round
Got enough stress on my brain, size of stress from you dames
And I ain't even stressing no names
'Cuz I'm different, nothing like you bratty chicks bitching
Nothing like you whining ass niggas that's scared of itching
What is it you really want?
Begging for your chance then you front
Praying for a way that you could stunt, on this one here
E V E is ready for your faking all year
Smile in my front, no use they heated at my rear
Told you from the first attack, you shoulda been prepared
Huh, shoulda listened
Na, na, na, na
You wanna Ryde right
Na, na, na, na
Say anything for the limelight
Na, na, na, na
Just need to let me be
Na, na, na, na
Do you 'cuz I'ma do me
Na, na, na, na
You wanna Ryde right
Na, na, na, na
Say anything for the limelight
Na, na, na, na
Just need to let me be
Na, na, na, na
Do you 'cuz I'ma do me
Na, na, na, na
You wanna Ryde right
Na, na, na, na
Say anything for the limelight
Na, na, na, na
Just need to let me be
Na, na, na, na
Do you 'cuz I'ma do me
