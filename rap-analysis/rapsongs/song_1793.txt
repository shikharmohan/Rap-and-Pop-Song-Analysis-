When I come thru, everythin' gon' stop
When I come thru, everythin' gon' stop
When I come thru, everythin' gon' stop
Now move, move, move, move
When I come thru, everythin' gon' stop
When I come thru, everythin' gon' stop
When X come thru, everythin' gon' stop
Now move, move, move, move
X comes thru the hood, like here comes trouble
'Year Of The Dog...Again', first week, double
Low in the rider, East Coast ***
Fo' in the rider, street loc ***
Far from jiggy but like biggie, *** call me 'Big Poppa'
I got a big *** and I'd a pop her
Yeah, the kid talk straight but the kid don't front
How ever s*** go, 'Give 'Em What They Want'
I ain't signin' ***, love my fans
But cross this line with the camera in your hands
'Cause it could get real ugly real thick
And you like this *** will plug me real quick
Mother*** right, I ain't got time for the small talk
One of us has got to go down, we can't all walk
You know this as well as I do
But I promise you that I'm go hide you
And no one will find you
When I come thru, everythin' gon' stop
When I come thru, everythin' gon' stop
When X come thru, everythin' gon' stop
Now move, move, move, move
When I come thru, everythin' gon' stop
When I come thru, everythin' gon' stop
When X come thru, everythin' gon' stop
Now move, move, move, move
Stop, hold up, you know I don't quit
You see I'm back and I'm comin' to smash your s***
Groovy back with the Dog and Bus-A-Bus
This time I brought me a shovel
So I can come and dig another grave
For all of you bastards, what the f** you think you doin'?
I'll put a stop to your function and anybody movin'
And then I'll flop your production and any crew you flew in
You ain't with me, you against me
By the loser side you chosen anyways
Word to ears, you *** know I ain't finished
I'll f*** up every hood and I'm back to handle my business
You n*** thinkin' you though like you ate a can of spinach
Until we mash on you f*** and make you change up your image
Flipmode in this ***, Ruff Ryders is with me
You see we back on the block and yes, we runnin' the city
Now you *** know the flow less ain't controllin' the committee
Nothing' should be movin' unless my crew in it, you feel me?
When I come thru, everythin' gon' stop
When I come thru, everythin' gon' stop
When X come thru, everythin' gon' stop
Now move, move, move, move
When I come thru, everythin' gon' stop
When I come thru, everythin' gon' stop
When X come thru, everythin' gon' stop
Now move, move, move, move
If there is money involved, I want half
Funny to watch, go 'head, laugh
Ain't nothin' to smile about
For real, all *** is wildin' out
*** who pound you out
We found you out in a desert
Leg missin', head missin'
Somethin' like '28 Days' missin'
And you know how the desert do a ***
Brake you down quick, residue a ***
Can't stop the flow, stop and go
When ever I drop, a million out the door
Y'all *** know, X got to be *** with
Y'all run around on some dumb *** with a slump ***
Know I don't mind scrappin'
When I see you, I see you, what ever happens, happens
This ain't just rappin', talk a good one
You know what let that go, see me in the hood, son
When I come thru, everythin' gon' stop
When I come thru, everythin' gon' stop
When X come thru, everythin' gon' stop
Now move, move, move, move
When I come thru, everythin' gon' stop
When I come thru, everythin' gon' stop
When X come thru, everythin' gon' stop
Now move, move, move, move
