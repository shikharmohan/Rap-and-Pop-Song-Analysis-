Now my candy is so fresh, so clean
I break them boys off when I pull up on the scene
In my candy with ten coats sprayed tight
And that North side royal blue is settin' off the white
On my candy, sho' ain't the average paint
You go to Ike tryin' to buy it he gon' tell ya, ya can't
Have my candy, it's like a one of a kind
And you might have a painted slab but it ain't pretty as mine
'Cause my candy, worth mo' than money can buy
Brought it to Funkmaster Flex and seen a grown man cry
For my candy, sittin' on nuttin' but glass
Stoppin' traffic on the freeway when I fly past
In my candy, got no competition on the street
You can win a Dub car show and still can't compete
With my candy, 'cause it's the sweetest on the block
And I'm trill, workin' the wheel, that's why they all jockin' my candy
Candy, painted
(Break the boys on the ave 'cause the slab's so tight)
Drop top, El Do', ride
(Break the boys on the ave 'cause the slab's so tight)
Now my candy, is sittin' tall on them Vogues
It's like an alarm clock, wakin' up all the hoes
My candy, is wetter than high tide
And it's lookin' like I just had a blizzard inside
Of my candy, got mo' wood in it than a forest
One look'll get you hooked like a motherfuckin' chorus
My candy, drips an unerasable stain
It's real magic, not like that motherfucker David Blaine
My candy, it got the woman on the front
And a PhD in showin' niggaz how to stunt
My candy, it got the fifth up on the back
And it'll swang through your hood like it don't know how to act
My candy, the 8th wonder of the world
Like floatin' downstream when you're starin' at the swirls
My candy, ridin' real trill, stayin' true
And it's a legend in H-Town like DJ Screw my candy
Yes my candy is so sweet
Fadin' niggaz on these streets
People watch as I ride by
In my candy I'm gon' shine
Now my candy is so smooth, so laid
And these boys can't comprehend how the paint got sprayed
My candy, makin' people stop drop and stare
Pull out any car you want to but it won't compare
To my candy, it's like a four wheel mirage
That's too pretty to park in a motherfuckin' garage
My candy, it's like a part of the fam'
So lose my friends or my ends, I wouldn't give a damn
But my candy is an extension of me
So when you lookin' at my car you lookin at Bun B
It's my candy, player, throwed, fly
And you can't fuck with it no matter how hard you try
My candy, the other level of the game
If you ask me again, bitch I'ma tell you the same
It's my candy, yeah nigga mines not your
Long as I got syrup to sip and Swishers to burn in my candy
Break the boys on the ave 'cause the slab's so tight
Break the boys on the ave 'cause the slab's so tight
