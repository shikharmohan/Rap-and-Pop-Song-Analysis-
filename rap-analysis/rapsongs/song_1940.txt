Ahh
Somethin' new
Stop, drop, shut 'em down open up shop
Ohh, no
That's how ruff ryders roll
Stop, drop, shut 'em down open up shop
Ohh, no
That's how ruff ryders roll
Niggaz wanna try, niggaz wanna lie
Then niggaz wonder why niggaz wanna die?
All I know is pain, all I feel is rain
How can I maintain with mad shit on my brain?
I resort to violence, my niggaz move in silence
Like you don't know what are style is
New York niggaz the wildest
My niggaz is wit' it, you want it? Come and get it
Took it then we split it, you fuckin' right, we did it
What the fuck you gonna do?, When we run up on you?
Fuckin' wit' the wrong crew, don't know what we goin' thru
I'm a have to show niggaz, how easily we blow niggaz
When you find out there's some more niggas
That's runnin' with your niggaz
Nothin' we can't handle, break it up and dismantle
Light it up like a candle just 'cause I can't stand you
Put my shit on tapes, like you bustin' grapes
Think you holdin' weight? Then you haven't met the apes
Stop, drop, shut 'em down open up shop
Ohh, no
That's how ruff ryders roll
Stop, drop, shut 'em down open up shop
Ohh, no
That's how ruff ryders roll
Is ya'll niggaz crazy? I'll bust you and be swazy
Stop actin' like a baby, mind your business, lady
Nosy people get it too, when you see me spit at you
You know I'm tryin' ta get rid of you, yea I know it's pitiful
That's how niggaz get down watch, why niggaz spit round?
Make ya'll niggaz kiss ground, just for talkin' shit, clown
Ohh, you think it's funny then you don't know me, money
It's about to get ugly, fuck it dog, I'm hungry
I guess you know what that mean, come up off that green
Five niggaz or a fiend, don't make it a murder scene
Give a dog a bone, leave a dog alone
Let a dog roam and he'll find his way home
Home of the brave, my home is a cage
And yo I'm a slave til' my home is a grave
I'ma pull paper, it's all about the papers
Bitches talkin' paper then how they wanna rape us
Stop, drop, shut 'em down open up shop
Ohh, no
That's how ruff ryders roll
Stop, drop, shut 'em down open up shop
Ohh, no
That's how ruff ryders roll
Look what you dun started asked for it, you got it
Had it, should have shot it, now your dearly departed
Get at me dog, did I rip shit with this one, here I flip shit
Niggaz know when I kick shit it's gonna be some slick shit
What was that look for, when I walked in the door?
Ohh, you thought you was raw, boom not anymore
'Cause now you on the floor, wishin' you never saw me walk
Through that door with that four four
Now it's time for bed, two more to the head
Got the floor red, yea that nigga's dead
Another unsolved mystery it's goin' down in history
Niggaz ain't never did shit to me
Bitch ass niggaz can't get to me
Gots to make the move, got a point to prove
Got a make'em grove, got'em all like 'Ooh'
So to the next time, you hear this nigga ryhme
Try to keep your mind on gettin' pussy and crime
Stop, drop, shut 'em down open up shop
{Talk is cheap, motherfucker}
