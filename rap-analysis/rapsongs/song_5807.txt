You know what time it is nigga?
And you know who the fuck this is?
Danger, danger get on the floor
The nigga right here, sing it
Been so long since he's been on
So please show me
What it is that you want to see?
Go tell the D.J to put my shit on
I'm keepin' you niggas and bitches
In jump from the minute I get on
Takin' the shit off, showin' the tattoos
Screamin' and hollerin' and all
Got the gift to come up with it
Put it together, deliver it, make 'em feel it
Bitch I been on, sharp
Like you pulled me out the pencil sharpener
Bad, like that student in the principal's office
Put rappers in coffins, they dive like dolphins
I'm the [Incomprehensible] lyrical marvel
[Incomprehensible] officer, watch yourself
Or fuck around and get beside yourself
I know, go ahead though
Bounce them titties, shake that ass, drop that pussy
Stay in line hoe, fuck a think 'cause you can, can
Cocked up, head down, pussy poppin' on a handstand
Leave that pussy smokin', if you wanna lose somethin'
Bend over, and bust that pussy open
Been so long since he's been on
So please show me
What it is that you want to see?
Been so long since he's been on
So please show me
What it is that you want to see?
My fuckin' concert lyin' around the corner
Parkin' cars, niggas for their bitch, nothin' on her
You lookin' good momma, why? What's up homie?
Sirens, Limousines, and the club owner, ya bitch you
If you late, ain't no getting in this bitch 'cause it's fillin' up
Inside packed from the floor to the ceilin' up
The buildin' ain't big enough, I'm backstage bouncin'
Adrenalin buildin' up, the pussy cutter, did I stutter?
The heart flooder, make your woman drawers melt like butter
Down like Nelly, hype like belly
The rhyme seller, kick ass like Jim Kelly
Stand up, round out, boot up and frown
Tell a nigga if he wanna try it then bitch come on down
No sweat, no blood, no tears and if I tell you it's the shit
Then bitch that's what it is
Been so long since he's been on
So please show me
What it is that you want to see?
Been so long since he's been on
So please show me
What it is that you want to see?
Danger, talkin' 'bout, danger
Motherfucker look, get on the floor
The nigga right here, danger
Motherfucker, watch your back, danger
Look, look, nigga what? Look, look
Get on the floor, the nigga right here
Get 'em up
Been so long since he's been on
So please show me
What it is that you want to see?
Been so long since he's been on
So please show me
What it is that you want to see?
Danger, danger, get on the floor
The nigga right here, sing it
Danger, danger, get on the floor
That nigga right here
This is my motherfuckin' floor
