Biatch
Oh shit
Motherfuck
Hit the motherfucking floor babyyy c'mon, let's go!
Y'all looking for names, I'm looking for beats
Y'all looking for fame, I live in the streets
Y'all talk the talk, but I walk the walk
School street, home of the brave, New York!
Y'all make movies, but I make moves
Straight up, y'all got something to prove
Y'all niggaz duck, but I swing back
Y'all niggaz run, but I bring gats
Y'all niggaz whisper *X is a crackhead* 
Aight fuck it! I'ma just crack heads!
I bang niggaz that cross the line
Y'all niggaz talk shit from way behind
I stand my ground but Ya'll niggaz don't
Shit! I go to jail, but y'all niggaz wont
Y'all niggaz walk around and get scared 
I don't give a fuck! I DON'T CARE
I ain't a dancing nigga, I just move to the beat
Sit there and nod my head but won't move my feet
Gangsta, so I'm holdin' up the walk
That dancing shit up to the rest of y'all

Y'all niggaz are pussy, straight up ass
I'll keep that thing, and I'll blast
Letcha man know, he don't wanna push me
Remember, its you, not me thats pussy!
Y'all niggaz walk right on your tomb
I come through hard, kickin down doors
I spit a mean sixteen without a pause
then let sixteen go just because
Win it for the dough I'm in it for life
You've been jail, beating your dick
I'm fucking your wife
I'll bring the drama, I'll bring the noise
Kidnap yo momma, bring em to the boys
I make shit happen with one word
You take shit laughing nigger, use the bird
I take niggaz for everything they got
Thats why I'm the dog and you not!
I ain't a dancing nigga, I just move to the beat
Sit there and nod my head but won't move my feet
Gangsta, so I'm holdin' up the walk
That dancing shit up to the rest of y'all
