You are listening to the sounds of the RBGs
'Turn Off The Radio', tune your frequency
This is DPz nigga, 'Revolutionary But Gangsta', holla back
Hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop
(Come again, break them chains, come on)
Hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop
(Break them chains, come on)
Who shot 2Pac? If we don't get them they gon' get us all
I'm down for runnin' up on them crackas in the City Hall
We ride for y'all, all my dogs stay real
Nigga don't think these record deals
Gon' feed your seeds and pay your bills
Because they not Emcees
Get a little bit a lovin' think they hot
Talkin' 'bout how much money they got
Nigga all your records sound the same
I'm sick of that fake thug
R and B rap scenario all day on the radio
Same scenes in the video
Monotonous material, y'all don't here me though
These record labels slang our tapes like dope
You can be next in line and signed
And still be writing rhymes and broke
You rather have a Lexus? Or justice?
A dream or some substance?
A Beamer a necklace or freedom?
See a nigga like me don't playa hate
I just stay awake it's real hip hop
And it don't stop till we get
These crackers off out block
(C'mon)
We be DP RBG for life, 'Turn Off The Radio'
The revolution won't be televised
Turn off that bullshit
We be DP RBG for life, 'Turn Off The Radio'
One thing 'bout music when it hit you feel no pain
White folks take control of your brain
I know better than that, that's game and we ready for that
Two soldiers head of the pack, matter of fact who got the gat?
And where my army at? Rather attack and not react
Back to beats it don't reflect
On how many records get sold
On sex drugs and rock 'n roll
Whether your projects' put on hold
In the real world, it's just people with ideas
They just like me and you
When the smoke and camera disappear
Again the real world it's bigger
Than all these fake-ass records
When po' folks got the millions
And my sisters' disrespected
If you 'Check 1-2'
My word of advise to you is just relax
Just do what you got to do
If that don't work then kick the facts
If you a fighter, ryder, biter, flame-ignitor
Crowd-exciter, or you wanna just get high
Then just say it but then if you a liar-liar
Pants on fire, wolf-crier, agent wit' a wire
I'm gon' know it when I play it, it's bigger than
Hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop
(We be DP RBG for life)
'Turn Off The Radio'
Hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop
(The revolution won't be televised)
Turn off that bullshit
Hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop
(We be DP RBG for life)
'Turn Off The Radio'
Hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop
(The revolution won't be televised)
'Turn Off The Radio'
My neck, my back
They put a noose on my neck
And whips on my back
My neck, my back
You got a tie around your neck
But they breakin' your back
My neck, my back
They put a noose on my neck
And whips on my back
My neck, my back
And if you got bling on your neck
You better watch your back
Hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop
(Nigga it's bigga then)
Hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop
(It's still bigga then)
Hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop
(Nigga it's bigga then)
Hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop
'Turn Off The Radio'
