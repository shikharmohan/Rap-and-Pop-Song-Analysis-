Yeah, murda, murda, murda, kill, kill, kill
Murda, murda, murda, kill, kill, kill
I'm going to kill
Slowly I turn, step by step through the back window, I crept
Silent as a mouse on a set while everybody in the house slept
I disconnect the phones and the rest find a butcher knife
Cut the power lines to the lights now a nigga wild for the night
I come like the living death, straight from the dirt
Back to avenge his own death on this earth
Ever heard of Jason, then you know my work
Down to the basement, the dog get it first
I can't help myself, my thoughts ain't my own
The voices in my head just won't leave me alone
Murda, murda, murda, kill, kill, kill
Pissing on the car seats, flattenin' the wheels
So there's no escape from the fate that awaits
No one to witness the horror taking place
Yeah, now I'm on my way up the stairs
To the bedroom on my prey unaware
Heads will be hung from the chimney with care
With hopes that the police soon will be here
I'm a killer
Yo, yo
Fuck knocking, kick the door, evict the four
Yell out, "It's a stickup, hit the floor"
You fish cake niggas, stay Lipton off
Did your mama name you, or Mrs. Paul's
Battle in session, what's up with it?
I talk like I walk with a fucked up pivot
Niggas scream out, "It's just us bitches"
Don't shoot, out the phone booth
I aim at your party, hit the wrong group, "Happy birth"
Niggas done snap, runnin' hunch back
Ducking, brick walls, get thumbtacked
So run laps, for I body you
Bust out the size, like karate shoes, Doc
Turn Velcro, when night falls
Central park joggers, wear bright clothes
Tae Bo, five flo's lizard, centipede, snake
I'm a killer, I'm a killer
This is the sound of a cow
Yo, yo
I walk on backs like Mr. Bentley, after P P P strips you empty
Gather around, for rapid sound fourth of July was three months ago
Shoulda pad 'em down no one will fold both thumbs
And eight fingers to square with Joe Young
Tongue below one, spit dumb, moron
For white boys to snowboard on
So whatchu, whatchu, whatchu want?
Chew spearmint gum two double pump
Two cannons, piece by piece
Your school get dazed like G by G
Murda, murda, murda, kill, kill, kill
Take nuts and screws out ferris wheels
If you ain't Missy, payin' no bills
Body, you and supermarket, no thrills
Murda, murda, murda, kill, kill, kill
Murda, murda, murda, kill, kill, kill
Doc hold my coat, I'm 'bout to go low
Titanic MC rock the boat meth
Tone deaf rhyme, microphone sex line
Next time don't forget the TEC-9 step
Five digital, context is critical
Bomb threat these individuals thats on deck
So you the ill est nigga in Nebraska? Hell naw
It's the master, number sixteen, party crasher, Flex
I think too much, I drink too much
My crew don't really give two fucks, about you ducks
We over here Shaolin', what, spontaneous combust
When I smoke a bag of dust, what a rush, cigar be the dutch
Method Man and Redman, Starsky and Hutch
I crush MC's can't trust niggas, niggas can't trust me
I'm a killer
Cereal, cereal killer
Cereal, cereal killer
Cereal, cereal killer
Cereal, cereal killer
