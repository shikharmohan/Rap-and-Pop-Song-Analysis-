Once again
The mighty Death Row organization commitin' mass murder
And we ain't askin' for shit, nigga we takin' it
So Dre, blast they ass nigga
Rat-tat-tat-tat, late at night with my gat
On the streets of LA
Wonderin' where the pussy at
Staright for ya, looking for a hoe
Hangin' out, rollin' in my '64
16 switches for the niggaz in my hood
17 shells so I make it understood
Stay back, lay back, way back in the cut
Ya come outside nigga, ya gettin' fucked up
But I told ya, Creep, Creep, ya best move
Like Luthor Vadros, fuckin' up the west coast
I'm right back up in ya when ya nut
1-2-3 nut, from the D-R-E but
This is for the hoes that I used to know
When I didn't have my '64 and a lot of doe
I keep it like this and like that and I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
Rat-tat-tat-tat tat ta tat like that and I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
Rat-tat-tat-tat tat ta tat like that and I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
Oh, wait, that's that nigga that owe ya that grip
Ya, there that fool is, break him off proper then
What's up, what's happinin'? I'm the man
Nigga you delinquent, can I get those in?
Nigga, pay this Nigga here
I ain't got yo money
Well, yo, check this out, nigga
What's up? What's up? What's up?
Ya motherfucker
I'll be back though, I'll be back
Ya, you ain't never comin' back
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
Rat-tat-tat-tat tat ta tat like that, you know I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
Rat-tat-tat-tat tat ta tat like that and I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
Rat-tat-tat-tat tat ta tat like that, you know I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
Rat-tat-tat-tat tat ta tat like that and I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
Creepin' and peepin' and I can get with these
The chronic, slangin' fat keys from my block
And it don't stop, tell me where ya wanna go
To the strip or take a trip bawlin' with the row
My shit off in ya system attacks
Indo smoke do your lungs, like that
You can lift it, on and a fist a bomb
Takin' away like hell gone, Vietnam
California, back in and on a mission, provin' a point
In my game, ain't no fuckin' competition
They wishin' but run up on reality
CPT, CAL my locality
It's strange how I rearrange and change the business
By droppin' shit like this
Dope, niggas can't cope with the real
I peal, penatentaries steal when I kill it goes
Rat-tat-tat-tat like that and I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
Rat-tat-tat-tat like that, you know I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
Rat-tat-tat-tat like that and I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
Rat-tat-tat-tat like that, you know I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
Straight up, now you niggaz know where my homey's comin' from
So quit the chit-chat, before ya find yourself flat on your biz-out, fool
It's 9-duce, Dr Drizzay, is sittin' on Tizzart, it don't stop
Treartin' buster's just like a punk ass kizzart, biatch
