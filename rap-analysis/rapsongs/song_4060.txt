Yeah
My girl get in at 1:15 AM
The guitar's cryin' right now
Just a couple things goin' on in my life, you know
Brim leanin', cup tilted, blunt flickin'
Get money, fuck bitches
Young Weezy, young pimpin', she love it
I keep goin', she keep comin', what you know 'bout it?
So 'bout it like Master P but no coward
No I am, no Howard the duck duck
Lead showers, black flowers
Black dresses, two hours, closed casket
My dough tactics is so crafty
No laughter, I do that after I get the dough bastards
I get the dough faster, what if I flowed faster
Like oh Nancy, the flow's plastic, automatic, I'm
More drastic, ain't no names compared to me
Who are you? Where are ya? I can't see ya, answer me
Ya not there to me, I ain't fuckin' wit you bitch niggaz
I'm fuckin' ya sis nigga, it's Weezy
If you gon' call him Weezy
Then you must say the baby
If you don't say the baby
Then just don't say it at all
I'm slick as an old mac, I'm sick as a Prozac
And the Carter 1 was the dick for you hoes trapped
And this is tha Carter 2 and this is the bozack
Diggin' you hoes back, quick if I blow back
Got it, gone rabbit
Fast ma daddy's rabbit at home
What up pa, what up Pac, what up Pun
What up Big, what up Solja
As the streets get colder I get chillier
What up left eye, what up Aaliyah
Get Teck 9 close by touch 'em up
I shoot niggaz in the mouth boy pucker up
Sweet sucker tash gee golly what the fuck
Where the hell all these new pussy rappers come from
I chew 'em up like bubble gum, yum yum
Young Weezy so troublesome, what what
If you gon' call him Weezy
Then you must say the baby
If you don't say the baby
Then just don't say it at all
I ain't talkin' fast you just listenin' too slow
I'm gettin' them Benjamins, can serve like the Wimbledon
If I'm in any predicament, nervous never that
Got a gat to knock whoever back back, very flat
Chest caved in, mess on the pavement
Splat cherry wax, rahh, bury that
Rats scary cat, rat carry that
Holly grove trigga man guns in a knapsack
Area code five zero four, I ain't Nino fuckin' Brown
And this is tha Carter ho, this is a quarter stick
This in ya garter ho
Leave out the back and go straight to the corner store
Return with the cake, come wit all ma dough
And if not they find you in a lake in the mornin' ho
Weezy, baby please say the baby
If not, don't ya motherfuckin' say it at all, bitch
If you gon' call him Weezy
Then you must say the baby
If you don't say the baby
Then just don't say it at all
