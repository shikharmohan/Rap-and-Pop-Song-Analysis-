This ain't the huxtibles,
But we livin' comfortable,
And I don't make muy kids eat their vegetables,
The love of my life,
My wife Shante,
Little do she know,
She da boss Lay-day,
My youngest duaghter Cori,
That's another Story,
I call he choc,
Cuase she rule the clock,
My son Cordell,
I call him rook,
He like Lizards and money,
Boy he off da hook,
 
My man Corde,
He da quaterback,
he my oldest son.
Is we holly wood,
Yea we might as should!
 Now you About Snoop Dodds father hood
