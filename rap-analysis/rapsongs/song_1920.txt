DMX, Bzr Royale, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm tired of answerin' for s*** in my life
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
Tired of answerin' for s*** that I do
Enough about me, man, what the *** about you?
Dreamin', starvin', drinkin', smokin'
Wishin', hopin', nympho scopin'
Hater prayin' for the day man
What I'm sayin's hard not playin'
Still the world is [Incomprehensible]
Say them things, for days it's rainin'
And it's always rainin' and it's always some'n
I'ma keep on comin', I'ma keep on comin'
So butterflies can't reach my stomach
To get my heartbeat jumpin' and my blood flow pumpin'
So my life means some'n and it ain't no frontin'
For the respect you get for the work in the climbin'
For the ways that's beside me and the n*** that don't like me
Got a p*** and my iron if you wanna get to firin'
We can all keep the violence, we can all get the iron
It's all about the timin' if you wanna get the hype in early
I'm tired of answerin' for s*** in my life
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
Tired of answerin' for s*** that I do
Enough about me, man, what the *** about you?
Top dog, cat's don't know
Can't *** with the flow from Y.O.
Ridin' too much ***, say it ain't so
I'm 'bout to let the dog blow, yo
Get the *** out the way or get bit
I ain't with the industry ***
'Cause this is what you'll get
Stomped the *** out or, shut the *** up and
Put cats down never, got the *** up and
What the *** up? I'm tired of talkin'
I'm about to let my finger do the walkin'
Before we outlined in chalk in the middle of the street
Just start to feelin' a little bit of heat
Don't let the steel in the street that you know go to your head
*** around you gon' wake up dead
I ain't playin' wit'chu ***, I got 20 years in it
But I realize, it only takes a minute to end it
I'm tired of answerin' for s*** in my life
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
Tired of answerin' for s*** that I do
Enough about me, man, what the *** about you?
It's Bzr Royale, come do it live
Mama say, mama sah, mama macusa
We in [Incomprehensible] probably they know why
Not tryin' to be funny, my time is money
See often runnin', we out the gate
My horse is gunnin', we winnin' this race
It's bloodline ***, it's no time ***
For *** to fool my ***
Drinkin' daily, old ceiling leakin'
Men *** tense, still smokin', drinkin'
Hammers ready for them billings
Tryna creep up in my building
Drunk***, what's the matter with your mind?
Learn how to live or you learn how to die
Kill a killa, be a killa, that's what's really hood
That's what's really good, wish a *** would
I'm tired of answerin' for s*** in my life
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
Tired of answerin' for s*** that I do
Enough about me, man, what the *** about you?
