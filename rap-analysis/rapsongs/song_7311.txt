Living,
Just ain't what it was in the beginning,
And if you love me, you could feel what I'm feeling,
Filled with agony, and misery, but I'm dealing,
And somehow rebuilding, 
(Yeah)
What work for me, don't work for you,
What bring joy to me, bring hurt to you,
What's best for me, ain't best for you,
So it's all that I, have left to do,
And I know you think, I'm selfish too.
Sooo...
Alone I stand in the dark, right behind this microphone,
Tried to pick up all the pieces to my broken heart, to decide what's right and wrong,
When the people that you love are gone, when this house is just not a home,
I know that I ain't gunna be happy with nobody else, I'd rather live my life alone,
I guess I live my life alone,
Leaving,
Makes more sense than fighting every evening,
All these arguments about nothing, yelling and screaming,
And you would rather be without me, or so it's seeming,
Or am I dreaming?
What work for me, don't work for you,
What bring joy to me, bring hurt to you,
What's best for me, ain't best for you,
So it's all that I, have left to do,
And I know you think, I'm selfish too.
Sooo...
Alone I stand in the dark, right behind this microphone,
Tried to pick up all the pieces to my broken heart, to decide what's right and wrong,
When the people that you love are gone, when this house is just not a home,
I know that I ain't gunna be happy with nobody else, I'd rather live my life alone,
I guess I live my life alone,
Born alone,
Life live, die alone,
Fall in love, break-up cry alone,
I lie alone,
In bed by myself,
I might as well,
Break up outta here,
Invite her here,
Blank out kill the bitch,
And go to jail,
I don't give a shit,
This empty house, I can't live in it,
So I put you out my misery,
This how I feel, until she right here with me,
And then I tell her, look at what you did to me,
Get down and beg her, to stay right here with me,
Because the pain too severe for me,
I said the pains too severe for me.
Alone I stand in the dark, right behind this microphone,
Tried to pick up all the pieces to my broken heart, to decide what's right and wrong,
When the people that you love are gone, when this house is just not a home,
I know that I ain't gunna be happy with nobody else, I'd rather live my life alone,
I guess I live my life alone.
