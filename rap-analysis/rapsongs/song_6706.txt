You're back now at the jack-off hour this is DJ, Eazy Dick
On W-Balls, right now, somethin' new by Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one goes out to the ladies, from all the guys
A big bow wow wow 'cause we gonna make it a little mystery
Here tonight, this is DJ Eazy Dick on the station that
Slaps you across your fat ass with a fat dick
When I met you last night baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had a respect for ya lady
But now I take it all back
'Cause you gave me all your pussy
And you even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give you a call
Next time I'm feelin' kinda horny
You can come on over and I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck that day, baby
Just lay back and open your mouth
'Cause I have never met a girl
That I love in the whole wide world
Well, if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch, I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfuckin' endo to smoke
I gets loced and looney, bitch, you can't Do Me
Do we like BBD, you hoochie groupie?
I have no love for hoes
That's somethin' I learned in the pound
So how the fuck am I supposed
To pay this hoe? Just to lay this hoe
I know the pussy's mines, I'ma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it, there's nothin' else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
'Cause she ain't nuthin' but a bitch to me
And y'all know that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention?
Approach it with a different proposition, I'm Kurupt
Hoe, you'll never be my only one, trick ass beeeitch
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
Guess who back in the motherfuckin' house
With a fat dick for your motherfuckin' mouth?
Hoes recognize, niggaz do too
'Cause when bitches get skanless and pull a voodoo
What you gon' do? You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that hoe
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowin' damn well, I'm too caught up with my grip
Now, as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga
Named Snoop Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see, it ain't no fun, if my homies can't get a taste of it
'Cause you know I don't love 'em
Whoa, hey, now ya know, inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, six-fo' Rad to be exact
With bitches on my side and bitches on back
So back up bitch because I'm strugglin'
Just get off your knees and then start jugglin'
These motherfuckin' nuts in your mouth
It's me, Warren G the nigga with the clout, whoo
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
Fun
