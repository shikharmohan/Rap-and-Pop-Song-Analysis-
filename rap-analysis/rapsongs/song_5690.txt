Bright moments
Bright moments always come back vivid
The fifth great was epic citywide test pressure
The pre-crack era
Mr Schollmen, what a prick
Attitude matches wardrobe, uglier than sin
This is Bed-Stuy '82
Ninth floor, three tiny rooms, one view
Buck-town, Roosevelt house
They green grass is green, our green grass is brown
Shots rang, my phone wasn't touchtone
A heavy beef in the street, ET had to flee
Gray heavens, good grief
Hungry bellies, bright gold on they teeth
The windows on the Ave look like sad eyes
They fix their sharp gaze on you when you pass by
And if you dare to stand, you can see 'em cry
You can watch 'em scowl, feel 'em prowl
Wall and study every inch about you
Fast math measuring what you amount to
The laughter, the screams
The numeral, the song of psalms, the book of dreams
Ends don't meet where the arms can't reach mean streets
Even when it's free it ain't cheap
On going saga, terminal diagnosis
Basic survival requires super heroics
No space in the budget for a cake
It's when you gotta fly by night to save the day
Crash landings routinely happen
Some survive, others never rise from the ashes
Watching asphalt and observing the Sabbath
Creates an ecstatic and there you have it
From teenage love praying in tongue
Strange fruit, batty boots and native drums
From hence I come, so here we go
Signs and wonders all along the road
Some lies open, some lies close
Some stretchers role with no lies at all
Some riders don't know what they riding for
Hands on the wheel and their mind is gone
Wherever you ride, whatever your name
This raw cold life is a beautiful thing
And we are alive in amazing times
Delicate hearts, diabolical minds
Revelations, hatred, love and war
And more and more and more and more
And more of less than ever before
It's just too much more for your mind to absorb
It's scary like hell but there's no doubt
We can't be alive in no time but now
It's just a sure shot to the heart
It's just a sure shot in the dark
It's just another place in the star
[Incomprehensible]
Life in marvelous time, life in marvelous time
Right, everywhere all over the world
You can feel it, all over the world
Feel it, feel it rise everywhere
It's just a sure shot to the heart
It's just a sure shot in the dark
It's just another place in the star
[Incomprehensible]
Life in marvelous time, life in marvelous time
Now
