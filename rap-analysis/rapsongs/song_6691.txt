If I didn't have no dough, would U love me?
If we didn't have a place to go, would U still be there?
Would U leave me alone if the chips were down?
Would U stay around and be down? Oh girl
I gotta have a chick like U
I gotta have a girl like U
I gotta have a chick like U
I gotta have a girl like U
Hey yo Dunc, who dat girl standing there like dat?
Lookin' from the front but I can see what's in da back
Hips like O, thighs like O
Pretty toes in a row, they lookin' like OO
I don't know nephew, let's do what we do
Let's just slide up on these hoes and put this pimpin' to use
And then what what we do, what we do
You take the one in the white, I'll take the one in the blue
If I didn't have no dough, would U love me?
If we didn't have a place to go, would U still be there?
Would U leave me alone if the chips are down?
Would U stay around and be down? Oh girl
I gotta have a chick like U
I gotta have a girl like U
I gotta have a chick like U
I gotta have a girl like U
I don't know if U been told
But U look like U should be gold
You're so precious, the way U shape up
I'm just here to help U step your game up
You look like a dime right from here
You can dive in half of the bullet and die for me
'Cos you can fly, you be fly, you can fly with me
And when I fly another country, you can fly with me
If I didn't have no dough, would U love me?
If we didn't have a place to go, would U still be there?
Would U leave me alone if the chips were down?
Would U stay around and be down? Oh girl
I gotta have a chick like U
I gotta have a girl like U
I gotta have a chick like U
I gotta have a girl like U
Now as the night winds down and the weed gets low
Players still playin' an' I'm still on the flow
I grove to the beat till my feet get tired
I just want to be your desire
Eva Keneva best believer
You not a dime peice you a diva
Take it from me you can be the
O N E, if you roll with me
Now if looks was a case, baby gurl wud be federal
The top half incredible, bottom half edable
I ain't tellin' you what I heard man, I'm tellin' you what I know
An' I ain't tellin' her where to stay an' where to go
An if she want we can take a trip down
With the hommie D O double G
An he from Longbeach, I'm from a little town
An' it's low key, guess who where tha crown
If I didn't have no dough, would U love me?
If we didn't have a place to go, would U still be there?
Would U leave me alone if the chips are down?
Would U stay around and be down? Oh girl
I gotta have a chick like U
I gotta have a girl like U
I gotta have a chick like U
I gotta have a girl like U

Everybody clap your hands
If you came to party with tha D O double G an'
