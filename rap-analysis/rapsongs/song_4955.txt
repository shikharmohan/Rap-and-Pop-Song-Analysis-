Simply marvelous  that's what you are, that's what you are, that's what you are
More than outrageous, ooh ooh, that's what you are
Beyond incredible  that's what you are (yeah yeah) that's what you are, that's what you are
Now that's contagious (ooh ooh) ooohhh, that's what you are, (Luda) hey
Ludacris (verse 1)
I must admit that you are truly sumpthin' special
So hop up in my vessel, let's wrestle like I'm The Rock (Rock)
Deep in your ocean I'ma find your buried treasure
So hop up on the dresser throw your legs up to the top (top)
Stretch it out like calisthenics, better that Luda wet it and get it
And have somebody call the medic (Medic !!!)
My head is in the right direction, my quarter's in your jukebox
Girl, you are my number one selection
I'll play you over and over, put your head on my shoulder
Slide down and give me head in the Rover (Rover)
And I'm a soldier, see it ain't no limits to the things we could do
And I made this record for you'z, and'a we can break it down
To the nitty gritty one time, and when it comes to the sexin'
I get busy with mine, do you get busy with yerrz?
I guess we destined to see, baby girl you a destine to be

Ludacris (verse 2)
So supernatural, wonderful and miraculous
You got me buggin' off your attractiveness like whoa! (whoa!)
So precise, so fine in your position that my unanimous decision
Is to never say no (no), You got me strung like a guitar,
Playin' the sweetest melody, is definitely heavenly by far (far)
Further than the moon, and I never fake it, but I take it
When you get naked cuz your body's like boom (boom!)
How could I resist it, I'll be there in a instant
When you call, like tornadoes you got me twisted
I know you missed it, so I'ma give it good
You'll go ballistic, because I give it hood
Just like a nigga would, and like a nigga should
If you hear screamin' then Luda's up in your neighborhood
Good gracious, yeah I do it right, and all night you areÃ¢Â¦ (back to hook)
Bridge
It's courageous how you drop the phone and rush over
Crazy how you make me high when I'm sober
Just when I thought, I've seen it all, you put it down on me (ooh, ooh, ooh)
It's contagious how your lips make me lose composure
Addicted to the kisses your blow got me swole up
There's only one my champion That's what you are to meÃ¢Â¦
