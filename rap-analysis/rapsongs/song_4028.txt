When i got here i did the same,
I Don't like beer i like champagne,
So cheers to Lil Wayne,
And if she think she get my number,
just hope my number don't change,
Girl stop playing i got that p-ssy on a string,
Now let's do it!

And do it and do it and do it, do it, do it
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it,

Weezy F I'm bad as luck,
I'm already at the top bout to pull the ladder up,
GO crazy, I need a counselor,
I'm hip hops announcer,
I'm in the gun club,

now I rock and still-I-jam,
few n-ggas wit me got that white girl like Will-I-am,
look up b-tch aint no ceilings,
see me at the top controlling things,
anybody beat its a muthaf-cking murder scene,
I do it,
