This is little Kane though
His little sobrero, huh
Aiyo, aiyo
Aiyo, butter pecan Rican, love a little candy girl
Caramel cover girl, love the way your body twirl
French vanilla cream, body work is mean
Chocolate fudge make a nigga wanna fall in love
You got them fat legs, killin' them Gucci's
Heels on with your fat coochie
The way ya spillin', you seducin' me
Take time, create, yeah, my legend is straight now
Your inner vibe's the side of the juicy
Cheeba queen, [Incomprehensible] jeans, state to state
An' she got the nerve to fuck me all mean
While I rock all green by all means
We in the mall fiendin', one more hump then I'ma scream
Boo, throw me more of you, I'll take all four of you
We could flip it on the floor while I'm pourin' on you
Make me kiss it in the store on you
Cop the new drawers, the dick is all yours
It's a mornin' blue
Straight mines, that's a warnin', duke
Watch me climb, that pussy looks shaped an' designed
Line for line, rhyme for rhyme
That coochie is mine, I might just eat it this time
Aiyo, butter pecan Rican, love a little candy girl
Caramel cover girl, love the way your body twirl
French vanilla cream, body work is mean
Chocolate fudge make a nigga wanna fall in love
Aiyo, butter pecan Rican, love a little candy girl
Caramel cover girl, love the way your body twirl
French vanilla cream, body work is mean

Shut the fuck up an' get in the car
Girl, your high beams is on
I wonder how they fit in that bra
We in the front seat, splittin' cigars, I'm on my job
So you handcuffin' ho' ass niggaz, be on your guard
Especially on ladies night, I like it when they take a swallow
Straight out the bottle, but that ain't lady-like
I call 'em lil' pet names like 'Ma' an' 'Boo boo'
So every time I see your girlfriend, never confuse you
With the next down-ass chick that play a part
That's cool enough to pardon my French, 'Menage a trois'
Meth Man, real talk, don't mean to put you on the spot
But I know a spot to kick your heels off
I'm not as Dirty as that bastard be
But still a villain, I serve 'em Dick Dastardly
Here's a little taste of 'Ice Cream 2'
So put some Vicky Secret on, trick, I might swing through
Aiyo, butter pecan Rican, love a little candy girl
Caramel cover girl, love the way your body twirl
French vanilla cream, body work is mean
Chocolate fudge make a nigga wanna fall in love
Aiyo, butter pecan Rican, love a little candy girl

Yo, I love my dick size, like I love women an' shit
My head grew over these years, now I got a nice dick
Beauty mark right on my balls, girl, have a nice lick
Cute in the face, hair-do, you got some nice lips
Pussy monkeys holdin' my cock, just like it's vice grips
Part down the crack of your ass, your frame is priceless
Butter, butter caramel swirl, chocolate chip
French vanilla sundae girls, banana split
Cum drip down in your chin, right on your soft tits
Put your hand gently in mine, give me a soft kiss
What's really good? Girl, slip me your number
You blowin' up an' you're lookin' 'Ice Cream' this summer
Better than Beyonce, Halle Berry an' them
Honey, you lookin' scrumptous, I ain't worried 'bout them
You my straight hood chick, girl, you more than a gym
You got that fat tight pussy like Notorious Kim
Aiyo, butter pecan Rican, love a little candy girl
Caramel cover girl, love the way your body twirl
French vanilla cream, body work is mean
Chocolate fudge make a nigga wanna fall in love
