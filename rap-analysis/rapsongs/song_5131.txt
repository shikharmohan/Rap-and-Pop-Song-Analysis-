Yo who is it? 
Yo lyte it's epic, you got time to chill? 
Nah umm, sorry I ain't got no time to chill
But I got umm..
Skins, skins, every now and then
I meet a peter with a pecker that tries to be in
Because my tongue is the mind of a readywriter
Like chuck d said, I'm a rhyme fighter
No there is no other, because I'm smooth like butter
Or should I say parkay, butter - parkay
Butter - parkay, fuck it anyway
Yo, you get the rhythm (what the rhythm? ) that I'm promotin
And if not, I say it in slow motion
L.... y.... yeah.... t.... e....
Uhh! ("there it is")
