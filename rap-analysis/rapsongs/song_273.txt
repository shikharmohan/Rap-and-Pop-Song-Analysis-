Wag Your Tail
Yeah can I have a big bimbo box meal hold the bimbo sauce
two super sized freaky fries and a make me shiver shake
(I know who this isÃÂ¢€ÃÂ¦how you doing?)
I'm doing good sweetheart how are you?
(I'm O.K. anyway drive around to the 2nd window please)
Baby remember how you were as a child Everything was up and nothing down
Every day was hopes and dreams no fears Whatever happened to those years?
Let's Rent a Private Jet and Escape
Fly To Paris Walk on Champs-ElysÃÃÂ©es
Let's Live Your Dreams
Wag Your Tail for Me
I Cannot Read Your Mind
When You're happy Baby Show Me a Sign
Just Let Me See
You Wag Your Tail for Me
Baby don't depend on what you see
Everything's perception not reality
Life has thrown some curves but we'll throw them back
Straighten out what's wrong and get back on track
I called your boss on the telephone
And said my babies flying off to Rome
Let Wendy take the register
And let Cindy sweep the floors and 
Let Joe and dem close the store 
my baby needs a dream and I'm taking her
wherever seems to make her happy!
Baby baby you can live your dreams
Let's not settle for anything
You deserve the best of things
Honey child let's go ride in the car
And we'll fly as far as our minds can conceive
Let's rent a private jet and escape
Fly To Paris walk on Champs-ElysÃÃÂ©es
Let's live your dreams
Wag your tail for me
I cannot read your mind
When you're happy baby show me a sign
Just let me see
you wag your tail for me
If you're happy show me a sign
Wag your tail for me
Reality is meant to defy
wag your tail for me
baby darlin you are so alive
so am I so let's fly the sky
