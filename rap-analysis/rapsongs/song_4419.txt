Lousianimal, I'm an animal..
(I Got emmm)
Call me Lil Weezy and the Carter,
I go harder,
All about a dolla,

bitch i pour syrup in that vitamin water,
I hope you die ugly and tonight be georgous,
feed me your organs, 
bitch im starving,
tear drops on my face like its my party,
and if its my party, i can cry if i want to,
split your fucking body up in half like 1-2,
bitch im from New Orleans,
reportin everywhere,
and i have a dream to be your worst nightmare,
I'm in the Kings chair,
watching Sportscenter,
and I cut on BET, Eye dinner.
Throw your ass up,

and we hungry so please come with a chip on your shoulder,
and we got dem guns that gotta sit on your shoulder,
I rock Ice but my heart colder,
Lousianimal, I'm an Animal.
