(Luda)
How low can you go?(x8)
(Squeaky Voice)
How low can you go?(x8)
Hahaha Luda!
(Luda) [Verse 1]
She can go lower than I ever really thought she could
Face down, ass up
The top of yo booty jigglin' out yo'jeans
Baby pull yo'pants up
I like it when I see you do it
Better than I ever seen it done before
A lot of women drop it to the ground
BUT, how low can you go
Lower than yo' mamas ever seen it in her lifetime
Never would of imagined it
Not even in her right mind
Practice in front of that mirror
Now you doin' it on the dance floor
Mad 'cuz I can't get with you
Just show me how to dance (OOOH)
I may not want to get low 
Ao I'm post it up kinda like a playa do
But if you come to the crib then 
I might show you girls a thang or 2
Yeah I think you a superstar
With a ass like that you gotta blew
Before you make it big there's just one thing that I gotta know
[Chorus]
(Squeaky Voice)
How low can you go?(x8)
(Shawnna)
I could go low, (go low) lower than you know,
Go low,(go low) lower than you know,
Go low,(go low) lower than you know,
Go low,(go low) lower than you know,
Go low,(go low) lower than you know,
(Luda) [Verse 2]
I be like knick knack paddy wack
Oh where my kitty cat give a dog a bone
How many licks does it take 'till I get to the center 
And let a reala nigga take you home
I can make this show stop
As soon as you hear this flow pop
From A-T-L-A-N-T-A and all the way to yo' drop
Put the needle on the record 
And I make her get lower than a Lamborghini
And if she really get low, 
Then I'mma shoot a video and put it all on T.V.
'Cuz I like that French vanilla and the Caramel
BUT, when it comes to chocolate
I know that very well
Asian persuasion all the discrimination
I love how they seem to please us
I wanna taste them butterrican peacans 
Peanut butterscups like Reese's Pieces
'Cuz I think you a superstar
With a ass like that you gotta blew
Before you make it big well there's just one thing that I gotta know
[Chorus]
(Luda) [Verse 3]
Drop it, hit it, dump it, split it
Don't stop (get it get it)
Put it in reverse just to back it up
Let me put some Luda in it
Show me what you working with
I'll show you some of this bank roll
Yeah you a superstar
There's just a thing I gotta know 
So
[Chorus]
