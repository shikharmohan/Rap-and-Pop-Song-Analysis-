We'd like to welcome y'all to the fabulous Carolina West
I own this motherfucker and my name is Taa-Dow
Y'all niggaz know who I am y'all niggaz tearin'  up shit
But we got somethin' old, and somethin' new for y'all tonight
Put your hands together for Snoop Doggy Dogg
The Dogg Pound, and the fabulous Dramatics
It's like everywhere I look, and everywhere I go
I'm hearin' motherfuckers tryin' to steal my flow
But it ain't no thang 'cause see my nigga Coolio
Put me up on the game when I step through the do'
Ya know, some of these niggaz is so deceptive
Usin' my styles like a contraceptive
I hope ya get burnt, it seems ya haven't learnt
It's the nick nack patty wack, I still got the bigger sack
So put your gun away, run away, 'cuz I'm back
Hit 'em up, get 'em up, spit 'em up, now tell me what's goin' on
It make me wanna holler, 'cuz my dollars come in ozones
Lone for the break-up, so take off your clothes
And quit tryin' to spit at my motherfuckin' hoes
Speakin' of hoes, I'll get to the point
You think you got the bomb 'cuz I rolled you a joint
You'se a flea and I'm the big Dogg
I'll scratch you off my balls with my motherfuckin' paws
Y'alls, niggaz, better recognize and see where I'm comin' from
It's still East Side till I die, why ask why?
As the world keeps spinning to the D O Double G Y
It's a crazy mixed up world
It's a Doggy Dogg World
It's a Doggy Dogg World
It's a Doggy Dogg World
The Dogg's World
Well if you give me ten bitches then I'll fuck all ten
See my homey Snoop Doggy sippin' juice and gin
Don't slip, I'm fo' to set trip, to get papers
Styles vary, packin' flavor like Life Savors
Ain't that somethin', talk shit and I'm dumpin'
I had your whole fuckin' block bumpin'
Don't sweat, but check the technique, I'm unique like China
Ya never find the bomb-a-rama then this nigga behind ya
So peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm coming through
One-two, three, you can't see me
I'm a G like that strapped with hit hard tactics
A fuckin' menace, usin' hoes like tennis rackets
It's on again, it's on and poppin'
All I see is green, so there ain't no stoppin'
I wanna see some panties droppin'
I'm comin' from L.A., she used to chill with Dre up in Compton
All I ever did was just use that hoe
Show her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows
I'm dishin' out blues, I'm upsetting like bad news
Cut off khakis, French braids, and house shoes
Kurupt, the name's often marked for catchin' slugs
And I smoke weed for the fuck of it
Ruff and rugged shit, it's unexplanitory how I gets wicked
But it's mandatory that I kick it
Check it, I'm runnin' hoes in 94, now must I prove it
Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be stickin' and movin'
Prepare for a war, it's on, I'm head huntin'
Hit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn
Peep, the massacre from a verbal assassin
Murderin' with rhymes packin' Tec-9's for some action
You really don't know, do you, you fuckin' wit a hog
You can't do me, I'm goin' out loony like O-Dog
It's a Doggy Dogg's World
The Dogg's World
Tha Dogg Pound rocks the party uh huh
Tell when it don't stop, and uh, it don't quit for the
The Dogg Pound clique to drop the cavvy Dogg shit
Diggity Daz out of the motherfuckin' cut once mo'
So grab a seat and grab your gin and juice and check out the flow
I flip flop and serve hoes with a fat dick
Till I die I'm still screamin' that
Now I'm the mack daddy, had he, not known about
The city where I'm from, dum diddy dum
As you groove to the gangster shit
The D O Double G the P O U N D, the gangsta clique
Now as the Pound break it down with the gangsta funk
I can see and I can tell that's what the fuck you want
So I blaze up the chronic, so I can get high
I promise I'll smoke chronic till the day that I die
It's a Doggy Dogg World
The Dogg's World
It's a Doggy Dogg World
The Dogg's World
It's a Doggy Dogg World
The Dogg's World
It's a Doggy Dogg World
The Dogg's World
