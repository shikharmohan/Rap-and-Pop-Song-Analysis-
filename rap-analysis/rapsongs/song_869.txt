Floss time, Busta Rhymes shine on every primetime
Mastermind gettin' this paper now cross the fine line
Money plenty sippin' gently with the Bentley
My Bentley runneth over empty what gifts you sent me
Then you broke the last rule, frontin' like we was mad cool
You damn fool, come around frontin' wearin' your man's jewels
Play the part, they want me to start shit
Get on your mark quick and target, corner the market
Peep how we're movin' this, keep improvin' this
See you in this because you love the way me and my crew be doin' this
Have a ball, I'm not mad at ch'all, where the alcohol
I ain't messin' with you at all, girl your ass too small
Cop the hot shit, write it off while you bite it off
And try to fight it off, you're forgot you wack and your light is off
Bite the dust, you like to fuss, look right at us
I know you like to cuss, who could you trust to bring the rush?
Now do the
Yo bus a bus

Turn it off, turn back me on go get your mack on
And keep the track goin' and latch on hope you can catch on
Follow the beat you sweet bitches and get your dance on
Tipsy off a little cristi' a little dom
Barbeque back at the mansion, feel like a champion
Collapse on, my thing orthopedic to rest your back on
Nowadays flip mode money be runnin' mad north
Fuck around, dig in my treasure, feel my forty-five long
Ride through, about to slide through, I'm right beside you
Mind you, my system be bangin', adjust my EQ
Peek a boo, we not seekin' you, focus on being you
There's only one of me, 'cause you copy, there might be three of you
Classic and so essential, we monumental
Powerful, we predisential, we bomb your mental
Bite the dust, you like to fuss, look right at us
I know you like to cuss, who could you trust to bring the rush?

Yo bus a bus

Hit me off, you speak an' spell and freak it well
So no need to dwell, check in the mirror, my pockets swell
Shit sound so intermediate, my ingredient
Is to immediately rep for everyone you see me with
You little eedyot, I exile you and your X file
You and your next trial, and demolish your little Rap style
Black child, I'm takin' offensive, we too impressive
To the naked eye, the way we floss sure be expensive
Ooh! Run up the fader, ain't nuttin' greater
Still a little hater be gettin' paper go meet your maker
Undertaker now go shake whatcha momma gave ya
Shake a shake a now we trippin' the circuit breaker
Model up and swallow up and turn the throttle up
Break the bottle up in the hip with the greatest follow up
Bite the dust, you like to fuss, look right at us
I know you like to cuss, who could you trust to bring the rush?
Now do the
Yo bus a bus
(A c'mon, just keep it movin')
Yo bus a bus
