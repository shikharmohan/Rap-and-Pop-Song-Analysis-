Cover your dome or feel the motherfuckin' glock
The problem child is in the house, I'm lettin' off shots
Biggedy bang, biggedy bang, hit them motherfuckers dead
I'm down on this track and I'm about to get wreck
I'm comin' like a hustla never comin' busta
Blastin' around you hoes screamin', "Die motherfucka"
Never showin' mercy 'cause that shit is for the weak
I [unverified] put my glock and knock that nigga off his feet
A young nigga judge says, "I'm bigger"
Step up with that bullshit and I'm a greet you with this trigger
Blastin' all you hoes to let you know how it feels
Fuckin' with the 5th ward psycho get your fuckin' dome peeled
Motherfucker bring it on
It's the Seagster, the major leagesta
Bitch deceiver, nigga, life reliever
Oakland hustler, never been a buster
Make way for the nine try, I'm comin' motherfucker
Straight from the 6-9, the final line village
Doin' more damage than an Exxon spillage
Uh, coward and that's that
I'm known to pack a gat and put heads on flap
No rehabilitating my trigger
Take a nigga out the ghetto
But you can't take the ghetto out the nigga
Ain't nothin' changed since the 70's
I'm hell bound bitch my life ain't never been heavenly
Never slippin' porno, a nigga don't laugh
Game tight replace a niggas nights with a toe tag
Fazoo his ass and a zigga I'm the founder
Stackin' up bodies like Jeffery Dahlmer
Oh, here comes the flow
Watch me as I tip toe to a niggas window with my M-60
Puttin' motherfuckers out they misery
And watchin' the murders
Reenacted on 'Unsolved Mysteries'
Trick, coward ass pussy, ass faggot
Six feet deep is where you sleep with
The worms and the maggots
Nigga can't harm me
Rap-A-Lot army comin' like Desert Storm
You've been warned but if you still want
Some nigga bring it on
Band-aid bandit of too much trouble
