Rock you, rock you
Rock you, rock you
Rock you, rock you
Come on, come on
Aiyyo y'all rappers less play, what I'm about to say
Will probably hit y'all niggas in a real strange way
Shmucks, ducks and half hearted prankster crews
Willie dank Langston Hughes, put shanks in crews
I debut to make the news and I've been killing it since
Still in the trench, buzzin' off the killin' dispense
I want my niggas out that barbwire still in the fence
Verbal assassin I'm a killer still in a sense
Rhymes is graphic
Aimin' straight at your minds and blast that weak shit
The pieces and particles of fragments mad vocabulist
Yes, I must confess
I'm like Diddy tryin' to sink a slug in Elliots chest
Just taste on that it's Black you can tally up that
You never knew that fate cut you until your belly was wet
New Delian cat the Fraggle Rock skully is split it's Black comin'
You can tell it's a hit, comin' to drop you nigga
We will rock you
We will rock you
We will rock you
Yo yall savages is primitive, I'm true penmanship
Here come the neuro-linguistic rhyme hypnotist
Making sound waves, prisoners outta the listeners
Legendary magnificent Pope distributors
Man I remain miles ahead of the game
Slang play off the meter 'cause it's never the same
Niggas tell me how they never comin' better then frame
They love what I say
Here come the rebel breaking the frame and it's all true
My earning bars arts is martial
I'm comin' to off you, I ain't tryin' to argue
When you least expect it I'm gonna step out the darkroom
Pull out the hardware tools the particles will spark you
My niggas wraps give a slice
I spit nice fucking around this twice
As much as rhythm is rolling a dice
To choose one, the noose or the gun
'Cause you're getting banged or hanged
Thought second to none nigga
We will rock you
We will rock you
We will rock you
Yo check it out whether you ballin'
Or just one the wall and groovin', groovin'
We've come to get it kickin' and get the movement movin'
For Tracey and Tamika and for Shelly and Susan
Styles make you wonder what the hell he was usin'
Remember your development with out any music
Spit so many spears it's becoming a nuisance to some
But to whoever want to know who the truth is
You never heard another on the mic as ruthless
I drink a little liquor a lot of water and juices
It make money ain't no need for makin' excuses
Burn you fuckin' with a South Philly exclusive
Them long dick niggas with real short fuses that go off
Chick likes Riq, you such a show off
You cut your locks down to a fro than cut your fro off
I been at your show there ain't no way to cut your flow off
You got to be the illest emcee that people know of word
I will rock you
I will rock you
I will rock you
