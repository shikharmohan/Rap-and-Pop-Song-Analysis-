Remember the days when I was walking and talking
Doing what I gotta do, doing what we wanna do
Off into my walked dawn missions, why?
'Cos the brothers that I knew with the rise drove by
Only nice in the days looking down the road
Seeing beautiful girls with the car load
Yeah, yeah, yeah they are screaming
Wish I had a little ride on my own
But since I don't there is my sobb story
My missions will continue as I keep on stalking
Stamina was dying from the constant walking
Right before the moment I began to car to my man ridle
Who had a some moving on I thought he wouldn't know
That's my dying where are the others nammy you beat
And kept driven now in my heart they do a big hole
'Cos my little, little, little toes started jumping on my end soul
It was frigidity burn and then I said wait, I got pride
It's time to get my own ride
I came up with the scheme and got paid
I had no other choice but go at knowledge of tray
When I got my transport, I got kind of steam g up
'Cos I got cherry pet further
Now I'm feeling good 'cos I'm off my feet
Man the little squalid dogs running up in the street
And they saying
My name is Sharina, my name is Busta
My name is Tonia, my name is Busta
My name is Dianna, my is Busta
And what do you take me for the little loco push over
No shame in my game 'cos that's how I got this
And when I return the playback everybody gets pist
And now I am the man fielding all the glory
And when you rise down and gone, just remember that
I know you and you know me
I know you and you know me
I know you and you know me
It's the sobb story, the sobb story
I know you and you know me
I know you and you know me
I know you and you know me
It's the sobb story, the sobb story
Red like green like 1, 2, 3
Here comes the hop along kid Charlie B
I'm constantly moving with my walkman kicking
My bunions are crying beaving plicking
Please, please, get into the vehicle
I stop at Dave's ave
Figure out vehicle brother to give me a ride
Sorry, Charlie was a coming reply
I didn't forget about the girl in the sidekick
The rubber don't system in the swallow kid
C drive by with the posse, ooh ah, ooh ah, ooh ah
Hey Charlie Brown, where you go?
Well, I have to purchase to get
Smoke from the rubber word up to my neck
Girls wear Cochise's and their friends way fendy
Wall ally a walker to get fairly
Just a beep beep an occasional way
The table's turn, now she got play
Lunchtime Marty and Deon
Johny Guills, Diego Stroy, and Dacon
Sitting and waiting for about to biggy these
I stack by the crackerjacks just through delieve
Stress it's a mess I decided to work
But it's hard to work when your boss is a jerk
I sweat floors and drive to get mine
My amigos with Dinco D, Milo and Busta rhymes
Wreck top kick box Galooine Brown who's the clown
Remember the
I know you and you know me
I know you and you know me
I know you and you know me
It's the sobb story, the sobb story
I know you and you know me
I know you and you know me
I know you and you know me
It's the sobb story, the sobb story
Now I remember rod when he first got his sobb
Didn't have a job and his car was a mob more brothers
He never knew from jack and when his car win flact
They wouldn't inject
And when his car was in the shop they wouldn't stop buy
They've say hi on the reply but back came rob
To the same old game
Hee hee yo, what's up to y'all, wanna hang?
Yeah sure they said on the quick fast
By the way anybody got money for gass?
Nah, not me I don't, don't ask
I got it, come on watch out, we gonna crash!
Roll away now rob just walking like me
The D to the O and the Middle Inc.
And some say MV I say all empty
And now he just walking my sobb story
I know you and you know me
I know you and you know me
I know you and you know me
It's the sobb story, the sobb story
I know you and you know me
I know you and you know me
I know you and you know me
It's the sobb story, the sobb story
