[Bon Iver]
I shoot the lights out
Hide til its bright out
Whoa, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?
[Rick Ross]
Bitch I'm a monster no good blood sucker
fat muthaf-cker now look who's in trouble
as you run through my jungle all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West sample, here's one for example
[Kanye West - Chorus]
Gossip gossip
n-ggas just stop it
everybody know (I'm a muthaf-cking monster)
I'ma need to see your f-cking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your f-cking hands at the concert
profit profit, n-gga I got it
everybody know I'm a muthaf-cking monster
I'ma need to see your f-cking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your f-cking hands at the ....
The best living or dead hands down huh?
less talk more head right now huh?
and my eyes more red than the devil is
and I'm bout to take it to another level bitch
there you go again, aint nobody as cold as this
do the rap and the track triple double no assist
but my only focus is staying on some bogus sh-t
argue with my older bitch acting like I owe her sh-t
I heard the people sayin raps are gettin trap mayne
bought the chain that always give me back pain
f-ckin up my money so yeh I had to act sane
Chi n-gga but these hoes love my accent
she came up to me and said this the number 2
if you wanna make it number one your number 2 now
this that goose an' malibu I call it Malibooya
God damn Yeezy How I hit em with the new style
know that muthaf-cker well, what you gon do now
whatever ever I wanna do, gosh its cool now
nah gonna do, uhh its a new now
think yo muthaf-cker really reall need to cool down
cause you will never get on top off this
so mommy best advice is to get on top of this
have you ever had sex with a pharoah
I put the p-ssy in a sarcophagus
now she claiming I bruise her esophagus
head of the class and she just want a swallowship
I'm living the future so the presence is my past
my presence is a present kiss my ass
[Kanye West - Chorus]
[Jay-Z]
Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong
Lochness, Goblin, Ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
question what do all these things have in common
everybody knows I'm a muthaf-cking monster
conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
none of you n-ggas know where the swamp is
none of you n-ggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still here fiends scream in my dream
murder murder in black convertibles
I kill a block I murder avenues
rape and pillage a village, women and children
everybody wanna know what my achilles heel is
LOVE I dont get enough of it
all I get is these vampires and blood suckers
all I see is these n-ggas I've made millionnaires
milling about, spilling there feelings in the air (shot at Beanie?)
all I see is these fake f-cks with no fangs
tryna draw blood with my ice cold veins
I smell a massacre
seems to be the only way to back you bastards up
[Chorus]
[Nicki Minaj]
Pull up in the monster
automobile gangster
with a bad b-tch that came from Sri Lanka
yeah I'm in that Tonka, colour of Willy Wonka
you could be the King but watch the Queen conquer
ok first things first I'll eat your brains
then I'mma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
cause that's what a muthaf-cking monster do
hairdresser from Milan, thats the monster do
monster Giuseppe heel that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and the monster crew
and I'm all up all up all up in the bank with the funny face
and if I'm fake I aint notice cause my money aint
let me get this straight wait I'm the rookie
but my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50k for a verse, no album out!
yeah my money's so tall that my barbie's gotta climb it
hotter than a middle eastern climate
find it Tony Matterhorn dutty wine it
while it, nicki on them titties when I sign it
how these n-ggas so one-track minded
but really really I don't give a F-U-C-K
forget barbie f-ck nicki she's fake
she's on a diet but my pockets eating cheese cake
and I'll say bride of Chucky is Child's play
just killed another career it's a mild day
besides 'Ye they can't stand besides me
I think me, you and Am [Amber Rose] should menage friday
pink wig thick ass give em whip lash
I think big get cash make em blink fast
now look at what you just saw I think this is what you live for
aaaahhh, I'm a muthaf-cking monster!
[Bon Iver]
I-I crossed the line-line
and I'll-I'll let God decide-cide
I-I wouldn't last these shows
so I-I am headed home
(repeated)
