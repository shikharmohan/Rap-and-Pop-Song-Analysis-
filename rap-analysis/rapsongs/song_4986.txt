Welcome to my sex room
Welcome to my sex room
Welcome to my little sanctuary
You've been lookin' so good all day
And you really got a nigga
Pretty anxious, baby
Better call your boss
Tell him that your daddy's home
Take a couple days off
And take it off and leave nothing but your t-shirt and your panties on
Feelin' high but I'm hung real low
Lookin' sorta like a tripod
So power down your cell phone
And power up your iPod
Power down your inhibitions
And power up your inner freak
(Yes, yes, fuck)
It's the only words that you finna speak
It's about to get real x-rated
Can you handle what I'm 'bout to do?
But enough about me, let me think
Should I be worryin' about if I can handle you
Damn right, I'mma get that thang
And I'mma put my name on it
All night I'mma whip that thang
Allstate better put a claim on it
I claim my territory
My tongue finna mark you up
You could be my firecracker
My tongue finna spark you up
Get ready for blast off
Waterfall's gon' splash off
You might lose around 4 or 5 pounds
So get ready to sweat your ass off
Welcome to my sex room
Where your body meets my body
It's our private after party
If you want it, girl, I got it in my sex room
Candles and a pole
Sets your body to your soul
From the bed down to the floor
Sex room
Mirrors in the headboard
Even got a camcord
Baby, won't you dance in my sex room?
Where your body meets my body
It's our private after party
If you want it, girl, I got it in my sex room
Let the candles burn
I'mma turn these lights down
And when your body gets hot
It'll get you licked up and iced down
Nipples hard as rocks
Lips as soft as cotton
You the apple of my eye
And I got you spoiled rotten
I'mma get my video camera
Let's make a movie, baby
You the star so as soon as I press record
You gots to do me, baby
You can stare all in the mirror
Take a peek at how good you lookin'
I'mma have your body smokin'
Take a look at what Luda's cookin'
My arm underneath your leg, legs
Or behind your head is how I gots to get you
Right hand, left hand all red in the bed
Like we've been playin' twister
Now I've got you tangled up
And you caught all in my web
Should I let you loose?
Nah, I think I'll get the blindfold instead
You better get a couple towels, baby
'Cause we about to slip and slide
You don't ever need a horse or a saddle
I'mma give you this dick to ride
I'mma grant your every wish
And fulfill your fantasy
Ain't nobody else allowed in the sex room
It's only you and me
Welcome to my sex room
Where your body meets my body
It's our private after party
If you want it, girl, I got it in my sex room
Candles and a pole
Sets your body to your soul
From the bed down to the floor
Sex room
Mirrors in the headboard
Even got a camcord
Baby, won't you dance in my sex room?
Where your body meets my body
It's our private after party
If you want it, girl, I got it
Listen to what your body say
We can do it every other kinda way
Hit it in the sun, up in the shade
Tell me what it is, I gotcha, babe
Baby, let's hop up in the shower
Baby, let me snatch up off that towel
Let me get a vowel, I-O-U
So I-E-U mean I eat you
Come into this room
You know what I'mma do
Grab my body tight, don't let me go
How you wanna ride, just let me know
In my sex room
All that I wanted
Legs in the air
With your toes pointed
So, baby, welcome to my sex room
Where your body meets my body
It's our private after party
If you want it, girl, I got it in my sex room
Candles and a pole
Sets your body to your soul
From the bed down to the floor
Sex room
Mirrors in the headboard
Even got a camcord
Baby, won't you dance in my sex room?
Where your body meets my body
It's our private after party
If you want it, girl, I got it in my sex room
I got it right here
In my sex room
