I'm not saying this to shake you up
I'm just saying this to wake you up
It's all good when we making love
All I ask is don't take our love
For granted, it's granted
My love for you is real
Baby, if you don't love me
Somebody else will
So don't you ever
Get too comfortable
Yeah, to the left, to the left
If you want to leave, be my guest, you can step
Feeling irreplaceable listening to Beyonce
But okay, I'll put you out on your Bday
Now if you rocking with Weezy
Bedroom in the bank, baby, we safe
I got game like E.A.
But I want to let you play
And don't I treat you like soufflÃÂ©?
Don't I look at you like I see a new day?
And don't I do what I do say?
I'm through talking, so I'm a let you, Face
I'm not saying this to shake you up
I'm just saying this to wake you up
It's all good when we making love
All I ask is don't take our love
For granted, it's granted
My love for you is real
Baby, if you don't love me
Somebody else will
So don't you ever
Get too comfortable
Yeah, let me catch my breath
You talking 'bout leave, baby, you ain't gone yet
And if you leave, leave correct
And I'ma send a jet to pick up the next
And if you leave, you're leaving the best
So, you would have to settle for less
I am no Eliot Ness, I don't handcuff, I don't arrest
I do confess to the virginsy 'cause under them sheets I am a mess
Yes, baby, you blessed, not chess, don't jump your nest
I'm not saying this to shake you up
I'm just saying this to wake you up
It's all good when we making love
All I ask is don't take our love
For granted, it's granted
My love for you is real
Baby, if you don't love me
Somebody else will
So don't you ever
Get too comfortable
Yeah, it's no sweat no sweat
I will never 1, 2, 3, 4get
About you, your love, your sex
You know I work you out like bow flex
Our jokes, no stress
Love, live life, proceed, progress
Make sure the neighbors get no rest
We can get together, never disconnect
Your back, your neck
Funny how that song hasn't got old yet, to us
So let's project
You stay in, never incorrect
Face
I'm not saying this to shake you up
I'm just saying this to wake you up
It's all good when we making love
All I ask is don't take our love
For granted, it's granted
My love for you is real
Baby, if you don't love me
Somebody else will
So don't you ever
Get too comfortable
