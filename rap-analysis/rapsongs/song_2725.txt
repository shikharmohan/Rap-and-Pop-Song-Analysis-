Trouble seems to catch a motherfucker with his cards down
 Gotta keep my drawers up, shit's gettin hard now
 These motherfuckin cops be plantin shit on these niggas
 Simply cause these niggas got bank accounts that's bigga
I just can't get no peace from u motherfuckin rollers
 Everytime I pull my Benz or what watch cha pull me over
 I'm sick of motherfuckers who be checkin Whitey's coke tip
 Blacker than a motherfucker, sweat me bout` dope sip
 Niggas just take your cut and get yo ass out my face
 The only thing you probably get from me is a cock sucking pistol case
 Unless you plan on plantin a lil' somethin in my shit
 Just because you ain't got shit, bitch
 Give em a badge and a trigger and that makes em figure
 That they can fuck with a million dolla nigga
 They got u mixed up, fixed up in the Segas, shookin Indo
 Getting fucked up in the gank hole
 The only way you'll whip that motherfucker is when you whip that
 Motherfucker
 And we choke the motherfucker (Me Stuck the motherfucker!)
 So when you hear my song and wanna get it on
 You better come prepared motherfucker. You dyin wit cha boots on.
 Chorus: Put your foot in my shit and let me try on your hood
         Dyin wit cha boots on
         Put your foot in my shit and let me try on your hood
         Yeah
  Interlude(prison guard talkin' to inmate):
    Guard: Do you know how many years you're facin inside?
           25 to life and that's on the real
           So you better snitch on your partner
    Inmate: Fuck that! It was Brad Dawg, I ain't goin out by myself.
            Niggas getting caught, doin time so they snitchin
            They pickin niggas up on funky suspicion
            We'll be goin down for some questionin we think
            And end up gettin hit wit the fuckin kitchen sink
            Rackteer and laundering, Kingpin wondering
            If they got some unsolved murders then give them some of them
            Just because we're niggas and they figure we're no smarter
            We sell each other albums, start frattin our partners
            They start bringin up shit that happened back in 85
             And then comes the largest jury bitch they fuckin time
             You might as well play the state
             Cos you come to day for day
             And sellin out your homeboys ain't the shit
             Cos ya'll gon have to die in this bitch, bitch 
             Lobbin wit cha white suit on 
             And dyin wit cha motherfuckin boots on
 Put ya foot in my shit and let me try on ya hood
