Re:definition, turning your play into a tragedy
Exhibit level degree on the mic, passionately
Niggaz is sweet so I bet if I bit I'd get a cavity
Livin to get high, you ain't flyer than gravity
We die hard like the battery done in the back of me by the mad mc
Who think imitation is the highest form of flattery, actually
Don't be mad at me, I had to be the one to break it to you
You get kicked into obscurity like judo, no menudo
Cause you pseudo, tryin to compete with reality like xerox
Towards destruction you spiraling like hairlocks, wipe them teardrops
Chasing stars in your eyes, playing games with your lives
Now the wives is widows soakin up pillows, weepin like willows
Still mo' blacks is dyin, kids ain't livin they tryin
"how to make a slave" by willie lynch is still applyin
Regardless, the mos is one of my closest partners
Rockin ever since before prince was called the artist
Rocker before funkmaster flex was rockin starter
When 'pac and biggie was still cool before they was martyrs
Life or death, if I'm choosin with every breath I'm enhancin
Stop, there comes a time when you can't run
[mos def]
What, lyrically handsome, call collect a king's ransom
Jams I write soon become the ghetto anthem
Way out like bruce wayne's mansion, move like a phantom
You'll talk about me to your grandsons
Cats who claimin they hard be mad fag
So I run through em like, flood water through sandbags
Competition is mad, what I got, they can't have
Sinkin they ship, like moby dick, did ahab
Son I'm way past the minimum, it's a verb millenium
My rap's the holy ? in your bag, like palestinians
Ancient abyssinian, try to ? the ? 
Official b-boy gentlemen won't turn off at the interim
Born inside the winter wind, day after december 10
These simpletons they mentionin the synonym for feminine
Sweeter than some cinnamon the danish brings rotten to men
Rush up on adrenaline, they get they asses sent to them
(gentlemen) without a tenament more than a ? 
Leave your unit tremblin like herds of movin elephant
Intelligent embellishment, follow for your element
From flatbush settlement, skin posseses melanin
Hotter than tales of crack peddlin, makin em woop
Like blue gelatin, swing like duke ellington
Broader than barrington levy, believe me
The hot oppresion rent who burn down your chief teepee
You see me? 
One two three, mos def and talib kweli

I said, one two tree, black star shine eternally
We came to rock it on to the tip-top
Because we rulin hip-hop, yes we is rulin hip-hop
