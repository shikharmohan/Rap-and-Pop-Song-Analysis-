There are seven known wonders of the world
You about to witness the eighth, muthafucka
I got King Kong in my trunk, King Kong in my doors
My nuts play ping-pong from the noise
You can hear me from a block away
I'm sittin' next to your ass
And can't hear what you got to say
My shit is loud, my ears is ringin'
My paint job is wet, my chrome is gleamin'
I feel like a vet ballin' on these rookies
An old-school bully, you must have played hooky
I bring it like a bookie, my aggression is depressin'
Don't give a muthafucka time to learn his lesson
A lunatic, y'all know what I represent
The only rapper that wanna fist fight the president
It take a nation of niggas to hold us back
It take a nation of niggas to hold us back
It take a nation of niggas to hold us back
It take a nation of niggas to hold us back
When I bang this, it's dangerous, nigga's go brainless
So bang this with the four five stainless
And understand that you lookin' at the famous
West-coast rapper who act like a anus
Hollywood, they thought they could tame this
Pit-bull, but I know what the game is
Them fuckers cheat like an NBA ref
If you smoke one, they'll electrocute you to death
I got God on my intellect, Godzilla by the neck
When the nigga come through, who you wanna holler at?
Ghostwriters hit the deck, when ya boi got a tech
Where the fuck is Africa Bambaataa at?
We need to take it back, fuck Viacom
Clear Clear Channel and Radio One
You muthafuckas programmed by the programmers
That's why you gettin' locked up by the dope slammers
Not me
It take a nation of niggas to hold us back
It take a nation of niggas to hold us back
It take a nation of niggas to hold us back
It take a nation of niggas to hold us back
They music so fluffy, I'm a stay gutter
That shit is kinda popcorn, my shit is so butter
My style never change in twenty two summers
Straight independent and doin' my numbers
This shit don't sell, you know I'm still paid
So sour-puss nigga's can drink lemonade
I'm doin' it for the love, you doin' it because
You need that advancement to spend on them dubs
I don't need a penny but I need many
Don't worry 'bout my money boy, 'cause I got plenty
You muthafucka's worry 'bout flossin' so much
You don't know the fundamentals
You forgot how to brush
These thirty two teeth will give your ass grief
Bite you like a fat burger if you got beef
So whose it gonna be, your favorite MC?
You're scared of the government
They scared of me, now what?
It take a nation of niggas to hold us back
It take a nation of niggas to hold us back
It take a nation of niggas to hold us back
It take a nation of niggas and streets of crack
So young, so angry
Damn that rap music
