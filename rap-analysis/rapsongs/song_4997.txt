Daddy is that your car on TV?
You better believe it is baby, now go in the other room
It's 'bout to be some grown folks talkin' here, okay?
All right
Yeah, things ain't always what they seem or cracked up to be
Like all these fakin' ass rappers in this industry
Talkin' 'bout what they got and they ain't got a damn thang
How you own three cars but you don't own your own name?
Get your business right, boys, the first class is in session
Get a entertainment lawyer in the music profession
Start up your own company, trademark the name
That's gon' run ya about a grand, so start savin' your change
Open a bank account quick and then follow these steps
Sign yourself to yourself and start signin' ya own checks
Hit the booth and start recordin' at the speed and need
Whatever gets your juices flowin', could be speed or weed
Get it mixed and mastered, pressed up and plastered
Sell it to your whole hood out the trunk, ya bastard
Show all the non-believers what you destined to be
And in just a couple years, you could be rich like me
But I can't hold my tongue, I'ma tell it like it is
This biz ain't all fun, I'ma tell it like it is
Give it to you straight, no chase, I'ma tell it like it is
Look you straight in yo' face and I'ma tell it like it is
I can't hold my tongue, I'ma tell it like it is
This biz ain't all fun, I'ma tell it like it is
Give it to you straight, no chase, I'ma tell it like it is
Look you straight in yo' face and I'ma tell it like it is
See mostly all your favorite artists got some serious problems
And money could be the problem but money can't solve 'em
Some get addicted to drugs and flat out lazy
Some taste a little fame and go flat out crazy
I'm close 'cause those close wanna live off my fame
And that type of shit alone'll drive a nigga insane
Not to mention all the vultures, the scandalous promoters
Crabs'll try to sue you, magazines will misquote ya
Most of these label heads, they don't care nothin' about ya
If you stop sellin' records, they'll act like they don't know ya
It's hard mixin' business with pleasure, so don't play
Me and my crew argue and fight like every other day
Rappers ain't above the law but our life is so fast
That we got a special Task Force of police on our ass
All that and this is really just the start of it
Hip hop, you really wanna be a part of it?
I can't hold my tongue, I'ma tell it like it is
This biz ain't all fun, I'ma tell it like it is
Give it to you straight, no chase, I'ma tell it like it is
Look you straight in yo' face and I'ma tell it like it is
I can't hold my tongue, I'ma tell it like it is
Man, this biz ain't all fun, I'ma tell it like it is
I'ma give it to you straight, no chase, I'ma tell it like it is
Look you straight in yo' face and I'ma tell it like it is
What's worse than havin' no money is havin' it and losin' it
What's worse than havin' some money is grabbin' and abusin' it
We never took no money from Chingy, thought I was cool with him
I wish his ass well but I don't want nothin' to do with him
Some don't own they publishin', me, I never fool with 'em
I'm down for my artists, try my best to stay true to 'em
'Cause outside my label, competition is irrelevant
Unless I'm still in competition with my president
And believe that I'm supportin' the Hova
'Cause the industry's shady, it needs to be 'Taken Over'
But the first rule to accumulation of wealth
Is don't trust nobody but your goddamn self
I can't hold my tongue, I'ma tell it like it is
Man, this biz ain't all fun, I'ma tell it like it is
I'ma give it to you straight, no chase, I'ma tell it like it is
Look you straight in yo' face and I'ma tell it like it is
I said, I can't hold my tongue, I'ma tell it like it is
This biz ain't all fun, I'ma tell it like it is
I'ma give it to you straight, no chase, I'ma tell it like it is
Look you straight in yo' face and I'ma tell it like it is
Daddy, are you finished this grown folk talk?
Yeah, baby, you can come back in here
Come give Daddy a kiss, you know I love you, right?
And I love you always
