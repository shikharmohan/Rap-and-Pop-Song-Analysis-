Journey with me
Into the mind of a maniac
Doomed to be a killer
Since I came out the nutsac
I'm in a murderous mindsate
With a heart full of terror
I see the devil in the mirror
Buck, buck, lights out
'Cause when I get my sawed off
Niggaz get hauled off
(Ha ha, barrel one)
Touches your motherfuckin' flesh
(Barrel two)
Shoots your fuckin' heart out your chest
You see I'm quick to let the hammer go click
On my Tec-9 so if you try to reck mine
Fool it's your bad time
Feel the blast of the chocolate bomber
Infra red aimed at your head
Like your name was Sarah Conner
Decapitatin', I ain't hesitatin'
To put you in the funeral home
With a bullet in your dome
I'm hot like lava
You got a problem?
I got a problem solver
And his name is revolver
It's like a deadly game of freeze tag
I touch you with a 44 mag
And your frozen inside a body bag
Nobody iller
Than this graveyard filler
Cap peeler
'Cause I'm a natural born killa
Terror illistrates my era
Now I cant hang around my momma
'Cause I scare her
I'm quick to blast motherfucker
(Yeah, what's up?)
It feels like I'm bustin' a nut
When I open you up
'Cause your body is exposed to the midnight mist
All you weak motherfuckers give my ring a kiss
'Cause I'm givin' dirt naps
Comin' with them bomb ass raps
To make your lungs collapse
Perhaps, you never sleep
'Cause ever time you doze
You catch blows to the motherfuckin' nose
Ain't seen the sun in 66 days
Let me count the ways in a fucked up maze
I never ever ever made a hoe stay
But I'm down with Dre
Like AC is down with OJ
So fuck how your livin'
I'm the unforgivin'
Psycho drivin' murdera
It's authentic, don't panic
I can't stand it
Goddamn it
Schizophrenic
So fuck Charlie Manson
I'll snatch him out of his truck
Hit 'em with a brick
And I'm dancin'
Mass murderer, natural born killa
And I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna
I don't wanna die
I don't understand the logic in my dreams
But I understand I like the sound of sirens
Terrified screams from the streams
Of Strycnine
Dumpin' on any motherfucker tryin' to trick mine
'Cause motherfuckers wanna violate
Now they stiff and cold
And they pupils won't dialate
It's so much pain
Migraine
Headache
I can hear his bones break
He steps in the single door
Gets his ass whipped with 20 lashes
Like that dude up in Singapore
So I'm a pull a fuckin' Jeffrey Dahmer
Now I'm suicidal just like Nirvana
Tic Toc
Toc Tic Toc Tic
Dr. Dre and Ice Cube
On some murderous shit
Keepin' niggaz in order
Makin' there live shorter
Ready to slaughter
'Cause to me a life ain't worth a quarter
Or a dime
Mushroom's got my mind
Hallicinatin', ain't no debatin'
I'm creatin' an escape
Route to be out without a doubt
Scot Free so don't even think
About tryin' to stop me
'Cause I can't wait
I'm out the gate
On the for realla
A thrilla
Or a natural born killa
Gi Gi Gi Gi Ga Ga
They call me, Da Da
6 million ways to murder
Choose one, lose one soul
Bodies turn cold
Natural fright from niggaz goin'
Bump in the night
Should I peely
Should I kill her in my iller
Then a natural born killa
Should I peely
Should I kill her in my iller
Then a natural born killa
Should I peely
Should I kill her in my iller
Then a natural born killa
