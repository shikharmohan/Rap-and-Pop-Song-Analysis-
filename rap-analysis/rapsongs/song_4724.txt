1, 2, 3 o' clock, 4 o' clock, rock
5, 6, 7 o' clock, 8 o' clock, rock
9, 10, 11 o' clock, 12 o' clock, rock
Gonna rock, rock, rock around the clock
Three years ago in St. Albans, Queens
I was rockin' at a park called One Eighteen
Little kids stood and watched as I rocked the spot
Didn't know, years later I'll be standin' on top
Livin' Farmers Boulevard I was born and base shaw
Stopped the rich and shake hands with the poor
And this is a story about a brother I know
Cut Creator on the fader, now watch him go
Go, go Cut Creator, go
Go Cut Creator, go
Go Cut Creator, go
Go, go Cut Creator, go
Go Cut Creator, go
Go Cut Creator, go
Way back in the days before I clocked some dough
I used to go to the show and sit in the front row
Hopin' and prayin' one day I'll get on the road
So I had a feeler and a summer and I meet when I'm stoned
Not fearin' a thought, got stung like a horse
Don't make fun of my posse 'cause each man is a boss
When his only damn way to pull a jam out the crate
One time for your mind, check out the guitar break
Go, go Cut Creator, go
Go Cut Creator, go
Go Cut Creator, go
Go, go Cut Creator, go
Go Cut Creator, go
Go Cut Creator, go
This jam just wasn't enough for Jimmy Hendrix to see
[Incomprehensible] lessons of mixin', take you under his wing
Straight from the heart 'cause it ain't the money that we came here for
Ain't no thoughts in the room, ain't breakin' no roles
And in the Rock 'n' Roll land, a big strivin' plan
Just my posse learn the vocals, what little we had
It's all about us three, Eve, Phil and Jay
He heard Cut Creator cut now check it out to play
Go, go Cut Creator, go
Go Cut Creator, go
Go Cut Creator, go
Go, go Cut Creator, go
Go Cut Creator, go
Go Cut Creator, go
Rock, rock, y'all, check out the funky cut
It's like travelin' through time to the straight cats strut
Cuts are slicker than Grease, needle sharper than knife
We'll be do doin' the doo for the rest of the lines
Who want a piece of the action? It's time to party, get up
Not a subway bummy singer puttin' change in a cup
Wanna see you boogie, oogie jumpin' up and down
Bitin' your livin' hold your breath until we come to your town
LL Cool J is hard as
Cut Creator cut the record for me
Go, go Cut Creator, go
Go Cut Creator, go
Go Cut Creator, go
Go, go Cut Creator, go
Go Cut Creator, go
Go Cut Creator, go
LL Cool J is hard as
Go, go, go, go
Go, go Cut Creator, go
Go Cut Creator, go
Go Cut Creator, go
LL Cool J is hard as hell
