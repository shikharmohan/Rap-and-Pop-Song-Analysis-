[Lil Wayne]
Yeah, uh huh, um uh huh
Hello mother fucker hey hi how ya do'ern?
It's Weezy F baby come to take a shit and urine on the toilet bowl bitches, pussy ass niggas
stomping on this beat like a motherfuckerin sigma
Bad to the bristle
Hat to the rizzle
I'm so official all I need is a whistle
Bitch named crystal,
Let her suck my pistol,
She opened up her mouth,
And then I blow her brains out,
You ain't met a nigga like me,
you probably never will,
Riders rollin' with me like 11 wheels
Find out where you livin'
kill you in the kitchen
The feds trying to clip us but we ain't even trippin'
[Chorus]
I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in, 
and I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard, 
bitch I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in,
and I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
[Drake]
First off you know what it is if you heard drake
Making hoes wobble like a bridge in a earth quake
Never see me out, cause I live in my work place
I give you the business so button up your shirt straight
Look at where I landed
You would think i planned it
I'm just doing me and you can never understand it
Chicks get hammered
Big dick bandit
Money flowing like a slit wrist
No bandage
Blowing purple clouds nigga
I'm so sky high
I ain't cutting anybody slices out of my pie
Out of this world though
I'm so SciFi
And I don't sit still, I keep it moving like a drive-by
I just tell the truth and so I'm cool in every hood spot
Twenty one years and I ain't never met a good cop
Me and Wayne lean like Kareem doin hook shots
Cover me I'm goin in to fuck you when the hook drops 
[Chorus]
I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in, 
and I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard, 
bitch I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in,
and I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
[Young Jeezy]
Ya gotta hold up wait one mother fucking minute
It's the el capitan, I got mother fucking lieutenants
If i said I'm going in then I mother fucking meant it
If I brought it in the club then I'm gonna mother fuckin spend it
Toss a few hundred bands and I'm mother fuckin in it
No need for a room yeah you know I'm fucking in it
She actin' like she not, but she know she fuckin went in
She said "I seen it all", I said "no you fuckin didn't"
You ever bust 10 nuts in a two seater?
She said I can't feel my legs, I'm like bitch me neither
Im going in, when should I begin?
I don't even know, maybe when my blunt ends
and I'ma be a legend even when my life ends
and I'ma be a legend even when this night ends
Cause I do my thing up a body like bim
Bitch I said I'm him so I'm nothing like them
[Chorus]
I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in, 
and I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard, 
bitch I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in,
and I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
