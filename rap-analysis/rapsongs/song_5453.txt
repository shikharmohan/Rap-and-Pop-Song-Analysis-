I be dippin' in clubs, girls screamin', "Do you want it Timb?"
Niggaz, playa hatin' sayin', "Who the hell is him?"
I'm in the back, gleamin' from all that virgin gem
Keep a bunch of pretty models surroundin' Timb
I'm over capac'y when it come to makin' them beats
Me and Missy makin' y'all, move y'all feets
Makin' y'all dance and Tango, make y'all legs get weak
That's only 'cause we drop a bunch of heat
That's whatcha gonna expect, comin' from my crew
Bunch of dope beats, and a bunch of dope lyrics too
I know that's too much for you to handle dude
Now ask yourself what
Whatcha gon' do? Whatcha gon' do?
Whatcha gon' do? Whatcha gon' do?
Whatcha gon' do? Whatcha gon' do?
Whatcha gon' do? Whatcha gon' do?
When me come in the spot, dem wannn' jock
Dem nasty boy lookin' around, with big cocks
Them girls be plottin' on how to get the rocks
So I beat that ass to the ground like I'm the cops
Ahh, what they gon' say, ahh, don't wan' play
Rrr, get 'em in the club, ahh, smokin' on hay, hey
Ahh, when I'm in my ride, oh ahh, people walkin' by
Ah ahh, pistol by my side, b-brrr, in case dem wan' try
Whatcha gon' do? Whatcha gon' do?
Whatcha gon' do? Whatcha gon' do?
Whatcha gon' do? Whatcha gon' do?
Whatcha gon' do? Whatcha gon' do?
I be gettin' in girls clothes, make 'em buy my whole wardrobe
Better get all my dough, pluckin' the hair in my nose
It's official I'm a pimp, 'cause my name glows
Even I'm back to the Yugos
Talkin' that junk, you get burried
You don't wanna end up in the cemetary
Me and Timbaland got tracks that will kill you
Anyother hen I got gats that will pell you
Whatcha gon' say, rrr, whatcha gon' do, rrr
When I'm in the club, rrr, comin' for you
I'm just a smooth motherfucker
Whatcha gon' say, rrr, whatcha gon' do, rrr
When I'm in the club, rrr, and comin' for you
I'm just a smooth motherfucker
Whatcha gon' do? Whatcha gon' do?
Whatcha gon' do? Whatcha gon' do?
Whatcha gon' do? Whatcha gon' do?
Whatcha gon' do? Whatcha gon' do?
Whatcha gon' do? Whatcha gon' do?
Whatcha gon' do? Whatcha gon' do?
Whatcha gon' do? Whatcha gon' do?
Whatcha gon' do? Whatcha gon' do?
