So gather round now for the raptism
'Cause if the dogs don't get 'em
The cattle get 'em or the gat'll get 'em
Or the crack'll get 'em
Time for spiritual activism
Life is a journey
And Kris got the map with him
Teach Latinos and blacks with 'em
It's amazing when Whites
And Asians kick raps with 'em
'Cause out of a thousand MC's
Believe I taught half of 'em
Knowledge Reigns Supreme
I beam through many images
My origin is a mystery
Like capstones on pyramids
We live it kid, challenge
The teacher you will regret that
I'm giving careers and taking careers away
Did you forget that?
Better check that you can rock
This track and the next track
But when I correct the spirit hit
You'll always be set back
So gather round now for the raptism
Only those that got hip-hop in 'em
And not rap in 'em and no crack with 'em
Step up now and receive a holy dose
From a holy host and take a break
From these rappers that only boast
Wake up to make up
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Wake up to make up
Huh, huh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Wake up to make up
Yo, yeah, yo
My intellectual battle
Will make your brains rattle
I'll unwrap you and your crew
From the same shackle
I'm on many different planes like a airport
Psychologically you be rethinkin'
Your identity and cuttin' ya hair short
Now there's a thought
That exposes your insecurity
You put no fear in me
I break the M from the C
And reverse it to say, "See 'em? See 'em?"
They allow the devil to lead 'em
And they be givin' up they freedom
So, huh, gather round for the raptism
Wake up
When the spirit hear it the lyric long before the track get 'em
Wake up
I spit 'em out, gotta get 'em out, the world I never been about
I see them glitter but their spirit's goin' in and out
We see them fading, we also see them hating
We also see those living for musical chart ratings
Hear what I'm stating or trading for what you're paying
Replace fear with faith and you'll stop decaying
Gather round for the raptism
(Word)
Gather round for the raptism
(Word, word)
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Gather round for the raptism
Make up, make up, make up
'Cause if the dogs don't get 'em
The cattle get 'em or the gat'll get 'em
Or the crack'll get 'em
Yo, yo, gather round for the raptism
Wake up, word, word
Wake up, word
Wake up, the dogs don't get 'em
The cattle get 'em, or the crack'll get 'em
Or the gat'll get 'em
Wake up, everyday, when you wake up
You got a chance to make up
Remember you are not just doing hip-hop
You are hip-hop
Wake up to make up, wake up to make up
Twice a year, hip-hoppers come together
To celebrate the unity of hip-hop
We come together, during Hip-Hop Appreciation Week
Wake up to make up
Which is every third week in May
Wake up to make up
Then, we come together in November
To celebrate Hip-Hop History Month
I will see you there, peace
