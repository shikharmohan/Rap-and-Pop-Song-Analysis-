Yea.yea.yea.yea
This is the Carter muthafucka, yea
And in my building I must keep it real
[Lil Wayne]
And man I miss the times, we would shine, you would keep me on your side
You would teach me how to ride and you would teach me how to pry
Then we get on the line and go over our lines
We were in the same position and that's when you change positions, shit
I never change and I miss ya, and its strange but I never forget ya
though that aint you in them pictures homie
And I know that aint you wit that dissin on me
That's why I never replied and never will just let em live phony
If ya ever died I swear to God I got yo kids homie
Whats mine is theirs I gotta give homie, and yea
We still a army in this bitch homie
Yea Cash Money still the shit homie, shit homie

That Hot Boy shit still in me nigga, word the giggity nigga
And I aint got time to speak the history

[Hook: Reel (Lil Wayne) Repeat X2]
Man I miss my dawg(yea)
Many nights club hoppin(yea)
Many nights we were blowin trees(yea)
Many nights we were hustlin(yea)
Man I miss my dawg(yea)
Me and you through thick and thin(yea)
Me and you to the very end(yea)
For only you I'll sin again(yea)
[Lil Wayne]
And I remember when you came to the click
I had already made my name in the click, but you got famous and shit
I got my soulja rag and dangled my shit
I was down to just to hang wit you shit
And I banged to the boogie bang bang wit yo click
And I aint even from the 3, my hood was angry at me, shit
But I rose to my feet, played the post wit the heat
At them shows while you performed and posed
I was waitin for a nigga to jump, see I was patient but was ready to dump
'cause you my brother chump
Real Gs never buckle up
But every family aint filled wit gangstas that's real
And that's real and I would never turn my back or turn ya down
Even if you turned around muthafucka
But history is history
I miss you and I know you missin me
Juve but

[Lil Wayne]
You was my nigga, my nerd, my joy, my hurt
My main muthafuckin man Turk (oh)
My other, my partner, I was teacher, he was father
I skilled, he schooled, we chilled, we moved
We dug, we hung, we ate, we slept
We lived, we died, I stayed, you left
Remember how we played to the left
And we stayed out of trouble 'cause we stayed to our self
Member Slim and B would leave and hand the keys over
Tell me not to go Uptown and we went straight to tha Nolia
While I watched you reunite wit yo souljas
And yo moms and brother, while I lied to the stunna
Yea those were the times my brother
Now I recognize real and now im my brother
Yea nigga sub mage my brother, the Sqad's my brother
The nigga you left behind is my brothers
