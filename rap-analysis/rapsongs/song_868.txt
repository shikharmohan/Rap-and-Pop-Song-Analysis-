When they tell you that you'll never get over
Just tell 'em they're number one
You're a champion
Don't believe 'em when they try to say it's over
Just tell 'em they're number one
You're a champion
Now, there's nothin' you can do to stop a nigga from within
With the hunger of a lion, I secure another win
So passionate, you might even misinterpret it as arrogance
I'm goin' in
I'ma make the world feel my pain
While I'm showin' you my muscle and I hustle through the game
And even though they leave us in the hood like we ain't shit
We ain't got nothin' but everythin' to gain
Look, even if a muh'fucker try to pop me
I'm so blessed, do anythin' that you could do to stop me, stop me
Now I'm climbin' up the ladder and I'm jumpin' at the top
You might wanna call me Rocky
See there's more of us, ugly
You don't really wanna war with us, trust me
So glorious
Though we from the bottom still we victorious
I see it in your eyes
It ain't hard to tell, they're watchin' you
Can't nobody ever stop what I'm doin'
They just tellin' you lies
They want you to fail, they're plottin' on you
And they can never stop my movement
So don't believe 'em when they try to say it's over
You know exactly what to tell 'em
Just tell 'em they're number one
You're a champion
Hey, see the websites lyin', tryin' to block my shine
Don't you know you never will stop my grind?
In a drop-top flyin' like I don't got time
Got e'rybody surprised that I won't drop dimes
What's on yo' mind? Best get me off it
At least quit lyin' if you must keep talkin'
Go on with the nonsense, best keep walkin'
Boy, how you sue us, send the lawyers to the office?
A lot of y'all got sprung like that shawty
Couple o' months off, I'll be right back shawty
With a brand new swag and a brand new 40
And a brand new ride, give a damn who saw it
Nationwide news, nigga, yeah, you saw it
Shawty need a bodyguard for his bodyguard, don't he?
Tip fallin' off sound kinda odd, don't it?
Y'all hate to see me ball? Take it up with God, homie
I see it in your eyes
It ain't hard to tell, they're watchin' you
Can't nobody ever stop what I'm doin'
They just tellin' you lies
They want you to fail, they're plottin' on you
And they can never stop my movement
So don't believe 'em when they try to say it's over
You know exactly what to tell 'em
Just tell 'em they're number one
You're a champion
Any situation where you might get fed up
Gotta stay focused, homie, keep your head up
It don't really matter what the next one is doin'
Homie, gotta handle your women, I think you better step up
Live to the fullest for the dream you're pursuin'
Ain't nothin' in the work gon' really stop what you're doin'
Go hard no matter what they be sayin'
Nigga, don't quit 'cause you know we gotta keep it movin'
Take a look and see yourself in me
'Cause it's all about we
Me and you securin' a win together
So we could be the best that we could ever be
Stay up on your grind, be the first one to set it
People try to shut me down, I won't let it
I'm so stubborn for the success
You know my motto, 'Don't stop, get it, get it'
I see it in your eyes
It ain't hard to tell, they're watchin' you
Can't nobody ever stop what I'm doin'
They just tellin' you lies
They want you to fail, they're plottin' on you
And they can never stop my movement
So don't believe 'em when they try to say it's over
You know exactly what to tell 'em
Just tell 'em they're number one
You're a champion
Tell 'em they're number one
Tell 'em they're number one
Tell 'em they're number one
