Warning, this album contains Ludacris material
Parental discretion is advised
So kids, cover your eyes and close your eyes
Otherwise you're about to witness history
The thoughts and views expressed on this album
Are a direct reflection of the new generation
So without further ado
I bring to you, that nigga named Luda
Hey, I be that nigga named Luda, give a round of applause
They say I'm up to no good, I say I'm down for the cause
Down for whatever goes down, I'm strapped down to my drawers
So if you up for some stitches, then I'm down for some scars
Down to make 'em get down, stop playin' and pause
There's two things I'll never break
And that's my word and my balls
So here's a temporary fix for your permanent flaws
This album helps you to release 'cause life is irkin' us all
Enough to make you wanna break shit, no longer will I take shit
From any of these clowns 'cause I'm tired of this fake shit
I'm ready for some action, ready with a passion
Like pots with the steam, I'm ready to get it crackin'
It's six years and countin' if you think I'm a joke
Me gettin' served is like Bill Gates and Oprah goin' broke
It's 'bout time they gave it to me, I'm the reignin' champ
Your favorite rapper went to Ludacris' trainin' camp, beotch
Yeah, shawty, on the real, I feel you on that
Man, I'm tired of all these fake-ass niggas, homes
Hey, hey, this your boy, Lil' Black
Representin' that zone, Trey, you feel me?
All these niggas, hey, I told y'all whole world that I'm the man
I told y'all, homey, nigga just need to get to the money, man
Stop fuckin' with homes, man, feel me?
I just wanna know what he said about Oprah
Don't nobody talk bad about Oprah
You just lost a fan
Man, Joe, I'ma tell you what the bid'ness is
You fuckin' with a true player, true and recognized, ya dig?
Y'all already know the demo, Scary Larry sweet big-ass punks
If you ain't fuckin' with my guy, what is yo' life about?
Kick rocks, skeezer, please
Yo, God, man, Cris can kiss my ass
He remember me, I was at the club right there with him
He, he coulda got me in
I mean I went to Benjamin Banneker High School with him
I knew him before all the fame
That's how you gonna do your people, man?
That's how you gonna do your folk?
Yup, man, I used to cook for this nigga
See, he done come over to my house the other day
Talkin' 'bout he don't eat beef and he don't eat pork
And my homegirl was over there and she was like
"Girl, he look so tall on TV"
I said, "Girl, I told you he was short"
Man, I don't give a damn, I love that nigga
