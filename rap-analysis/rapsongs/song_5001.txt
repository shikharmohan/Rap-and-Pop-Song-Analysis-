Ludacris-
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Give it to me now, give it to me now
Give it to me now, give it to me now
Shawnna-
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Give it to me now, give it to me now
Give it to me now
(chorus) x2
Ludacris & shawnna-
I wanna li li li lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down to the down to the to the floor
I wanna ah ah you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn kn kn know what's your fan-ta-ta-sy
Ludacris-
I wanna get in the Georgia dome on the fifty yard line
When the dirty birds kick the tree
And if you like in the club we can do it
In the DJ booth or in the back of the VIP
Whip cream with cherries, n strawberries on top
Lick it don't stop
With the doe lock
Don't knock 
While the boat rock
We go bots n Robots or they got to wait till the show stop
Or how 'bout on the beach with black sand
Lick up your thigh they call me the pac man
Table top or just give me the lap dance
The rock to the park to the point to the flat lands
That man n Ludacris (woo) in the public bathroom
Or in a back of the classroom
How ever you want it 
Lover lover gonna tap that ass soon
See I cast 'em and I pass 'em 
Get a tight grip and I grasp 'em
I flash 'em and out last 'em
And if ain't good then I trash 'em while you stash 'em
I'll let 'em free
And the tell me what they fantasy
Like up on the roof roof tell your boyfriend not to be mad at me
(chorus)
I wanna get you in the bath tub
With the candles lit you give it up till they go out
Or we can do it on stage of the Ludacris concert
Cause you know it got sold out
Or red carpet dick and just roll out
Go 'head and scream you can't hold out
We can do it in the pouring rain
Runnin the train 
When it's hot or when it's cold out
How 'bout in the library on top of books
But you can't be too loud
You wanna make a brother beg for it
Give me TLC 'cause you know I be too proud
We can do it in the White House
Try ta make them turn the lights out
Champagne with my campaign let me do the damn thing
What's my name, what's my name, what's my name 
Oh a sauna, ja'causezi
In the back row at the movie
You can scratch my back and rule me
You can push me and just pull me
On hay in middle of the barn (woo) rose pedals on the silk sheets uh
Eating fresh fruits sweep yo woman right off of her feet
(chorus)
I wanna get you in the back seat windows up
That's the way you like to fuck 
Clogged up on alert
Rip the pants and rip the shirt
Rough sex make it hurt
In the garden all in the dirt
Roll around 
Georgia brown 
That's the way I like it twerk
Legs jerk, over worked, under paid but don't be afraid
In the sun or up in the shade
On the top of my Escalade
Baby your girl and my friend can trade
Tag team off the rope 
On the ocean or in the boat
Factories, or a hunred spokes
What 'bout in the candy sto' that chocolate chocolate make it melt
Whips and chains, handcuffs, smack a little bootie up with my belt
Scream help 
Play my game
Dracula n I'll get my fangs 
Horse back I'll get my reigns
School teacher let me get my grades
(chorus) x4
