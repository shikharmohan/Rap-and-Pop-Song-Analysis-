I hate to see a nigga on some dummy shit, talkin' big money shit
Livin' wit his mom, swear to God that he runnin' shit
Hey listen, I ain't the one you wanna talk money wit
'Cause I run through and look at you like, where the money at?
You ought be ashamed of you chain, I'm makin' fun of that
Charm flickin' from time to time tryin' to shine
My shit up under my shirt and you admirin' mine
Whoever told you that bullshit will fly you a line
I got a watch wit' no diamonds
Cost twice as much as that bullshit you wear
When you call yourself shinin'
And your ring, boy stop it
You need to take that neck bullshit chain
And put them both in your pocket

But my daddy made a pimp of me
Man, I been fly since junior high and elementary
Man, I been fly since junior high and elementary
Man, I been fly since junior high and elementary
My uncles raised a G but my daddy made a pimp of me
I never been a wannabe, I'm everything you wannabe
As long as bitches lookin', I'ma give 'em what they wanna see
Your outfit cost less than my underclothes
Ya ride ain't shit man, I put my bitch in one of those
My rides ridiculous, five and sixes
Had the Rolls Royce 'til I decided to switch it
Now I'm in the Maybach, notice mines extended
Feet kicked up, curtains closed, mind your business nigga
