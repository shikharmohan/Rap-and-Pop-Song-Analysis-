Playa haters, every minute wanna stop my dough
And every other minute wanna rock my flow
And every third minute y'all wanna swerve in it
Come quick like a virgin in it
So far came through this shit with no bra
Sheer shirt, shakin' my Na Na, this head hurt
Got 'em strung, let 'em know I'm like a Icee
For the best effect you gotta use your tongue
Find my g-spot, get me hot, I'm ill
Foxy, chocolate baby, got milk?
Shake that ass like you just don't care
'Cause y'all just rookies to begin
Work niggaz like you one of the live niggaz
Fly niggaz, known to handle a pie nigga
Chick in a off whit pearl six on the cellular
Gettin' them open like Girl 6, it's on
She's a bad mamma jamma
Just as Foxy as can be
She's a bad mamma jamma
Just as Foxy as can be
Player haters, every minute wanna see your clothes
Then every other minute wanna know what you drove
Then every third minute wanna know if the fur's rented
That's why I got no time for hoes
It's the Brown Fox, surround blocks, sound nice
See me dressed, D B S, brown rocks
See me just play the low pro
Got these rap chicks in a chokehold
Basically, you're wastin' your time hatin' me
I'm like one point five, gotta make it three
My name will forever ring
Got 'em screamin', "Damn, Fox" on everything
Hell yeah for the paper rip a hot draft
Only for the right dough, shorty got that?
Still in here, I'll be down when you're goin' broke
Ill Na Na Master Tracks like Tone and Poke and it's on
She's a bad mamma jamma
Just as Foxy as can be
She's a bad mamma jamma
Just as Foxy as can be
Playa haters, every minute wanna shit on wax
Then every other minute talk behind your back
And every third minute wanna rock you Venice and Bourbon
Nah, I ain't got time for that
I fakes no jacks, I got chips to gain
I'm like Bo Jack baby, I'm hip to the game
I know it well, rock Perotta over Chanel
A H class hoe with the H Findel
Rhyme deep in footwear, via Spiga
Like Aaliyah, one in a million
There's MC's in this rap shit comin' in illin' like I did
Laid the groundwork for five hits
Member when I told y'all, first week out
Shipped a half a mile, niggaz freaked out
Love yourself, put no one above thee
'Cause ain't nobody gon' fuck me like me, it's on
She's a bad mamma jamma
Just as Foxy as can be
She's a bad mamma jamma
Just as Foxy as can be
She's a bad mamma jamma
Just as Foxy as can be
She's a bad mamma jamma
Just as Foxy as can be
