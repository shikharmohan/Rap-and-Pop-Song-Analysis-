Beamers, Bentleys, double R's, Ferraris every time I seen
Shorty, where you're headed tonight?
(Hey, where you headed shorty?)
Sellin' out arenas, chicks with asses like Serena
Man, shorty live a hell of a life
Hell of a life
(I'm tryin' to tell you shorty)
Man, shorty live a hell of a life
(This is how I live, real talk, true story)
I ain't tellin' no lies
Man, shorty live a hell of a life
(I'm tryin' to tell you shorty, this is how I live, real talk, true story)
You know shorty goin' extra hard when they release his passport
Why I need a credit card? What you think this cash for?
Hit the dealership and give them every dime he ask for
Just so I can see 260 on the dashboard
If shinin' against the law, somebody better get the task force
Funny, ho's love me, let me fuck 'em 'til they ass hoarse
Pimpin' 101, just come and see me, take a crash course
You wanna count my money? Go to college, need a math course
On a mad dash for 100 milli runnin'
Breakneck speed 'til I see a billi comin'
I'm built to reach a hundred, feel the grumblin' in my stomach
I'm still stuntin' off the chain, chasin' nothin' for some money
With a couple of pair of queens like I'm playin' gin rummy
No cards, just broads when a nigga dick hard
Flooded offshore, automall lookin' like a car star
Put it in a wristwatch, ballin' like a big shot
Beamers, Bentleys, double R's, Ferraris every time I seen

Swag on fully, no semi ho, hemi
Bankrolls, no gimmicks, drop Rolls, no Emmys
Street cred, no blemish, credit card, no limit
You want Bankhead a spot to drop heads, I'm in it
Been it, a couple of corners hoppin' on 20
With 3 or 4 women givin' love like tennis
All my boxes with the chinese, givin' me the business
While I'mma ride through the city, gag, swallow, no spittin'
Livin' life like I just got out of prison Wednesday night
If your chick is in my sight, then that chick is gettin' right
Hey, I know niggas now with bitches think I'm hittin' and they right
They keep my name out my mouth and mind they business, it's aight
They aight if you see me say aight, okay, aight
'Cause you know I got the goons with me and I pay aight
If they would like to see me go back to prison, see me go
But instead they see me ballin', stuntin' everywhere we go, go

Mind your own phone, pockets so swoll'
Rubber band keep poppin' off my bankroll
I ain't tellin' no lies
Man, shorty live a hell of a life
(This is how I live, real talk, true story)
Brand new cars for my brand new chicks
A hundred bands right fixing to see a man
I ain't tellin' no lies
Man, shorty live a hell of a life
(This is how I live, real talk, true story)
Beamers, Bentleys, double R's, Ferraris every time I seen
