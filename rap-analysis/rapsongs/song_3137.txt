The West Coast warlord
The grime wizard, Ice Cube
[Incomprehensible] head so big
They call him Jack N The Box
Yeah, yeah
I'ma superhero like Lubert Rigno
Maybach, De Niro look like a zero
Shine the spotlight, this is my night
Get your cameras ready, let it rain confetti
I'ma champion, I do what can't be done
In the real league nerd, not the fantasy one
Throw your hands up, you can cheer for ya boy
When I hit the stage, get a ear full of noise
When I bring the noise from here to Illinois
Muthafucka's love when I do what it does
I'm all star, superstar entertainer
World class, first ballad hallafamer
Some rappers claim that they got a heart full of anger
How, when your lyrics were written by a stranger
Fool I'm the greatest, you just the latest
I'm loved by ya grandmama and ya babies
See my head is so big, they call me Jack N The Box
You can't impress me, so fuck what you got
I say my head is so big, they call me Jack N The Box
Don't talk about money 'cause I'm stackin' a lot
Shine that light on me, put that light on me
'Cause I was sent to the world by G O D
Shine that light on me, put that light on me
'Cause I was sent to the world by G O D
I was a born loser, I was a born sinner
Now I am a winner, in the convention center
I got to take a bow, 'cause I still wonder how
The system didn't get me when I was a juvenile
Just think if I had got locked up
No Boys N The Hood, thanks to America
No Eazy, NWA, no fried day
Don't let ya muthafuckin' talent go to waste
Don't catch a case 'cause these people got a place
To throw your life away and take you right out the waist
Throw your hands up, you got to man up
I had to show the world what I was made of
What you say blood, I was a slave 'cause
Now I'm VIP, up in Vegas
I'm up in Nike town, so how you like me now
See the whole industry had to bite my style
See my head is so big, they call me Jack N The Box
I knew we would win, so I'm braggin' a lot
I say my head is so big, they call me Jack N The Box
My shit is so dope, it's like crackin' a pop
Shine that light on me, put that light on me
'Cause I was sent to the world by G O D
Shine that light on me, put that light on me
'Cause I was sent to the world by G O D
Now mama don't be mad, I got to show my ass
And thank these muthafucka's for my past
I got to let them know I neva break like glass
What you lookin' at is top notch world class
Mama don't be mad, I got to show my ass
And thank these muthafucka's for my past
I got to let them know I neva break like glass
What you lookin' at is top notch world class
See my head is so big, they call me Jack N The Box
You can't impress me, so fuck what you got
I say my head is so big, they call me Jack N The Box
Don't talk about money 'cause I'm stackin' a lot
Shine that light on me, put that light on me
'Cause I was sent to the world by G O D
Shine that light on me, put that light on me
'Cause I was sent to the world by G O D
