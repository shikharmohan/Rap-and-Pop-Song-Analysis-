The year is 2000, all the real motherfuckers left
PMD, Def Squad and Hit Squad and the virus
I'll tell you who I be
(Check it)
This is Erick Sermon, one of God's children of billions
With more Hype than Williams
Maintain millions so when the world get close to ending
My squad prepare for squad spending, I ain't begot no weapon
I'm lyin', get caught off guard I'm firin'
Until I hear sirens, I'm gone with the wind
A black Clark Gable, doin' 90 in the Lexus sport a fat cable
Never hold nothing back, I get the stress of my chest
Fell this so all the envious hear this
I catch wreck any punk in my way I'm banded
(Why E?)
'Cuz I'm the last man standin'
"Whatever it takes, how ever it got's to go down
4 mics on stage a motherfuckin' 4 pound"
P of Mobb Deep, hell on earth
Last man standing
"Whatever it takes, how ever it got's to go down
4 mics on stage a motherfuckin' 4 pound"
P of Mobb Deep, hell on earth
Last man standing
Yeah, yo, snap that neck, not playing with a full deck
Make a nigga sweat below the waist line by my johnson
Where my tools kept, who I be? The code name PMD
Casualty to an MC who try to fuck with P or E-Dub
Catch the burner with the snub, no love
A tight defense, like the glove, so bring it
Any song we drop I bet you sing it
Check the logo and slip up and get creamed kid
My pen is registered like Bruce Lee on loose leaf
My crew be, timped down puffing looseys
Drop the slick shit, nigga wanna get with
Swiss Smith, street cat strap?
"Whatever it takes, how ever it got's to go down
4 mics on stage a motherfuckin' 4 pound"
P of Mobb Deep, hell on earth
Last man standing
"Whatever it takes, how ever it got's to go down
4 mics on stage a motherfuckin' 4 pound"
P of Mobb Deep, hell on earth
Last man standing
Black the Ripper, by barracks, cold like anemic
Believe it, it takes years for y'all to achieve it
'Cuz I'm a go getter, I get the loot, I get the cash
The blunt, the weed, the hash
And then white with my friends in the Benz
Smoke fill the car until I blind my lens
I lock down my statis, I be the baddest
Yes, the one that get you open the most outspoken
Shogun assassin', Chinese connection, ninja maskin'
We turnin' to gravity, B-boy with the pants saggin'
Ain't no stoppin', on the case like Johnny Cochran
The beats knockin', mock speed is what I'm clockin'
With Erick Serm, mess with fire you get burned
Like a bad perm it's the return that niggas yearn
What, PMD and the bandit, never stranded
Bust a canon 'cuz it's the last man standin'
"Whatever it takes, how ever it got's to go down
4 mics on stage a motherfuckin' 4 pound"
P of Mobb Deep, hell on earth
Last man standing
"Whatever it takes, how ever it got's to go down
4 mics on stage a motherfuckin' 4 pound"
P of Mobb Deep, hell on earth
Last man standing
