I need some time to ease my mind
I need some time to ease my mind
I need some time to ease my mind
I need some time to ease my mind
Trusted in a world that I don't know
From my mamas lips between my mamas hips
I'm cuddled by her hands because she understands
It's that bond that keeps the movement movin' on
Life is surrounded with so many insecurities
Back stabbin' is like breathing when in poverty
I try to make my sanity, with the insane
God is secondary to most, when they scrap for money
But, then again money can cause even more death
When a African becomes a nigger step an' fetch an' all
I dare say when price is right you can buy us all
Well not me, 'cause I don't truly give a care about it
I'll move in poverty, in wealth but I'll surely move
Ain't syncopated with your beats or your wack grooves
My break beat is to break away from yo thang
All these things you put on me makes this brother sing
I need some time to ease my mind
I need some time to ease my mind
I need some time to ease my mind
I need some time to ease my mind
I need some time to ease my mind
I need some time to ease my mind
I need some time to ease my mind
I need some time to ease my mind
Mind and soul is even more important and then body
Money can put my body in all exotic spaces
Meanwhile my mind and soul remotely dwells
Within that fine spot between all messed up and hell
And so I move on with confidence of harmony
And do my thang to resist this wack society
'Cause if you don't resist, and I mean consciously
You'll fool your sub conscious into accepting it
I ain't acceptin' it, I keep my focus
I keep my focus,  I ain't acceptin' it
Give me a face pencil to draw a smile on me
Answer my prayer to give my earthly body inner peace
Answer my prayer to give my earthly body inner, inner peace
Until that day upon which my souls released kingdom come
I need some time to ease my mind
I need some time to ease my mind
I need some time to ease my mind
I need some time to ease my mind
I need some time to ease my mind
I need some time to ease my mind
I need some time to ease my mind
I need some time, yeah
Need some time
