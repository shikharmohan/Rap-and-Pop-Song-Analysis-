I'm with a hundred and one niggas, we Dalmatian doggy deep
And fly with the tongue so if you feelin froggy leap
Kermit you better think before you ribbit
Don't be murdered over your song before you ad-lib it
I pop up like Xzibit
But givin' I'm at your crib it's
Not to put no fuckin' fish tanks in your Civics
Fuck getting your ride pimped
You'll get hog-tied whipped
Have you in the trunk curled up like fried shimp

Cause your boy just stay above the game

Leave you sloppy like seconds
Obey me like peasants
Or get opened up like presents
