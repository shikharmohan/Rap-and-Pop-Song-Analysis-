Buy a nickel bag, smoke a little lye
Get high tonight, get high tonight
Buy a nickel bag, smoke a little lye
Get high tonight, get high tonight
Buy a nickel bag, smoke a little lye
Get high tonight, get high tonight
Buy a nickel bag, smoke a little lye
Get high tonight, get high tonight
Before I set it off and show what I'm gonna do to ya
Possess the bomb chocolate from off Lynden and Utica
My real live niggas in the place and no queen
Wave your splif high, son, fuck the bullshit
When your arms are open, my palms release the bomb
Reviving the alarm, my word is bond, scream at niggas
Through the intercom, up to date, let's roller skate, yo, my whole squad
Smoking, ain't straight unless we smoking at eight, high rate
I always produce the potion, weed smoking got me
Moving slow motion like we floating on relax ocean
All my peeps who feel high, don't want you darking shades
There's to much smoke up in your eye
Keep it swinging, listen to all of my bells ringing
My get high has niggas wanting to start singing
I said this goes out to those that smoke out the bong
And all my bitches in the place who roll they own draws
Buy a nickel bag, smoke a little lye
Get high tonight, get high tonight
Buy a nickel bag, smoke a little lye
Get high tonight, get high tonight
Yo, bounce back, you just caught the contact African black
Overreact charge, I'm 'bout to bench the whole wack
Must interact on every track, blow this spot down
Niggas, break fool and smoke across the world almanac
My sons that don't smoke and get high drinking Cognac
Hennessey, Cristal but wait, what's going on with dat?
With the deal done sometimes, I sip Jamaican white rum
Taste with a little milk, I know y'all niggas want some
Represent where you from needing some tic tacs and gum
So a nigga breath don't blah, get high then I get fly
When I be shopping at the atrium, smoking in the center
Of Yankee Stadium, stand strong, yes, we rock on and on
The Flipmode stamps all of my songs
They get a place them niggas must perform
Smoke till your brain fry, so high
You can't open your eye, my niggas need to just
Buy a nickel bag, smoke a little lye
Get high tonight, get high tonight
Buy a nickel bag, smoke a little lye
Get high tonight, get high tonight
Buy a nickel bag, smoke a little lye
Get high tonight, get high tonight
Buy a nickel bag, smoke a little lye
Get high tonight, get high tonight
Buy a nickel bag, smoke a little lye
Get high tonight, get high tonight
Buy a nickel bag, smoke a little lye
Get high tonight, get high tonight
