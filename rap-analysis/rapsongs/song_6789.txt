Yo, aye Timbo, this your Crippin' cousin Snoop Dogg, cuzz

To the L.A. Zoo, take these *** to the L.A. Zoo
Yeah *** 'bout to get ape *** crazy in here
One time, dig this

Let me step up in this motherf*** 'til I get it right
I need a light
Let me lean, make it bright, everything is dynamite
Bust a ***, tryna feel like a pimp would
It's Snoop D O Double G, I'm in your neighborhood
I make it crack-a-lack, do it just like that
Take a sip of this, *** have a puff of that
You had enough of that? Yeah, give it right back
Now lay your head back and roll in the Cadillac
How we do what we do, what it is, where it's goin' down?
And the motherf*** flip it
Rip it, get specific and dip it and then they drip it
'Cause you know we like to pop it 'cause you talkin' so different
Fix your focus and ride, I want the bangers to bang
Or get hyphy with my *** up north by the Bay
Tryna twist in my whip, I got the big body Benz
'Cause I'm rollin' with my nephew and we smokin' again
Turn your music down low, man, your *** too loud
What the *** you talkin' 'bout? I put my *** in your mouth ***

Let me get a light, let me get a light
Yeah, better get it right
Let me get a light, homey, let me get a light
To get it right I gotta get a light
Whoa, to get it right I gotta get a light
To get it right I gotta get a light
No, to get it right I gotta get a light
Hip hop, I ball like a split end
I'm all like I been in, I'm tryna put my bid in
Rip ride and try to keep it all hidden
Slide to the left and let your G homey get in
Gloccs of Velveeta, yep, I'm off the meter
Ride by and see you with my hands on a h***
Wanna be like the O but you act like a ***
Gotta lot of Patron with a shot of the malt
Wannabes wanna beef like nine '99
You wanna battle me? You better learn how to rhyme
Boys stop tweakin' 'fore I light up the place
What he say? Who you talkin' 'bout? I'm right in your face
Aye, aye, baby girl, you know we hit the coot a lot
Me and my nephews, yeah, we stayin' true to life
They get the party live, Dogg is the motivator
Rockin' the block socket and knockin' down the player haters
Yeah, you better know
It's incredible, unforgettable
Yeah, I bet I'm slow and I bet I'm low
We at the L.A. Zoo, I'm whylin' out like an ambulance
Better get it right
Let me get a light, let me get a light
Yeah, better get it right
Let me get a light, homey, let me get a light
To get it right I gotta get a light
