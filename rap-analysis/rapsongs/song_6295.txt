Ah, to the beat y'all, yes, yes, y'all
Salt-N-Pepa's here with a brand new call
People are saying, "No, it just can't be them"
But yes, it's Salt-N-Pepa on the mic again
Here to let you know how the rhymes just go
When it's time to pick up the microphone
And let the voice flow, so yo Steevee-o, let the beat go
Whether it's fast or slow or medium tempo
No one can ever flow smooth as this
Whether he's a mister or she's a miss
So come one, come all, ya gotta bust a sound
Or rather the rhyme will just gather around
To see the doper than dope ones, fulfill the circumference
Go out and buy an amp so that you can pump this
It's startin' to irk me, yo, Salt, what irks you?
Other MC's couldn't fill up a circle with fans
While we were on vacation you couldn't complete your end
Salt-N-Pepa now we're back and again featuring
Spinderella, she's not a fella but a pro
And on the wheels of steel, good to go
Cuttin' up a storm, sometimes it's frightening
First comes the rain then strike the lightning
Doper than dope, can anyone cope? Yes
Maybe, ah, nope, so why do you persist and try?
Look me right in the eye and tell me are you that fly?
That you can pick up the microphone, we stake the mic alone
Hope that you never run into Salt-N-Pepa
'Cuz we're doper than dope, doper than dope, doper than dope
Yo, it's been a long time but now we're back
Salt-N-Pepa's gettin' funky on a brand new track
And more up to par, swift like a car
Stickin' to your mouth like rooftop tar
Leaving a scar on those who spar, so pass the cigar
Or get a drink from the bar, lyrics gonna flood your mind
Like a reservoir, here they are, come and join the Salt-N-Pepa
Seminar, the rhymes are refined, some call them bizarre
But they can catch your ears like a bass guitar
And speakin' of base, why did ya in the first place?
Walkin' around town till I see you face to face
You didn't wanna speak so I rested my case
And now you're feelin' kinda fragile like an antique vase
But don't worry friends or even give up hope
'Cuz this time we're hyper than hype on the mic
Call us doper than dope, doper than dope
Spinderella, where ya at? Give us a funky scratch
This is it, this is it, gettin' doper than doper than
Dope can get, uh, hit me two times
Three, two, one break down, ya broke up
'Cuz you started speakin' when you shouldn't have spoke up
You went the wrong way, you shouldn't have tried
To dis Salt-N-Pepa 'cuz half steppers gettin' fried
'Cuz these females at five minutes a beat
Is all it takes for us to take control seven days a week
You're wack, stick to your skeezin' please
And let's not waste time on the weak MC's
'Cuz they're unreal and we're the real deal
'Cuz we reveal the real sex appeal
Yo fellas, you want some, come and get some
Doper than dope rhymes, so I can hit some
Musical notes that can hypnotize
Keep your eyes on the lips, hips and thighs
Try to concentrate on the whole scenery
'Cuz this is Salt and the Pepa MC
Yo, here to rock right with the idol makers clan, there's Steevee-o
Hurby the luv bug and also The Invincibles, Fat Doug
Dre and Bougie and much more, so get your VCR
And pick my Fuji tape and rush for your house
Don't move slow 'cuz you might miss the main idols
In the video, you guessed it, yes it's no joke
Salt-N-Pepa's on the mic gettin', what?
Gettin' doper than doper than doper than dope
Enough, why? 'Cuz this ain't your average stuff
And when it comes to rockin' rhymes, Salt-N-Pepa don't bluff
We were the show stoppers that took your men
We made you shake it then you push it and we started a trend
But this trend is kinda different, it's not a gold rope
This time it's Salt-N-Pepa, Spinderella gettin' doper than dope
Doper than dope, doper than dope, doper than dope
Doper than dope, doper than dope
