Check this out
I was hangin' out late, creepin' a quarter to two
Polly with cats, sippin' on a 40 of brew
Pulled out the Dutch Master, 'cause it's time to get on
Turned on the truck system to pump a hip-hop song
Five minutes later I see these other kids clockin'
Meanwhile, my niggaz calmed out with system rockin'
Sayin' in my mind, "Who could it be?"
As he got closer, I peeped, it was the E-Double E
I said, "Whassup Duke?"
Yo, whassup Sundullah?
I have a girl and she wants me to duke her
Yo, why didn't you?
Yo, I woulda hit the skins
That's when I chilled, and peeped the two heads in the Benz
Gave my crew dap and hopped the right the fuck on in
E-Double set it
Yo P, this is Sandy and Lynn, Duke
I said yo, "What's the deadly yo?" She said, "Sex, you wanna feel yo?"
Lift her skirt with no panties, felt the familio
Lookin' half Phillipines, mixed with black in the genes
Had to drop the windows, to release the steam
Jane Jane
Oh, what a nice name
Looked her up and down, said, "Hmm, I'll take her"

Shorter than short and petite, blazin' ass body and physique
Five-doggin' it, pumpin' Jay-Z and Memphis Bleek
Burnin' somethin', purple chronic, orange or Thai
On the expressway, 495 L.I.
Straight rollin', nice from the Henny before
Shorty wanted to pull over and get a Dutch from the store
We parked the Benz, the girls got out and walked right in
Copped a 40 and a Dutch, and hopped right back in
Tried to pull off, that's when a squad car cut us off
Five-oh pulled out and said, "Chill, 'cause it's the law"

Aiyyo they caught us on a techno
(Techno)
Girls started shakin', gettin' petrol
Pulled the burner 540, one shot, sun screen's essential
Straight dumpin', no love for the badge and the gun
Straight accomplices, now our ass is on the run
Now shit's drastic, dodgin' and dippin' traffic
Bitches started regulatin' on some flash and blast shit
She's out the Benz with the quickness, that's when the shit got real
Bitches flipped, hit PMD with the steel
And asked him how it feel, jumped right back in grabbed the wheel
Told the cats to relax and yo, peep the deal
Remember Tommy Twotime, who used to move moonshine?
Now he's a bitch nigga, frontin' for cats, droppin' dimes
Yo, time to see him, he be hangin' at the coliseum
Down on 48th and Lex, near the black museum
He owe me somethin', when I see him, I'm straight dumpin'
Catch him four times in the legs, get close and ask him somethin'
Yo whattup God? 'Member J, from the schoolyard?
Try to floss when I was chillin', hold this baby pah
I looked at E like, "Yo, this bitch is talkin' like a dude"
Seen the cat across the street, she said, "It's time to move"
Ran up on him, he looked like he saw a ghost
Tried to run, but J pulled out and flashed the toast
Toast told him to bend over, and then the girl lift her dress
Pulled out a dick, laced him in the ass, and asked him
How he liked it, kid was cryin' in pain
'Member you raped me in the park? Peep, the crying game
Shocked, snap the hammer
Aiyyo the kid fell slow
I coulda swore he said, "Yo, don't do it Jane"
