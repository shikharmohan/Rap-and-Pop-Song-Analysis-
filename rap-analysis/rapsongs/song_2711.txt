If, you move, I'll fall
I'm leanin' on you, you baby, you baby
Geto Boys, Willie D
We was livin' on cold facts, cops sat in old 'Llacs
Couldn't get along with T Jones, so he rolled jack
I was on Prozac before I was 12
Spent my senior year in high school, sittin' in jail
To no avail, I was screamin' out and nobody heard me
Messed around and got shot but it didn't deter me
I think I was 14, so my boy was one trey
Cut my hair one day, left my crib and got sprayed
And expired right away, nuttin' to say, sad chapter
Around here, either you get killed or you get captured
Sister girl, I ain't know what you was dealin' wit
Pointed the finger at you, now I'm feelin' like an idiot
But I'm wiser now and I seen the world
It's messed up, how they treat us Geto Boys and girls
The doctors tried to resucessitate, it was too late
I got a daughter named Kain and a son named Blank
And they be askin' 'bout you, all the time
I try to be a better man, sometimes I fall behind
So if you feel some extra weight on you, don't be alarmed
Don't move, don't flee, that's me  leanin' on you
I'm leanin' on you
Y'all wonder why I act crazy, life don't phase me
For me to still be above ground it's just amazing
Wasn't aware bein' different gave me intangible wealth
That's why I, took a gun and tried to kill myself
My folks got the blame of course, I used to ask
Why did God make my brother so tall and me a dwarf?
This ain't no 'Poor little me song' that's so phony
I got a good life, I'm just sharin' my testimony
But could you imagine bein' me, for one hour, one day
One week, one month, one year? Get out of here
You'd never make it, life's not fair
Everywhere you go, people point, people laugh, people stare
They don't care, so I don't care, most of the day
I feel awkward but I believe I'm goin' to hell if I don't pray
As I laid, on that hospital gurney, fightin' for my life
I felt the demons touch my body then I saw the light
That was you, I know it was you
'Cause all the love in the world from my family couldn't pull me through
Lord, when it gets really rough
You're the only one that's strong enough to hold me up
That's why I lean on you
I'm leanin' on you
You're my one and only friend, ever since I was a kid
We've been in and out through thick and thin, tryin' to get a win
Broke as fuck on the corners like a nigga had diplomas
Back in 1985, skippin' class, gettin' high
Fat Turner we were walkin', I remember you was talkin'
'Bout this lick we was supposed to hit and turn us all to bosses
So we took that trip to Austin, and we came back with this package
That would later turn this strongest friendship into us scrappin'
Ain't too sure about what happened, all I'm knowin' is it was money
Had a nigga wagin' war against who I thought was the homey
Shoulda known this shit was evil, by the way it did my peoples
And the whole entire neighborhood fucked up behind this needle
Now we roam in the Regal, windows tinted, dem bangin'
Pistol grip on the frontseat, smokin' and steady drankin'
Drunk and I'm steady thankin' we probably shouldn't left it
'Cause every time that a nigga drops a record you arrested
It's depressin' but life and it's lessons'll leave us guessin'
Gettin' out, was a blessin' but lately a nigga stressin'
Which leads me to this question, was money the only reason we feuded
'Cause now that we got it, homey let's keep it movin', let's move
I'm leanin on you
I'm leanin on you
