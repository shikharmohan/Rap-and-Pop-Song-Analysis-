Sexy noises turn me on and on
Talk to me and you can't go wrong
I love the sound of your voice when you make love to me
And you caress my lips with your tongue
Love it when you whisper down my ears (oooo  baby)
Love it when you breathin' down me face (oooo  baby)
Love it when you rub down me spine (oooo  baby)
Love it when we drink white wine (oooo  baby)
Sexy noises (talk to me) really turn me on (tell it to me, baby)
Sexy noises (talk to me) really do turn me on (tell it to me, baby)
Sexy noises (talk to me) really turn me on (tell it to me, baby)

Now tell me, baby, how many hints must I make before you get the picture
That I like it when you talk to me? You say it loud what you say
Don't shy away, say it to my face, talk sweet to me
Go up and down and go round and do all that
But don't forget that I'm a sister with a thing for the sound
So make a sexy noise when you're on your way down
Yeah, all the way down
Sexy noises (talk to me) really turn me on
(I love it when you talk to me)

Do anything you like, and do it just how you like it
But when you feel you wanna scream, baby, don't fight it
'cause everytime I hear the noise comin' from your lips
You're gonna feel the rotation in my hips
'cause it's that sexy noise that moves me
And don't stop the lyrics if you don't wanna lose me
Because I wanna know, lover, if I'm doin' it well
But if you don't yell, brother, how can I tell?
Sexy noises turn me on and on
Talk to me and you can't go wrong
I love the sound of your voice when you make love to me
And you caress my lips with your tongue
Now Missy Pepa say she wanna have fun
She comin' down me house and ????
I love it when she caress me ears with her tongue
Cannot find words to tell her "Oh, me have fun"
And everytime she touch me and she start rub me down
It drive the body crazy when she make sexy sound - like that!

It's just me and you, and ain't nobody else down
So what's up, big man, give it to me right now
You wonder why I faint and swing with ya, don't ya?
