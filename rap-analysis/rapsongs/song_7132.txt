[chorus]
people see me in the street now
they wave at me and they ask me turn my beat down
turn my beat down, turn my beat down
i tell  em never i forever let my beat pound
[verse 1]
i keep my speakers in the trunk just like that yay
everybody where im from like that like that bass
just cant wait till i get a whoopty just to ride through the hood
buy theyself an amp and hook some woofers up to it
if your motor running good and your 808 bumpin 
thats all that really matter you cant tell a nigga nothing
nevermind what you ride when its dark outside
when theres broads outside, you just park outside
pop your trunk and cut your music up loud
now watch em crowd around bet they dig a nigga now
and my beat down low and my top laid back
now cut it to the max like i never said that (hey)
[chorus]
people see me in the street now
they wave at me and they ask me turn my beat down
turn my beat down, turn my beat down
i tell  em never i forever let my beat pound (hey)
police ask to turn my beat down 
he let me go, i turn the corner let my beat pound
turn my beat down , wont turn my beat down
I tell em never i forever let my beat pound
[verse 2]
when my girl ride with me, gotta cover my seat
cuz that thang go to skeetin, when i cut up my beat
pumpin something Grand Hustle in a 96 bubble
even amplify my tweeters so my music aint muffled 
your ass in trouble if u pull up next to me
when its really up high you can't hear yourself think
cause my speaker box the biggest trunk sound like a midget
tryna get up out of there 15's stay hittin
we be coming from a distance out of everbodys vision
it don't matter what im playing, i make everybody listen
see im turning around wondering how i get so loud
ears ringing all day cuz my shit so loud
[chorus]
people see me in the street now
they wave at me and they ask to turn my beat down
turn my beat down, turn my beat down
i tell em never i forever let my beat pound
police ask me turn my beat down 
he let me go, i turn the corner let my beat pound
turn my beat down , wont turn my beat down
I tell em never i forever let my beat pound
[verse 3]
when i pull up to the light and my shit so high

[chorus]
people see me in the street now
they wave at me and they ask me turn my beat down
