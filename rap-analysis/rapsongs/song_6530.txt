The hyper y'all get the harder I spit
And won't stop until they start a fight in this bitch
When I touch the mic I set the bitch on fire
Who say they harder? They are motherfuckin' liar
I touch the stage the crowd go crazy
The devil raised me, you motherfuckers can't fade me

Close your mouth bitch, dogghouse bitch
Whatchu thought motherfucker? We gon' stay rich
Well, the sayin' goes, we slangin' hoes
While y'all be payin' hoes, we g'd up
And we pushin' these pony-ups
And the heat goes where the homie goes

We ship 'em, give it to the world
Sell it to the fuckin' record stores
Tell the fuckin' haters to shut up
'Cause it still ain't No Limit
I know they thought this was the last meal
But they don't realize it ain't the last deal Snoopy
It's me and you baby, let's toast to success
Dogg house, No Limit, to the fuckin' world man
Last meal on that puta, you fuckin' cockroaches
