Now this goes out to all area clicks
Centralized and way out in the sticks
Remember to keep the De La in the mix
Just like log cabin syrup my sound is game thick
Now this goes out to all area clicks
From manicured lawns to projects bricks
Remember to keep the Mos Def in the mix
Straight butter hits, drop as a good as it gets
Now, come on y'all, get live get down
What we have is a brand new sound
So don't none of y'all just be misled
The De La's gonna do the body good like wheat bread
Shakin' laces out of shoes, Mos Def bought the brews
Sittin' Indian squats to make that red tie knots
See I'm out to get the core like in them Rainbow Pops
Swingin' life like a hammock, invested like stocks
Via sinus complex, I aims to clog it up
Snappin' by the pain as a crew hear the gain
We remain on your mind like skulls, not a golem
I'ma show it in the house all perimeters are blown
Native Tongue come through to make you say yes yes
This is the body Mos Def style fresh like baby breath
We are the killer combination with the size to administer
The beatdown to swell up all three of your eyes
Now this goes out to all area clicks
Centralized and way out in the sticks
Remember to keep the De La in the mix
Just like log cabin syrup my sound is game thick
Now this goes out to all area clicks
From manicured lawns to projects bricks
Remember to keep the Native Tongue in the mix
Straight butter hits, drop as a good as it gets
Now check it out and ya don't stop
We got the big brother beat, ya don't stop
Now check it out and ya don't stop
We got the big brother beat, ya don't stop
I don't bug out I chill, don't be actin' ill
No trick in ninety-six, Native Tongue gon' build
But we be easy on the cut, no mistakes allowed
'Cause to me, MC mean, make it clean
When I speak on groups and I'm smooth like Gabba D
Tryin' to hang out with Dove and catch love in Aberdine
I bag dimes like my man born on August 17
Life be nuttin' but a river son I'm swimmin' upstream
Playin' wait up, with the data servin' your ears
With information due to confirmation of the nation's most
Wicked ways of livin', like them glassy eyed beans
Inhale to smoke the fiends, while bangin' a table
Rated at the high point of the mass
Rippin' MC's at the top of a class, occasionally
Rippin' some sucker's face or some suckable ass from a girl
It's a big brother beat for the wide wide world
I'm makin memos off these demos back in eighty-nine
Took you all on encounters of an unknown kind
Did the hustle with a couple of us, but soon noted
That my niggaz buttered Benedict rolls, and then voted
I wrote in the dark so I could feel it like Braille
Heard the big brother beat, got locked with no bail
Came to set like equators invented, with the heat
Yo Mos Def how you radiate to make it complete
Right, so when I shine the light crabs wince
Manifestin' for the future here in the present tense
No doubt, I love the sound biggin' out off your Jeeps
Son, I want the little kids bangin' big brother beats
Now this goes out to all area clicks
Centralized and way out in the sticks
Remember to keep the Native Tongue in the mix
Just like log cabin syrup my sound is game thick
Now this goes out to all area clicks
From 718 to the 51-6
Remember to keep the De La in the mix
We straight butter hits, straight butter hits
We straight butter hits, we straight butter hits
Perfecta, perfecta
We straight butter hits, we straight butter hits
Perfecta, perfecta
We straight butter hits, we straight butter hits
Perfecta, baby
