This can't be it man, this shit is stressful
Is that what it is? I'm just successful
Maybe I'm too good to hood, low down no good
I just keep shit real like you should
Twist my fingers, throw up my hood
Let's get this money, I know I would
I know that's right but still we do wrong
J-bo got thirty but still we moved on
Get them clamps out, get my groove on
I stay iced out, get my cool on
Best be cool homes, get my goin' on on
I'll bust them to homes, get my lose on
Let's talk about hate 'cause I get allot of that

They say young fell off, yeah the boy done lost it
Been porting all my life, baby, I'm just exhausted
I take a Gatorade break to get everything straight
Now I'm sittin' here like how much Gatorade  make
How much money would it take to make some more money?
Damn right, a nigga straight come get some more from me
I sold millions, made them millions
But still you doubt me, what's this without me?
Can't be that bad, still got my trap swag
And every time I do a show I leave with a trap bag
Money in trash bags, I call that garbage
Twenty thousand a trash bag, it looks like garbage
Let's talk about hate 'cause I get allot of that

I get allot of that, allot of this, I need allot of it
Sit on my bedroom floor counting all of it
That money be ludicrous, it just might shock you
If you can't find chaka then my right hands keep it
Look, I am simply one of the best
Can't even lie, I can't vouch for the depressed
Just like zip lock, they get killed in the plastic
Best add five grams so you can weigh it in plastic
I am so dirty, they wrap me in plastic
When they wrap me in plastic need to put me in traffic
They say that I'm difficult, even different
Show me the difference, I'll bring you the difference
Let's talk about hate 'cause I get allot of that
Then we can talk about money 'cause I get allot of that
I get allot of that, I get allot of that
I get allot of that 'cause I get allot of that

And I seen allot of that and I got allot of that
