You inside the line of this *** experience for the 2000 plus C.I.S
Oh, we still in it, dig this, pimp time
She was the type of girl to play
(Which one of you *** like me?)
I met her just the other day
(Which one of you *** like me?)
She really didn't wanna gimme no play
(Which one of you *** like me?)
As I walked off, she just turned away
(Which one of you *** like me?)
I saw you hangin' with your friends
(Which one of you *** like me?)
They was lookin' at my friends
(Which one of you *** like me?)
But which one of y'all was checkin' out
This pimped out playa

Baby, I seen your homegirls jockin' my ride
And ooh, baby, which one of y'all will step off inside
And roll away with me?

I was tryna livin' a delight
(Which one of you *** like me?)
Then this skinny girls was everywhere
I had to stop, pause and fix my hair
Hand me my mirror, Joral
She was big but she was cute
(Which one of you *** like me?)
And I know that she had major moves
(Which one of you *** like me?)
It really didn't matter what she weighed
See 'cause a big girl loves to play
And play a playa playa, hey

Who wanna ride in a pimped out Cadillac?
I say, hey delicious, you look sweet like candy
I gotta ride shotgun with a bad *** in the back
No matter what you see or baby, what you saw
If you stand tall, we gon' ball through it all
And if the police come, don't let me take a fall
Please stuff this *** in the crotch of your drawer
  (Which one of you like me?)
She was a major ***, so unforgettable
Last time I see her though, I'ma let her know

Doin' thangs, holdin' hands, makin' plans, help me sing
We been drinkin', havin' fun, me and you, one on one
Doin' thangs, holdin' hands, makin' plans, I'm your man
Which one of you *** like me?
