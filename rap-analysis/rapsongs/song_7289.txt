Ay, what's haapnin'?
All you haters should get at me
'Cause I hear ya and I'm watchin'
But I'm serious, haters so all I gotta say is
What up? What's haapnin'?
All you haters can get at me
'Cause I hear ya and I'm watchin'
But I'm still here, I ain't stoppin'
So what up? What's haapnin'?
All you haters should get at me
'Cause I hear ya and I'm watchin'
But I'm serious, haters so all I gotta say is what up?
What it is bruh? What it do mayne?
Still the man from Japan to the blue flame
Still gettin' dough and make it rain with the loose change
I bet that what he did a show, now that's a damn shame
I guess that what he hatin' for, boy you so damn lame
Ya click the same, a destined bunch of walkin' shit stains
Disgraced the A, ya give the city such a bad name
You way back in my rearview mirror, I'm in the fast lane
Yet still I hear ya loud and clear on ya lil' song
Go on getcha dissin' on while the king gone
Your self-esteem gone 'cause I'm back now
Let's see if we can't teach these niggas how to act now
Ya kissin' ass then, ya jumpin' back now
I check ya ass then, I shut ya ass down
And I deliver front and center, never back down
Who get the last laugh now sucka nigga
What up? What's haapnin'?
All you haters can get at me
'Cause I hear ya and I'm watchin'
But I'm still here, I ain't stoppin'
So what up? What's haapnin'?
All you haters should get at me
'Cause I hear ya and I'm watchin'
But I'm serious, haters so all I gotta say is what up?
I got a front street swag and a side street hustle
Center Hill, Cedar Ave., that's where I be sucka
South Grand Church Street, the first with the work
But we can get it to commercial, if ya need somethin', chirp me
Hey, what I care 'bout who you assholes sayin' they ain't heard of me
I'm certified, certainly, them videos ain't hurtin' me
I still ride with the window rolled down
All around the A-town like it's finna go down
If it was ever any questions, niggas finna know now
Won't retire my throne or surrender no crown
I never bow down and never say die
Just to whom it may concern and whosoever may try
I'm forever West side and the featherweight dies
Tell 'em take your best shot, gon' an' get yourself high
'Cause I yell 'Bankhead' and you felt left out
I ain't mention yo' name, that's what all this 'bout?
What up? What's haapnin'?
All you haters can get at me
'Cause I hear ya and I'm watchin'
But I'm still here, I ain't stoppin'
So what up? What's haapnin'?
All you haters should get at me
'Cause I hear ya and I'm watchin'
But I'm serious, haters so all I gotta say is what up?
From Summer Hill to the Hills up in Hollywood
Our house full, gettin' to it, you know how we do it
Yeah, we smoke great and we drink good
Then we ball hard, just like G's should
Buy what we want, drive what we want
G4 up up and away we go, we fly where we want
Haters smile like they like it when they really don't
Wish they could just wish me away, that's what they really want
"I really hate his ass" "I don't like him either"
"We'll do a song together, maybe then we can beat him"
"Somehow he must be stopped, somethin' must be done"
"If we can't knock him off let's just try him when he get caught with guns"
"Then if he really done and we really won
Any more ideas? Suggestions anyone?"
"How 'bout we stay up all night, on the blog sites
Spread vicious lies and nasty rumors we could all write"
But that's alright, let the nerds hate
'Cause in my face though, them words gettin' ate
And hatin's hard work, when I just bounce back
This God's work, tell all the haters I'm back!
What up? What's haapnin'?
All you haters can get at me
'Cause I hear ya and I'm watchin'
But I'm still here, I ain't stoppin'
So what up? What's haapnin'?
All you haters should get at me
'Cause I hear ya and I'm watchin'
But I'm serious, haters so all I gotta say is what up?
