Verse 1:
(sung by slick rick)
Seems like yesterday
We used to rock the post
Makin love in the sheets
Like a ghost
Kissin and touchin
And holdin ya close
Kimberly Caire
you've got to know that
Love aint always
What it seems to be
Words can't express
What you mean to me
Even though you're gone
We're still a team
Through ya family
I'll forfill your dreams
In the future
Can't wait to see
If you open up
Your heart to me
Reminis some time
When they took ya Kim
'Try to black it out
But it plays again
When these tears
Are hard to concil
Can't imagine
All the pain I feel
Give anything
to hear half ya breathe
'cause I know that I'll still love you
'Till my death
Chorus:
Every breath you take
Every move you make
Every single day
Every bond you break
I'll be loving you
It's kinda hard
When your not around
To know your at yor window
Looking down
Believe me, girl
I cry for you
Every night
I cry for you
When these tears
Are hard to concil
Can't imagine
All the pain I feel
Give anything
to hear half ya breathe
'cause I know that I'll still love you
'Till my death
Chorus (2x)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, what
Snoop double, D O G, what, Mr. X to the Z, yeah and Kurupt
The kingpin, DoggHouse Records takin' over the shit in the '99
What, yeah, yeah, bangin' on you
It's the Big Bang Theory, yeah, check it out, bring it, yo
I got a Big Bang Theory, my hardcore committee
Gon' rock and roll the streets and shake the whole city
Chronic low ridin' bitches with silicon tities
We gon' bounce and ball until the wheels fall off
I got a Big Bang Theory, my hardcore committee
Gon' rock and roll the streets and shake the whole city
Affiliated with thousands walked out medallions
We gon' bounce and floss until the wheels fall off
Chest plates hit with gouges, sawed off, hauled off
Blast with somethin' and I breaks all the walls off
Fuck it, tie my flag around my mouth
Blue rag on my face, blue rag in my left pocket
Pistols screamin', unleashin' pure fury
Smash, snatch the pockets and all the jewelry
Glass shattering, blastin', niggas scatterin'
Scat, takin' three to four to the back
I'm back motherfucker, live broadcast
Show my face with my rag on, let me throw my hood in the air
Let me put 'bout two in the air
Let me show these motherfuckers that I don't care
It's a symphony composed of killers and armed forces
Livin' for whatever it cost's, crimp bosses
It's goin' down by the year 2 G
I'm goin' be flyin' through the hood, duckin', dodgin' the heat
My niggas watch the street, be it rain, snow or sleet
Us niggas gon' eat, makin' troops we creep
Losin' the jeep, runnin' on feet, survivin' off
The land money and gun in hand, operation quicksand
Ain't tryin' to put the mark of the beast on my hand
I had to bless the head of a military man
Jumped into the back of the 4 door sedan
All up in the trunk was the hidden contraband
Fuck a middleman, my pistols am directly from Iran
Looking from a third eye, I spot the hidden cam
I know what you look like, I know how you think
I'm the type of bitch to pop a pill up in your drink
I got a Big Bang Theory, my hardcore committee
Gon' rock and roll the streets and shake the whole city
Chronic low ridin' bitches with silicon tities
We gon' bounce and ball until the wheels fall off
I got a Big Bang Theory, my hardcore committee
Gon' rock and roll the streets and shake the whole city
Affiliated with thousands walked out medallions
We gon' bounce and floss until the wheels fall off
Bitch, fuck that, you bring fat rag, here's cheese
You work your fuckin' employees
You know you get all excited like that
Stack it through them hoodlum back 'cause I like it like that
Bitch, I kill drama, shit get action packed
When I jump out the black stealth bomber
'Cause it's 'bout, you know, I want the fuckin' mansion pad
To heal that bitch sittin' on
So don't hate the fuckin' cheese that you earn
Rotate the fuckin' weed that you burn
Don't fuck with Bossy off the glam
[Incomprehensible] rollin' crack, blow blocks in half
We rides on visitors and takes no prisoners
Handles all business and pay off the commissioner
Big time crime figure, niggas gettin' riches
20 inches whippin', all we givin' hittin' switches
Twistin', flippin' chickens, stickin' victims if they slippin'
Trippin' on the mission and my trigga finga itchin'
Positioned at your dome, one twitch and it's on
No remorse or second thoughts once the clip in the chrome
This is the zone, weak niggas covers get blown
Stoned killers and gorillas want whatever you want
Shake spots with bank nots, keep the thang cocked
And leave motherfuckers stripped to tank tops
We the gang, it's our thang to mash and maintain
Gang bang slang came and ain't gon' change
All out till we fall out, fuck the world
DoggHouse style with the chucks and curls
I got a Big Bang Theory, my hardcore committee
Gon' rock and roll the streets and shake the whole city
Chronic low ridin' bitches with silicon tities
We gon' bounce and ball until the wheels fall off
I got a Big Bang Theory, my hardcore committee
Gon' rock and roll the streets and shake the whole city
Affiliated with thousands walked out medallions
We gon' bounce and floss until the wheels fall off
