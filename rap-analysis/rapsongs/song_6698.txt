Hell yeah, that was a mothafuckin' trip
The way y'all niggaz had the whole world sayin'
Uh! Na, na, na, na, this here the Doggfather
Rappin' on this shit here, check this out
Let me here you say
Woof, mothafucker, woof, mothafucker
Bow wow wow, yippie yo, yippie yay
Woof, mothafucker, woof, mothafucker
Bow wow wow, yippie yo, yippie yay
I run with convicted felons, scream, yellin'
Bitch, I'ma soldier, stick in my chrome receiver
And I fins to get it on, influenced by the Dolja
Blastin' at the rollers, callin' couple of soldiers
Fuckin' up with this song, bitch
Your mom shoulda told ya, I ain't nothin' nice
Snoop brought the boss, I got the spark
Let's go on a body high, put it on my life
And my favorite Weed pipe, soldiers greed
With ice, watch me budda up in the night
Careful to ever, the one that bitch shot him
Bringin' the drama like a punk, but your fucking somebody
Whut, Lodi Dodi, send a duce up in Dey Coupe
But after a hard eight
Snoop and his soldiers gonna make ya say
Woof, mothafucker, woof, mothafucker
Bow wow wow, yippie yo, yippie yay
Woof, mothafucker, woof, mothafucker
Bow wow wow, yippie yo, yippie yay
Woof, mothafucker, woof, mothafucker
Bow wow wow, yippie yo, yippie yay
Woof, mothafucker, woof, mothafucker
Bow wow wow, yippie yo, yippie yay
Nigga, all I really wanna do is get down, on the get down
That mothafucker better sit down, we up in this bitch now
Got the take to make the hap, we gon' make our money right
Tired of livin' the stress life pressure, fuck price, yikes
Know what I like? Keep it hype, betcha I right
Put pounds of ice on you, like white on rice
Vise grips on the mics, turnin' to fights, burnin' up the limelight, fire
And you ain't gotta strain your eyes to find us
Throwin' bad days behind u, ah, damn, up in the headlights
'Bout to let it shine, find your ass in there tip toeing, your ass is mine
We got you waitin' for us on the radio
So our albums can drop, Snoop, Fiend, me
Beats By The Pound, you know that's gon' pop
Jump in the game in the walkway
With enough money to fuck with
'Til ya hear that last fuckin' woof, we ain't done yet
Let me here you say
Woof, mothafucker, woof, mothafucker
Bow wow wow, yippie yo, yippie yay
Woof, mothafucker, woof, mothafucker
Bow wow wow, yippie yo, yippie yay
Woof, mothafucker, woof, woof, woof, woof
Bow wow wow, yippie yo, yippie yay
Let me hear ya say
Woof, woof, woof, woof, woof
Bow wow wow, yippie yo, yippie yay
I come faster than a speedin' bullet
Or I can take my time and move it slow
Wake up, outta my seat and hit this mic
And blow like some indo
You can call me what you want
Please don't call me no punk
My name is Snoop D O double G
And I'm the godfather of G Funk
I'll put this shit down, like clown, Dogg Pound is my set
Nigga set outta line, I shoot them in they mothafuckin' spine
And break they necks, as I go down, you gon' realize that
See when you run up in my face
You able to get smacked, jacked, just like that
I'ma fool, break the rules, damn, way too cool
They call me Snoop D O double G
'Cause, I'ma fuckin' fool, I can get silly
But I'd rather sit back, relax, new jacks, get smacked
'Cause I'm tryin' to blaze up a sack
To my nigga Mystikal, Fiend, and my big homie Master P
'Cause that's just the way this shit gon' be
Baby, N O L I M I T,  we gon' make y'all say woof
Until you mothafuckers demand that nigga named Snoop
I can make 'em say
Woof, mothafucker, woof, mothafucker
Bow wow wow, yippie yo, yippie yay
Woof, mothafucker, woof, mothafucker
Bow wow wow, yippie yo, yippie yay
Let me here you say
Woof, mothafucker, woof, mothafucker
Bow wow wow, yippie yo, yippie yay
Woof, mothafucker, woof, mothafucker
Bow wow wow, yippie yo, yippie yay
Say woof, woof, woof, woof, woof
Bow wow wow, yippie yo, yippie yay
Say woof, woof, woof, woof, woof
Bow wow wow, yippie yo, yippie yay
And not only that and not only that
