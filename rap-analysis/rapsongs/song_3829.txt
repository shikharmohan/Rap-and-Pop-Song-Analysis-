Uhh Junior Mafia
Peace to all originals
Peace to all those gone
Yeah Junior Mafia the click, whoo
Blessed by the God, so I be the Earth's
Queen Bee Bitch, Poppa keep me rich
In gun tottin', keep floatin' in them automobiles
Pack with steel, engines filled with Benjamins
I got half a mill stashed in the boat station
For womanizers and 'em hand full of hoes that hate me
But lately, it seems people make the world go round
From A to Z, I break 'em down alphabetically
Pethtically, I puts the pressure
In ya Jones that you fall like a Motorol burner
Flip ya jacks and ya snitch ass back, to the cell of your block
H D M lock and I wish you would stop
All that baulin', cryin', lyin'
'Cause this black Queen is shinin'
You didn't know I was Lieutenant
Bitch, well that's primary
You just a secondary secretary, envy against me
Because I stay laced in Ellen Tracey, Dolce & Gabanna
And people love me for my style, my personal
Niggas got wow and once I have my chow
Bet I just sit back and enjoy, the optimism given from a girl to a boy
What's it all about
It's my time to shine, been down for much too long
I've gotta get mine, J M and Kim keep movin' on
It's my time to shine, been down for much too long
I've gotta get mine, J M and Kim keep movin' on
Yeah Junior Mafia click, yeah Junior Mafia
We all know what it means to be broke
Breaking niggaz off for some ends and weed smoke
Some like to mix it with coke
Trees I like 'em fine, straight up marijuin'
And I'm put the lent in ya dents
Then you'll be stressed out with no dollars and no cents
Dressed in gear from last year, that you bought
Before you quit ya job at the airport
Thinkin' you gon' make a mill from this rap game
But you labeled as a lame and it's a damn shame
No fame, no name, show no shame
Who's to blame, tore up in ya frame
Now you wanna lick a shot 'cause you ain't got
Get props, runnin' up in weed spots
Just a little gets to make game
So you put the steam and the jewels in the stash
Quick fast, get mad
'Cause ya man's in my whip, honey button ya lip
'Cause my click is too dense, it's all about the guns, the ones
Just another day that the Earth's used the Suns
It's my time to shine, been down for much too long
I've gotta get mine, J M and Kim keep movin' on
It's my time to shine, been down for much too long
I've gotta get mine, J M and Kim keep movin' on
Hey baby it's about time to shine we're movin' on
Keep it going strong, can't stop what's going on
Hey baby it's about time to shine we're movin' on
Keep it going strong, can't stop what's going on
It's my time to shine, been down for much too long
I've gotta get mine, J M and Kim keep movin' on
It's my time to shine, been down for much too long
I've gotta get mine, J M and Kim keep movin' on
