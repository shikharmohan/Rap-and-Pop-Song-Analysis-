You just popped in the Kanye West
"Get Right for the Summer" workout tape
And ladies if you follow these instructions exactly
You might bear to pull you a rapper, a NBA player
Man, at least a dude wit' a car
So first of all we gon' work on the stomach
Nobody wants a little tight ass!
1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and get them sit-ups right and
Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Give head, stop, breathe, get up, check your weave
Don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son and don't disrespect your seed
It's a party tonight and ooh she's so excited
Tell me who's invited, you, your friends and my dick
What's scary to me, Henny make girls look like Halle Berry to me
So excuse me miss, I forgot your name
Thank you, God bless you, good night, I came
I came, I came
It's been a week without me and she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but ain't nothin' to talk about
Unless she talk about freakin' out, then maybe we can work it out
Work it out, work it out, work it out, work it out now
Maybe we can work it out
Ooh girl your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set, Twista said get it wet
Ooh, girl your breath is harsh, cover your mouth up like you got SARS
Off them tracks yeah I bought them cars still kill a nigga on 16 bars
We ain't sweatin' to the oldies, we jukin' to a cold beat
Maybe one day girl we can bone so you can brag to all your homies now
But I still mess with a big girl, though you ain't fit girl I'll still hit girl
1 and you brought 2 friends, okay 3 more, now hop in the Benz
4 door, do you know the difference between a 5, 6, 7, 8?
All the mocha lattes, you gotta do Pilates
You gotta pop this tape in before you start back dating
Hustlers, gangstas, all us ballas
It's been a week without me and she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but ain't nothin' to talk about
Unless she talk about freakin' out, then maybe we can work it out
Work it out, work it out, work it out, work it out now
