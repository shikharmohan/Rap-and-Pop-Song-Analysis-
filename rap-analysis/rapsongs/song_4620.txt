What up brown skin, you're body smellin' like cinnamon
Hair in a bun, your toes done so feminine
Heard you suck your teeth like oh no here we go again
Let me get your name so I can be more genuine
No need to front, the kid knows you got many friends
Many mens who waiting to stake a claim on it
Put they name down just to spit some game on it
But fuck friends I'm trying to set the mood
You know, go at you hard like most records that's sold
Spit propaganda at you to you break down and fold
You look confused miss thing like I'm speaking in code
76-64 press pound hello
Are you listening now, did I get your attention
Undivided because you used to be undecided
Now you looking fluxed like those chicks with they nose stuck up
Just put your number down girl what the fuck
Hey yo, that's alright girl, what ever you say
What ever you say, what ever you say
Yo, that's alright girl, what ever you say
What ever you say, what ever you say
Don't worry 'bout it girl, what ever you say
What ever you say, what ever you say
Okay alright, what ever you say
What ever you say, what ever you say
Aiyo, I usually play the background, you know clean cut
Soft spoken well dressed dipped out straight chillin'
When I'm in the club yo, sipping the sprite with the
Ill lemon mixed in it sipping on it I was just chillin'
'Til I saw you that's when my heart stopped knees gave
Head sweating jaws locked I was sweating you
Like god damn girl, you got a nigga going buck wild
Mesmerized star struck I was thinking maybe we can go out
Like to the movies or the apple bees
Blockbuster state fair but you looked at me and
Said fuck that you just a herb with no money and
No jeep and no condo and I thought that Little Brother had a record deal
Okay I see where you going now
Want a sweat a nigga when you think he got a cash advance
And some personal time but fuck that I got your head still
Bobbing and my verse didn't rhyme, so it's what ever girl
Hey yo, that's alright girl, what ever you say
What ever you say, what ever you say
Yo, that's alright girl, what ever you say
What ever you say, what ever you say
Don't worry 'bout it girl, what ever you say
What ever you say, what ever you say
Okay alright, what ever you say
What ever you say, what ever you say
Check it so what I'm chubby, y'all chicks still love me
Like to rub on my tummy while I tell you something funny
Whispering in your ear till them panties go falling
What's my name, yeah that's what they be calling
Oh yeah, I know I'm husky but chicks still love me
3 o'clock still have they ass running to Waffle House fa me
Be feeling on that ass till me name they be calling
And shit got them so wet they make a Freudian slip and
Fall down into my verbal abyss that's straight Reservoir
Dog style perfecto served with a kiss muah baby
It's just like this no need to fight it
Invite it try me out you just might like it
American pie shit try anything out once
Forever stained in memory like white shirts and punch
I get the hunch that a niggas on your menu
Do mew a favor girl come check me at the next venue
Hey yo, that's alright girl, what ever you say
What ever you say, what ever you say
Yo, that's alright girl, what ever you say
What ever you say, what ever you say
Don't worry 'bout it girl, what ever you say
What ever you say, what ever you say
Okay alright, what ever you say
What ever you say, what ever you say

You go to your girls' house and I'm a go to mine
'Cause I know my girl is definitely mad
'Cause it took us too long to do this album
Yo, I hear what you saying
