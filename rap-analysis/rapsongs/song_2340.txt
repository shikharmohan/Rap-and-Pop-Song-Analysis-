Yeah, gangsta Dresta steps in this muthafucka
And this one goes out tah all the O.G.s out there
And I can't forget about the baby gangstaz, what's up, niggaz?
My nigga, they came back with some of that old school original
West coast shit, nigga that got all of y'all in this dig
In the first place, yeah, so run that shit E, yeah
Cruising down tha street in my '64
Jacking tha freaks, clocking tha dough
Went to tha park tah get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there come shooting some hoop
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rolling Kilo G
He rolled down his window and he started to say
It's all about making that GTA
'Cuz tha boyz n tha hood are always hard
Ya come talking that trash, we'll pull ya cord
Knowing nuthing in life but tah be legit
Don't quote me, boy 'cuz I ain't said shit
(Straight up, straight up, straight up gangsta)
(Wrong nigga tah fuck wit)
(Straight up, straight up, straight up gangsta)
(Wrong nigga tah fuck wit)
Dotomy's in tha place tah give me the pace
He said my man JD is on free-base
Tha boy JD was a friend of mine
'Til I caught him in my car trying tah steal a Alpine
I chase him up tha street tah call a truce
Tha silly cluckhead pulls out a deuce deuce
Little did he know, I had a loaded 12 gauge
One sucka dead, L.A. Times front page
'Cuz tha boyz n tha hood are always hard
Ya come talking that trash, we'll pull ya cord
Knowing nuthing in life but tah be legit
Don't quote me, boy 'cuz I ain't said shit
(Punk, punk muthafuckaz, like it ain't no thang)
(Punk, punk muthafuckaz, like it ain't no thang)
Bored as fuck and I wanna get ill
So I went to a place where my homeboyz chill
Niggaz out there making that dolla
I pulled up in my '64 Impala
They greet me wit a 40 and I start drinking
And from tha 8-ball, my breath start stinking
Enough tah get my girl tah rock that body
Before I left, I hit tha Bacardi
I went to her house tah get her out of the pad
Dumb hoe said something that made me mad
She said something that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed tha stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
She started talking shit, what did ya know?
Reached back like a pimp, slapped tha hoe
Her father jumped up and he started tah shout
So I bombed on Pops, knocked his old ass out
'Cuz tha boyz n tha hood are always hard
Ya come talking that trash, we'll pull ya cord
Knowing nuthing in life but tah be legit
Don't quote me, boy 'cuz I ain't said shit
(And if a brotha talks shit, I give him a)
(And if a brotha talks shit, I give him a)
(And if a brotha talks shit, I give him a)
Now I'm rolling hard, now under control
Them wrapped tha '64 around a telephone pole
I looked at my car and I said, "Oh, brother"
Thrown in the gutter and go buy another
Walking home and I see tha G-ride
Now Kat is driving Kilo on tha side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
A undercovered cop in a dark green Nova
Now Kat got beat for resisting arrest
He socked tha pig in tha head for ripping his Guess
Now he is caught for doing tha crime
For defense on tha boy, he'll do some time
'Cuz tha boyz n tha hood are always hard
Ya come talking that trash, we'll pull ya cord
Knowing nuthing in life but tah be legit
Don't quote me, boy 'cuz I ain't said shit
(I'll punk you like that, don't give a fuck)
(I'll punk you like that, don't give a fuck)
(I'll punk you like that, don't give a fuck)
(I'll punk you like that, don't give a fuck)
I went tah get them out but there was no bail
My niggaz caused a riot in tha county jail
Two days later in municiple court
Kilo G on trial, straight caught a fought
"Instruct him out tha court", said the judge
On a six year sentence, my man didn't budge
Bailiff came over tah turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out fire, then came Susie
Tha bitch came in wit a submachine Uzi
Police shot tha girl but didn't hurt her
Both up state for attempted murder
'Cuz tha boyz n tha hood are always hard
Ya come talking that trash, we'll pull ya cord
Knowing nuthing in life but tah be legit
Don't quote me, boy 'cuz I ain't said shit
