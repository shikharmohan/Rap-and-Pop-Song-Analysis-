Met jealous people, prayed I wouldn't make it
(Tell it)
But opportunity knocked, I had to take it

Never fake it, 'cuz I be down with the King
He's running everything, like the family
(So I sing)
When you feel the pressure and you stressed

I ain't trippin' over nothin', I count my blessings
(That's right)
Studyin' my words, steady tryin' to learn my lesson
(Uh-huh, yeah)
There's madness in this world
Check me out, I ain't stressin'
(Word)
Knowledge is the key
Joy and peace, the essence
(True that)
Do unto others, don't disrespect your mothers
Lend a helping hand to your sisters and your brothers
Trust God, uh, that's all you gotta do
He'll take care of you, now all praises due
All praises due to the Most High
(To the Most High)
To the Most High heed your prayer to the sky
(You gotta keep your head up to the sky)
So you wanna know why
Praise the Lord everyday, that's how I get high
I, uh, just get by
Can't do me nothin' 'cuz God is on my side
All praises due to the Most High
(To the Most Hight)
To the Most High heed your prayer to the sky
(You gotta keep your head up to the sky)
Said you gotta keep your head
I said you gotta keep your head up to the sky

He brought me through some hard times
It was mad, rough
(No doubt)
I thought I couldn't handle it
Uh, I had enough
But all praises due to the Most High
You kept me alive when I could have died
(Come on)
My God, I think I got to say, Halleluiah
You still loved me, when I never even knew Ya
