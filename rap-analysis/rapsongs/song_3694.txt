They slippin' duke, you slippin' duke, you trippin' duke
Remember, you still livin' in a corporate chicken coop
With a hundred other chickens yellin' get that loot
Makin' a hundred other chickens tryin' to spit what's cute
But KRS spits the fruit, my words are not hollow
I'll lead you out the chicken suit
You slippin' duke, I got proof, spit truth in the club
So the colleges man, we get so loose, what's the use?
You slippin' duke, how America great when Iraq had no nukes
Now oops, whatever happened to samples and loops?
The same thing that happened to organs and flutes and real artists
Thank God for The Roots, the soldier that's home with his family
Support for the troops, yeah, now let's start this
I've taught many groups, been through many suits
Teachin' new recruits that can't take it back to hula hoops
I know we're on mute, stand up straight
I'm like sky walker without the loot, you slippin' duke
At 8 you're a sucker, at 7 a motherfucker
Talk your talk, degrade my character
Your remarks are amateur, the future laughs at ya
I got much stamina and I know my facts
I am hip-hop, I don't speak for blacks
I speak for hip-hop's preservation and only that
Peace love unity, I'm known for that
What's your hassle with me, man? No man is ownin' me
You just mad 'cause I lead hip-hop globally
Your hassle is that, I'm an international cat
You know in any debate, I'm smashin' your crap
When it comes to hip-hop, you behind
'Cause I've been organizin' this politically since 1989
I stay selective, the objective peace of mind
I am hip-hop and so are you don't be so blind
Use the key next time, you know my roots
But listen, dog, you slippin' duke
You wanna hear a fresh rhyme, you'll come to the source
Stamp BDP on your head then you're off
At 8 you're a sucker, at 7 a motherfucker
Do not attempt to diss 'cause you're soft
