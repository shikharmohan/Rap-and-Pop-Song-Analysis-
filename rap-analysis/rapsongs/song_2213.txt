Righteous people be knowin' what I be doin'
Is protect my peoples million dollar spot
Uhh, that's right, uhh, my million dollar spot
My million dollar spot, my million dollar spot
My million dollar spot, on the block bring it hot
On the spot, my million dollar spot, uh
Major loot, seriously niggaz don't wanna dispute
Mysteriously a nigga die, when you play this game
And ain't know the time
I suck the life out your ass by pushin' mute
Shit can get stanky like a poot
I got dog poop crank, yes I pollute
Leave the whole block fully unrecouped
I'm like a record company, givin' out advancements
Get my money back, by any circumstances
My million dollar spot, not to mention
Drive through service, church's chicken
A bu-a-bucket full of acid by the do'
Just in case I gotta throw away my yole
Bars around the house, bars around the window
Dope around the corner, broken down Pinto
You can tell who got the mail who got the biggest chops
My million dollar spot
I can take a chance, I could live in cans
Bring it on the block, my million dollar spot
I can take a chance, I could live in cans
Bring it on the block, my million dollar spot
It was more than just a dream for me
To be the King it seems I need a killer team to get the green for me
Hit the scene clean in my Chevy, now I'm ready for trouble
Count my rocks, set up shop, collect my fetti and bubble
Faded visions of me as a timer
Though marijuana clouds my vision I'm still watch for drama, ha-ha
They got me crossed tryin' to be the boss, no one can stop us
Niggaz dream of six figures, handle our business in choppers
Feds can't comprehend my ghetto slang, so I evade
And plot and plan a life of better thangs, all about my chedder main
Help me if I fall, can I ball for life
A half a key in my drawers, bein' cautious like
I wanna rise keep my eyes open
Witness motherfuckers die with they eyes open
My niggaz rise smokin' any busta bitch tryin' to stop my wish
To have a million dollar spot gettin' riches, nigga
I can take a chance, I could live in cans
Bring it on the block, million dollar spot
I can take a chance, I could live in cans
Bring it on the block, million dollar spot
Nuttin' but the motherfuckin' hog in me
Hit the Hillside trapped with thirty-six O-Z's
Serve nothin' but doves, no twat no love
Now nigga don't make me get these burner gloves
I got the whole block jumpin' like the Mardi Gras
Nothin' but a dope fiend party y'all
I'm lovin' this game, it's my favorite sport
Come short get burnt with the Newport
I'm in the four O, and 'Pac came to see me
Smobbin' in a nine-six drop rose Bentley, shit be
Caution for these niggaz on the ocean
A sip of the potion now your nigga be in motion
Bossin' hopin' federal thieves don't raid
Catch me with a glock and a box of grenades
I'm tryin' to get paid, all about my lucci
Now bitch put this motherfuckin' key in your coochie
Motherfuckers hoe hard!
Ya understand that? Motherfuckers hoe hard!
We got shit jumpin' off on every spot
We got crank methamphetamines
Dope for ass to get yo' cash, motherfucker
We got big pimpin', ya understand
We got solicitin', ya know
We got all kind of shit, prostitution it don't stop
Motherfucker tryin' to just get his cash
On the motherfuckin' million dollar spot
I can take a chance, I could live in cans
Bring it on the block, my million dollar spot
I can take a chance, I could live in cans
Bring it on the block, my million dollar spot
