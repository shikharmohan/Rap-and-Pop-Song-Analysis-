It's a dog eat dog competition, no doubt
I'll be gone like you're wishin' an' I'm out
'Cause I ain't got time for hangin' around
When you're fuckin' my love in all the wrong places
It's a dog eat dog competition, no doubt
I'll be gone like you're wishin' an' I'm out
'Cause I ain't got time for hangin' around
When you're fuckin' my love in all the wrong places
It's a dog eat dog competition, no doubt
I'll be gone like you're wishin' an' I'm out
'Cause I ain't got time for hangin' around
When you're fuckin' my love in all the wrong places
It's a dog eat dog competition, no doubt
I'll be gone like you're wishin' an' I'm out
'Cause I ain't got time for hangin' around
When you're fuckin' my love in all the wrong places
Extra, extra, what's that all about?
I'm wishin' the position of my lovin's sorted out
I shed a tear 'cause I'm hearin' nothin' new or particular
Status once parallel, now it's perpendicular
An' everything is just as clear as day
Realistically explicit in the things you say
I guess a bitch in the batter's gonna make the flavor fatter
But you gots to keep it for real
Forget about your jewels an' gems
You won't be needin' none of them
The tool'll fix the era, my mellow used to wear a
Name buckle, now he chuckle 'cause he earn a dime quicker
Talkin' 'bout a burnin', sippin' on some malt liquor
An' all these kiddies wishin' they were supa emcees
But to earn my 'S', I had to learn some less
About a crime'll make million, a dime'll make a call
I'd rather hop on the line an' drop a rhyme to Prince Paul
It's a dog eat dog competition, no doubt
I'll be gone like you're wishin' an' I'm out
'Cause I ain't got time for hangin' around
When you're fuckin' my love in all the wrong places
It's a dog eat dog competition, no doubt
I'll be gone like you're wishin' an' I'm out
'Cause I ain't got time for hangin' around
When you're fuckin' my love in all the wrong places
Hey kid, what's the word? Man, it's all about mind
Keepin' focused on them self-mechanisms of rhyme
So no longer stand erect 'cause your thoughts are drained
Walkin' round manifestin' attributes of shame
Used to squabble for the mic but now accordingly
We act unless a club can't afford the fee
We act, so name that any best man to put us under
Created from the ground yet know nothin' 'bout the under
Take a glimpse at them pimps playin' record exec
Addin' up all your O's, so is to cut you a check
Sayin', "Why the blunder? Wonder could've G'd today"
So you can put up some swings for your seed to play
But a swing ain't that important
When the park's around the corner
Filled with life, causin' death
Greetin' victims for the mornin'
It was the moment I feared, nah, the moment I steered
Upon the right path to know the right math to over stand
It's a dog eat dog competition, no doubt
I'll be gone like you're wishin' an' I'm out
'Cause I ain't got time for hangin' around
When you're fuckin' my love in all the wrong places
It's a dog eat dog competition, no doubt
I'll be gone like you're wishin' an' I'm out
'Cause I ain't got time for hangin' around
When you're fuckin' my love in all the wrong places
It's a dog eat dog competition, no doubt
I'll be gone like you're wishin' an' I'm out
'Cause I ain't got time for hangin' around
When you're fuckin' my love in all the wrong places
It's a dog eat dog competition, no doubt
I'll be gone like you're wishin' an' I'm out
'Cause I ain't got time
No doubt an' I'm out, no doubt
