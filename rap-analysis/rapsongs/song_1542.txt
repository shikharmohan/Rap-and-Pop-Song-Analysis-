Ha, check it out
It's Bumpy Knuckles baby, also known as Freddie Foxxx
That's right, and I came to check my niggaz De La Soul
See y'all niggaz don't really wanna bust dat shit, huh
You know I'm sayin'? So I'ma show you niggaz
The super laser gamma ultra killa nigga special
You niggaz ain't no killers
You motherfuckers ain't gonna hurt nobody, nigga
You better keep rhymin', nigga
'Fore I smack the shit outta you, you little fuckin' sissy
You niggaz ain't real; that's right, it's De La Soul, baby
And Bumpy motherfuckin' Knuckles baby, alright, come on
Check my stats, entire apparat'
Even from the days when I had to roll strapped
Wonderin' if I gotta go back to that
Zest to rub records from rap and kick facts
To tracks and stack, one whole decade
Yeah some got paid, some waved in the fades
Fact of the matter my style will never fade
Managin' to keep it all A-grade
So you can stay nourish and flourish with the truth
[Incomprehensible] some niggaz, I know
If I need a mayday
Bust some fuckin' niggaz tryin' to play me crazy
Causin' interruptions to my big pay-day
Playin' with them guns make them fuckin' leary
But if it's clearly, merely and surely and, how it's gotta be
I got some thorough niggaz that's ridin' me
So witcha bullshit I'm not buyin' it B
Don't come around thinkin' you can try it with me
'Cause
You don't wanna bust dat shit
You don't wanna bust dat shit
You don't wanna bust dat shit
You don't wanna bust dat shit
You don't wanna bust dat shit
You don't wanna bust dat shit
You don't wanna bust dat shit
You don't wanna bust dat shit
Shick shick, click a click
This is where my people headin' at
Innocent people are carryin' gats
Now what the fuck is all that?
Is it 'cause times is live like a wire?
Gettin' shock treated by the crossfire
Ha-siyahh, burn bare well prepared
To make my decision for my livin'
I ain't the one 'Robin', I'm the one 'Given'
Hip hop driven, and willin' to die for it
When Scott LaRock died, man I cried and shit
Then some cats got rich callin' a woman a bitch
But ain't no woman like the one I got
And if you call her a bitch well you might get
And I know the feelings is mutual
It's uncivilized and unsuitable
Crips and bloods are recruitable
But you don't wanna bust dat shit
You don't wanna bust dat shit
You don't wanna bust dat shit
You don't wanna bust dat shit
You don't wanna bust dat shit
You don't wanna bust dat shit
You don't wanna bust dat shit

Waitin' for your father to come bail you out
