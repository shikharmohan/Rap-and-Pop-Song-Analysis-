Missy, huh, uh, we are like that
Uhh, it's the Q to the, B to the, double E spittin' lovely
And it don't stop, rocks shine through my tank top
Where your bank stop I deposit all the one drops, haa
Think not, excuse me but, uh, I like to flow
'Cause this joint knocks harder then Indicot
And I be off the wall like the Lox
Night box filled with Benjamins'
Me and my girl Missy gettin' pissy up in Bennigans
Makin' all of you other rappers begin again
Like Fennigan, Christians repent then sin again
Girls, wanna be my friend again
Lay up in my crib up wit get up in my linens and
While Misdemeanor hit notes like Sarafinna
I subpoena you to my funk grooves see
I hit you wit da haa, she hit you wit da hee
It wasn't your car that had me all in love with you
'Cause I've got my own ride and a trunk full of tunes, yeah
I drive through your hood
I hit 'em wit da hee, I hit 'em wit da, I stop 'em wit da, haa
Oh, let's drink to you and me, let's drink to you and me
Meet me at the bar, haa, hee, haa
It wasn't your money that had me all sprung out, sprung out
'Cause I got my own account and my bills in large amount
Hey, hey, hey, I drive through your hood
I hit 'em wit da hee, I hit 'em wit da, I stop 'em wit da haa
Let's drink to you and me, let's drink to you and me
Meet me at the bar, yeah, yeah, yeah
Long Iced Tea slurp me swiftly, meet me at the bar
What's up star? We know who you are
Shit, no shit, I thought you hadn't noticed
The way I roll this Dutch, the way I roll this Dutch
Niggaz, love my style too much, duck
Here comes the shot bang, bang, burr, drop
Me and Timbaland like haa, taking over blocks
Like a one billion bitch march
I hit 'em wit da hee, I hit 'em wit da haa, I hit 'em wit da hee
I hit 'em wit da haa, I stop 'em wit da haa, hee, hee, haa
I hit 'em wit da hee, I hit 'em wit da haa, I hit 'em wit da hee
I hit 'em wit da haa, meet me at the bar, meet me at the bar
