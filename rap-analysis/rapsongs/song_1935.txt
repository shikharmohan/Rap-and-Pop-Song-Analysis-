Huh, this go out to my dog Kato, rest in peace baby
Dogs that I call my friends
Praying for all my friends
Things I do for my friends
We miss you! A'yo Kato!
Started off two dogs with the same goals
Nothin' but two dogs walkin' the same road
Two different cultures, but had the same heart
Enjoyed seeing the light, but lived in the dark
5th Avenue, bumped heads in the parkin' lot
Was a quite brother, didn't like to bark a lot
Came direct, when he came, gave respect
So I gave respect, we shared the same respect
To name regret, in our own circles
Two brothers with good hearts, but if you start
Two brothers that'll hurt you, know how that dirt do
Hittin' four corners, right back upon us, God tried to warn us
But sometimes we don't see
When I first heard I'm like, "This can't be"
Y'all niggaz is bugging, got the wrong information or something
Please tell me these niggaz is frontin', God know
Dogs that I call my friends
Praying for all my friends
Things I do for my friends
We miss you! A'yo Kato!
  (We miss you, Kato)
Dogs that I call my friends
Praying for all my friends
  (We miss you, Kato)
Things I do for my friends
We miss you! A'Yo Kato!
  (We miss you, Kato)
A'yo K' let me kick it with you for a minute
There was things left unsaid, dog, we wasn't finished
Never got to say "Thank You", for bein' a friend
Dogs for life, and you, rode to the end
Held dog down, didn't let a day go by
Every time dog came to the shy
I was good, trips out to Phoenix, with the scrambler squad
Now I come back to Phoenix and like, "Damn it's hard"
To accept the fact, that you won't be comin' back
But I hope you comin' back, 'cos I won't accept the fact
When you came to New York, you had to come to the crib
And vice-versa, yeah, that's just how we did, remote control cars
We would race all day, it was adventure, we would chase our day
So I'm not gonna say goodbye my nigga
Instead I would rather, focus on the time we spent together
That's what matters
Dogs that I call my friends
Praying for all my friends
Things I do for my friends
We miss you! A'yo Kato!
  (We miss you, Kato)
Dogs that I call my friends
Praying for all my friends
  (We miss you, Kato)
Things I do for my friends
We miss you! A'Yo Kato!
  (We miss you, Kato)
Need you to save me a spot, next to you and the lord
Don't know when I'm comin', but keep checkin' the door
But while I'm here, knock on wood
I'll make sure your kids remember who their father was
And Val is good, understood how real niggaz move
We don't part, but ya gonna always have family in New York
Believe that, where you at, you can see that
We dogs for life and to death and I mean that [Incomprehensible]
Dogs that I call my friends
Praying for all my friends
Things I do for my friends
We miss you! A'yo Kato!
  (We miss you, Kato)
Dogs that I call my friends
Praying for all my friends
  (We miss you, Kato)
Things I do for my friends
We miss you! A'Yo Kato!
  (We miss you, Kato)
Yo, where the hood at is banging right now, man
That was your favorite joint, ya know what I mean?
  (We miss you, Kato)
It's going just like we thought it would baby
  (We miss you, Kato)
Aight
(We miss you, Kato!)
(I'll always love you K')
