I know everybody remember their first time
No matter how old you are
You gotta remember that very first time you did something man
Ain't nothing like the first time 
remembering the memories (I remember, I remember)
Ain't nothing like the first time (ok)
or how things used to be (how they used to be girl)
Ain't nothing like the first time (hey mom I'm coming in I won't be too late)
remembering the memories(the green lights come on) 
Ain't nothing like the first time (I gotta have your ass home)
or how things used to be
Ok, come travel with me down memory lane
Back in my wonder years when nobody considered me sane
First time I got a whooping 'sRight where I begin
Cuz what I did I told my mom I'd never do it again
Round four years old and young Luda's a menace (yep)
But I cried the first time I had to go to the dentist
Cuz I was scared then a mug, I couldn't stand no doctors 
But I loved getting drunk my first time off vodka (oh yeah)
'Til the very next morning I was hung on over (uh huh)
Proceeded to throw upon my grandma's sofa
It was nasty, I swore I wouldn't take another sip
The first time getting high I had to take another hit
It wasn't working at first then I started tweaking
Back seat of my boy's ride just laughing for no reason
Been rappin' since I was seve, I remember the time
Plus I wrote my first son when I was nine 
And ain't nothing like the first time
Ain't nothing like the first time 
remembering the memories 
Ain't nothing like the first time 
or how things used to be
Ain't nothing like the first time 
remembering the memories 
Ain't nothing like the first time 
or how things used to be
Oh, you gotta go, you gotta get your ass out
Cuz im my momma come home, well she's likely to pass out man
That's what I said about my bust my first nuts
Cuz all through grade school we tried to bust the first slut
That we could geto our hands on, sex never last long
After sixty seconds tell that trick to put her pants on
It smell like badussy, and I don't like that
I'm about to call her four eyes and I'll be right back
Ain't nothing like the first time 
remembering the memories 
Ain't nothing like the first time 
or how things used to be
Ain't nothing like the first time 
remembering the memories 
Ain't nothing like the first time 
or how things used to be
I got memories in the corner of my mind
Misty watered colored memories, thinking bout the first time
That I learned how to ride my bike
And the first time I got into a fight
Or it could have been the first time 
I got my heart broke by this girl I like
My first time to Atlanta was my first time on a plane
My first time on ecstacy I stood out in the rain
My first time getting grain I was in the backseat of Rudy car
The first time I stole was a sky box, basketball cards, and a candy bar
The first time I heard the legend, we robbed the dope boy
We got about thirty grand out
I was fifteen years old and in high school 
And I had to tall Willy every look stand out
First everything, home brewing, bitch swing
Like Micheal when he won his first championship ring
And he cried with the trophy, that's like my first rhyme
First check for rapping on back for the first time
First met Quincy Jones, he said I looked like Snoop
I remember when me and Chris were in a group
Ain't nothing like the first time 
remembering the memories 
Ain't nothing like the first time 
or how things used to be
Ain't nothing like the first time 
remembering the memories 
Ain't nothing like the first time 
or how things used to be
Ain't nothing like the first time 
remembering the memories 
Ain't nothing like the first time 
or how things used to be
Ain't nothing like the first time 
remembering the memories 
Ain't nothing like the first time 
or how things used to be
And I had to tell Willy every look stand out
