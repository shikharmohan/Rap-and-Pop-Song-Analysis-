Wassup? Nothin' just bangin'
What's up wit you? That's cool
Hey, I just got a call from my momma
You know wha I'm sayin'?
Said she got call from my lawyer
And guess what, guess what?
Lawyer just told me, he told me what it is

I guess you blamed it on the wrong nigga, it ain't mine
I took the test and the results, read it, you was lyin'
But you was cryin' in my motherfuckin' face
And all the while tellin' niggas how you fin to get paid off Kray
Thought you had a bone, bitch got shit all wrong, a y'all know
I was suspicious from the front door
Wasn't surprised when the ho took me to court and say she want do
Now the bitch has got the people in my business
They come to find out, ain't even one of my children
You illin', playin' with these kids man, you're dead wrong
Got this baby callin' me daddy' but daddy's a unsolved mystery
Cause appearently mommy ain't carin' where she sleeps now
What ya gone do? Tell her the truth or say I left you like ho's do

I shoulda knew your ass was drama
Round here tellin' everybody you my baby mama
Sayin' I'm a buy you this and that like I'm your fuckin' spouse
Look your honour, I ain't payin' a dime
Because that young'n right there mine
I ain't lyin', I ain't no deadbeat daddy with intent to be neglectin'
All I wanted was some sex but now she tryin' to get a check
But baby, hold on won't you wait a minute
The DNA a read negative, fuckin' these chickens ain't no way to live
They tryin' to get up in your pockets and break you down
For eighteen years, so who rapin' who now?
Ninety nine point nine percent not, I mean I ain't that baby father
I ain't gotta be bothered with all that bullshit
You stressin' me with, testin' my wits
I'm just about to slap in the clip and do me a bitch
I'm through with this shit, I keep it real with my lady
Now you chickens that play me, don't knock that nigga little Layzie
Mommy, hey mommy
Where's my daddy, where's my daddy?
Mommy, hey mommy
Where's my daddy, where's my daddy?
Mommy, hey mommy
Where's my daddy, where's my daddy?
Mommy, hey mommy
Where's my daddy, where's my daddy?
I chip in cause I'm chillin' enough
Makin' millions, she wants some do, bitch no!
Go get a J O B, willin' to help and I help yourself for sho
I better play daddy comin' out a woman
In which she never had me, sadly, always in transition leavin' gladly
Shit, I tried to be the papi, nothin' 'gainst the baby
Momma can't make me happy, fuck, yeah I'm crazy
My father never knew about me
I was young while another man mad at me
I got no real fam, maybe it's swellin' straight
God I love you Lay', no one get in the way

Why can't we pressure these broads the way they pressure on us
That paper came and it read, that nigga wasn't my son
Why can't we counter sue these bitches on the way they do us
Test one, test two, said I wasn't the one
So you can cancel that money
Ridin' and flossin' my money
Ooh, I know you had a plan, lovely
I hope the real baby daddy live his life, yeah
And you can tell your little girlfriend to stay out my face
I see you ain't told her the results of what you got in your case
You get's nada, what you ain't heard
I ain't the real baby's father, not a dollar
I guess the best is the best, somebody woulda got hurt
'Cause I ain't payin' for nothin', I got for free with no work
You so scandalous, heard about my Benz
Look they came and tried to relate us, damn!
Lawyer just told me, he told me what it is
