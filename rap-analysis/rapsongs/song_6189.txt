Yo, yo, yo check this out
Yo, yo we gon go back to the old school right now
Yo, yo Red
Yo, what's up G?
Yo, yo, yo check this out
I believe there's no nigga out there
As funky as you
True so, what we're gonna do
Is we're gonna go back to the old P
Funkadelic get the fuck outta here, word?
Remember that old cut you did? Yeah, yeah
That ol' P funk cut?
Yeah, make my funk the P funk
Yeah, yeah, that's it
Well, what we gonna do is we gonna reminisce on that ol' shit
Word? We gon go right back to the old school, but before we do
I wanna know is my niggaz in the house?
Hell yeah, I said is my motherfuckin' niggaz in the house?
Hell yeah, So everybody just light your spliffs up
Yeah, get your skunk weed and light that shit up
And let the funk be your guiding light
You heard it comin' from the lungs
Of the funkadelic brother himself
More funk than a bag of skunk
Twice the funk that James Brown's socks
Hit me, hittin' you straight across your notch
Wit a tune yo, Redman, drop it
Make my funk, the P funk
I wants to get funked up
Make my funk the P funk, we thump
Lyrics that bounce the brain, make emcees jump
Sky high can't touch the level so why try?
Fall Guy compare me status to fly guy
Rough and rugged and brother it takes ten to conquer
That's why I'm on probation
Ever since three, I cut throats of emcees
Mediocre lyricist who burnt with degrees
Of two-ten not from an oven, but mac ten
A mac twenty maybe if I didn't subtract ten
My background straight from a black mans culture
Want more, buy the video or Redman sculpture
For your mantle, damn you too hard to handle
E Double slam once and Redman slam two
Break hooks, earthquake shook the state of NJ
Okay, bust the big gate
For microphones that have swollen mic cords
PE fights for power, Redman fights for soul power
Funk is strong as a tree trunk
Ask me the flavor make mines the P funk
Make my funk, the P funk
I wants to get funked up
Make my funk, the P funk
I wants to get funked up
I'm back with the funk, chump
You want funk, how many lumps?
I got spunk I'm well known like Donald Trump
I'm not
