See me clean as I wanna be, but these niggas wanna be
Shots so bright I can't see niggas standing right in front of me
These niggas don't want none of me, this rapping shit is fun to me

Mighta seen me getting gas at the Citgo and he sit the six low
Riding right beside a 45 and what its hitting fo
Shawty ain't bullshitin' folk, he'll be out here hitting folks
Just stick around and try to tell polices what he did it fo
Ain't nuttin' he ain't did before, other niggas getting so
Blurred wit the pussy and bet some even getting so
Long he ain't funny, he got that long money
Naw money, you niggas barely got hit the mall money
I'm the perfect example of how to hit the ground runnin'
From the trap to busting up how the underground stuntin'
So you still see me down at the underground stuntin'
I'ma West side Bank head nigga it ain't nothing

From soft parts to trees you can get it what you need
Get it, get it, I got that get it when you need

I was raised off Easy, 'Cube, Ice T, 8Ball, MJG
'Face, Pimp C, I'ma G best believe me
Try me when you see me and niggas start busting
Like they start busting pushups push a
Button shot calling, niggas not balling
Just doing a lotta loud mouthing and hot dogging
I got the shit locked from Atlanta to New Orleans
Virginia, Mississippi, Kentucky, I run all dat
You niggas better fall back, fo grab a ball bat
Ans take it to ya skull, dats gone be the end of all dat
Insist on having problems, bet dis revolver will solve dat
Hit 'em in the temple then I leave 'em where they fall at
I got that get it, get it, I got that get it what you need

Get it, get it, I got that get it when you need
