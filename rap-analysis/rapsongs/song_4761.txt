Down, down, diggy, diggy, down
Diggedy down, down just look around, my world is goin' down
Disease is spreadin' everywhere, I can cannot be found
This, the season for murder isn't no reason
To hurt another brother but temptation is so pleasin'
And every alley-way, they're gettin' high
On playgrounds they're sellin' crack and every day another baby dies
Pistol whippin', kidnappin', anything can happen
Diggedy down, diggedy down with Old Trafford

Young people, with no education
Politicians, deny and segregation
Young infants, deserted and abandoned
Step parents, lack in understandin'
Homelessness, all across the land, war, man against man
Treachery and evil fillin' our communities and all these hypocrites
Aiy yo, they're stealin' from our charities

Many poisonous chemicals and, boom
Many devilish goals are up, soon
No love where loves' ya dwell in
Mother earth transformed into hell an'
Ice, murders, conspiracy and, schemes
Young boys will reveal their, dreams
Handguns in the hands of the young
And dis all this paranoia
Yo, there's much slugs for everyone

We need to rise
As if we live with our eyes
Stay away from the hate
Before it's too late
We go
Down, down, diggy, diggy, down, down
Down, down, diggy, diggy, down
Down, down, diggy, diggy, down, down
Down, down, diggy, diggy, down
We got to rise
