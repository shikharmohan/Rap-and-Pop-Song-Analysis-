Killa, you're face to face with Scarface
G to the E to the T O
Now here it comes, motherfuckers die hard 'til the end
(Boom)
Mr. Scarface, not your ordinary dope man
On the for reala, my nigga, I'm a born killa
Let my nuts hanging out, give a fuck if ya bigger
'Cause I'm that nigga who gets ass rolling ten deep
And shove this shoe up in your shit far as ten feet
Creep by creep 'cause I'm in this shit deep
Never ever caught slipping, bitch 'cause I don't sleep
And if I sleep, the kid gets beat and that's bullshit
'Cause I'm still a lunatic
Body snatcher, Peter Roll capture
Killer coming atcha, niggero subtracter
Small time dope game, plenty heart though
Good girl go bad, I'm high off a motherfucker
I read my diary, mind play tricks
And traveled the world with a nigga named Bushwick
Lost a member back in December
Nigga gets respect from Boston to Denver
Compton, Jersey, Philly, Brooklyn
Oakland, Dallas, Houston look, man
It ain't a goddamn thing being took
From the bad boys of Houston, so go ahead and dial a crook
And watch some niggas spit the game cool
Ran back and brace yourself, nigga 'cause here it comes, fool
Here it comes, fool
P E T E R M A N, ain't no hoe ass motherfuckers
Bang bang bang, motherfuckers, lay it down
Prat tat tat, the Peterman is in the house
And I'm about to spray it down
Letting niggas hand fit my gat, I gots to grab it
Smoking motherfuckers is a habit
I'm on a  mission, opposition get tore up from the floor up
Kicking the type of gangsta shit that make ya throw up
G plus E plus T plus O
Geto Boys run shit in '93 but you don't hear me though
Huh, breaking niggas off who bother to
Fuck around with techs, thinking we ain't nothing but barbecue
So fool, get your ass on
Before the Peterman in the house, getting his blast on
Sending niggas smooth to the concrete
Making mo' motherfucking deal then a swap meet
The C O N V I C T S is hitting niggas where it hurt
Kicking up dirt down in Texas, so here it comes, fool
Any motherfucker wanna get with Bushwick
Bring it on, motherfucker
Well, what do you know, it's that nigga named Bushwick
Back again still dropping the Bs on a punk bitch
Kicking that G shit ever so clear
5th Ward steady coming hard every fucking year
I went from copping the cash a couple of months ago
But niggas call me crazy 'cause I'm known to smoke a hoe
Smoke a hoe, smoke a hoe, smoke two, smoke a few
Got my motherfucking crew, now what you wanna do?
B U S H W I C K blowing niggas away
Doing this type of shit every motherfucking day
Never waste another niggas time
Got my 9, getting paid, kicking these motherfucking dope rhymes
So if it comes down to it, I might gatcha
Dead in that motherfucking dump, give that ass a fracture
'Cause I ain't that nigga you wanna fuck with
Bushwick Bill, the nigga named Chuckwick
So here it comes, fool
