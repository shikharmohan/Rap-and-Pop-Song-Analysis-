[Verse 1] 
Tell you what I did last night 
I came home, say, around a quater to three 
Still so high 
Hypnotized 
In a trance 
From the start it, so buttery brown and tantalizing 
You woulda thought I needed help from this feeling that I felt 
So shook I had to catch my breath 
[Chorus:] 
Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head 
Oh my 
Oops, there goes my skirt dropin' to my feet 
Oh my 
Ooh, some kinda touch caressing my legs 
Oh my 
Ooh I'm turning red 
Who could this be? 
I tried and I tried to avoid 
but this thing was happening 
Swallow my pride 
Let it ride and party 
But this body felt just like mines 
I got worried 
I looked over to the left 
A reflection of myself 
That's why I couldn't catch my breath 
[Chorus:] 
Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head 
Oh my 
Oops, there goes my skirt dropin' to my feet 
Oh my 
Ooh, some kinda touch caressing my legs 
Oh my 
[Missy] 
(I looked over to the left) 
Umm I was looking so good I couldn't reject myself 
(I looked over to the left) 
Umm I was feeling so good I had to touch myself 
(I looked over to the left) 
Umm I was eyein my thighs butter pecan brown 
(I looked over to the left) 
Umm comin outta my shirt and then the skirt came down 
[Chorus 2x:] 
Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head 
Oh my 
Oops, there goes my skirt dropin' to my feet 
Oh my 
Ooh, some kinda touch caressing my legs 
Oh my 
Ooh I'm turning red 
Who could this be? 
Ooh My
