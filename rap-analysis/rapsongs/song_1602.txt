Yo, yo, yo, check this out, man
1 for you, 2 for me
3 for you, 15 for me
20 for you, now check it out
Yo, I just won 10 grand in the Galactic
Rhyme Federation Championship, so I'm lampin' a bit
I feel like returnin' to Earth and burnin' some herb
I'm sick of lookin' at the inside of space stations
Time for Deltron to take a vacation
My expertise in aviation got us to our destination
The East Bay, my livin' quarters is completely froze solid
I thaw it out with a heat ray
Now I'm chillin' in a sauna, pulsatin' jet streams
Peepin' out in virtual reality my wet dreams
Perusin' my 21st century classic comics
The fun is astronomic
I figured since I'm here I'll renew my galactic passport
So I'm not persecuted by no galactic assholes
Schemers on the ave with their holographic hat tricks
Usin' magnetism to pick-pocket citizens
Tourists walk around with memory apprehension glasses
They attempt to capture the past tense
Virtual junkies, burnt out and lost
War veterans still trapped in the Holocaust
Yes, I know all the answers
Livin' in my true love's arms
I'm sittin' on the porch readin' Cosmopolitan
Peepin' all these dumb hoes with enhanced collagen
I'm calling in sick today, big mistake
This resulted in a final pay check and pink slip to say
Replaced by my successor 'cause I missed my place
Knowin' that the Rhyme Federation will miss my face
Referred to as a big disgrace
Now I'm free-lance with more risk to take
Now a rhymin' merk, findin' certified androids
Hit a convention, signin' autographs for fan boys
They admire my enhanced stanzas
And how I dodge manhunts and security cameras
Avoided apprehension in sub-atomic dimensions
And even more impressive 'cause of what we livin'
A self contained environment, I suggest I'm just a minor threat
I see a thing of beauty fly as heck, standin' by her desk
Paid her my respects, I was too scared to try to step
So I deployed one of my androids with dialect
Synthesized with my voice perfectly replicated
Asked for her name, and was she married? "No, we're separated"
Booty, hey, baby, you're lookin', you're lookin' real fine
Your behind, you got 3 booty cheeks
That's kind of unique for, for a [Incomprehensible]
What say me and you hit the hot spot over at your house?
I got a few sandwiches [Incomprehensible] would be eaten
Yo, it's cool though, you got, you got one eye
[Incomprehensible] trippin' though
Listen you, me and you, we gon' places, baby
We gon' far, go all the way to Mars, Venus
We'll go to Venus if you want to
Venus, Paris 'coz I got, haha
Yes I know all the answers
Livin' in my true love's arms
Yes, I know all the answers
Livin' in my true love's arms
