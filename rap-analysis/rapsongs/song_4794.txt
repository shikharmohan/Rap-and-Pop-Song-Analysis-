They said I wasn't rough, too much dough, he got an old flow
Every time you open your mouth, you feel your elbow
I'll catch a felony on top of a melody
Brought a family and dough, woulda been so happily
I'll beat the Laker off of a clown and chop him down to size
Sick of all these wanna-be bad guys
Made loot, many G's, bought a crib where I live
Told my kids, "Yo damn", that I'm a fugitive
Runnin' from the streets and our beats, the sad sheets
A sunny beach, video hoes within reach
Farmers Boulevard, liberty and forty is gone
And E ain't put nobody on
When I came back to smack and give 'em a welt
Like belts makin' them strip and all of that
Punks better run for they guns
I'm not the one and can't nobody rule until L's done
It's the L baby, baby, the L baby, baby
It's the L baby, baby, the heart, the maker

It's the L baby, baby, the L baby, baby
It's the L baby, baby, the heart, the maker

It's the L baby, baby, the L baby, baby

I worked the Murphy on the mix, what's wrong
With these stupid lunatics playin' Joint for a drag-bit?
I'm harder than, find in a jar, people wasn't rippin'
These records, all of y'all would get robbed
I'm comin' straight out the barrel with your name on my arm
Blowin' the hoody of your head like a home-made bomb
I'm big and so you figured I would relax
Don't ever sleep, I'll wake ya up with an ax
The Boulevard ain't safe for my beats, drop the herb
Twenty times harder without a curse
Makin' rats flee, hardcore and that's me
The baddest soloist in hip-hop history
L L C to the O, to the O L J
So whatcha wanna know?
Throw ya in the MVP on your knees G
A crowbar in your mouth, now ask me
It's the L baby, baby, the L baby, baby
It's the L baby, baby, the heart, the maker

It's the L baby, baby, the L baby, baby

Who's the man on the mic? The L, the L

My territory's hard, I'm rollin' with one railguard
The microphone is my credit card
Blowin' your boots off, reload, you're too soft
Usin' a butcher's knife to make your whole root call
I heard somebody said, "His skills wasn't good"
I'm lettin' eighty tigers loose in his neighborhood
I pop the wheelies on my bike, lickin' shots
And laughin' everytime you sneak a weak paragraph in
You blowin' your mind, blunted and coked all the time
Ain't nuttin' changed, you wrote another wack rhyme
I'll leave your bullet-riddled body on the curb
Lookin' slerve with a T-shirt, don't disturb the herbs
You're the next contestant tonight
Come on down to my shake clown, the slice is right
Rip your jaw out the socket, been rockin' for years
Tell the troop, you're still look with E and drop it
As I deaftify your eye, competition tries to match my size
Buryin' the acts and your back will be rhymes and tracks
While you're sleepin' like a sleaze-stack, believe that
It's the L baby, baby, the L baby, baby
It's the L baby, baby, the heart, the maker

It's the L baby, baby, the L baby, baby
